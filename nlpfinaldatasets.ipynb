00:00:48.747\\nand you have a cousin who needs some help.\\n\\n00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:50.392\\nHow does it all spring from this?\\n\\n00:00:50.392 --> 00:00:52.246\\nSal: Yeah; she needed help.\\n\\n00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:53.598\\nShe\\'s 12 years old.\\n\\n00:00:53.598 --> 00:00:55.969\\nShe was in New Orleans,\\nwhich is where I grew up.\\n\\n00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.391\\nI was in Boston at the time.\\n\\n00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.558\\nI offered to tutor her\\neveryday after work for me,\\n\\n00:00:59.558 --> 00:01:01.935\\nafter school for her; she agreed.\\n\\n00:01:02.211 --> 00:01:03.748\\nIt worked out.\\n\\n00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:07.263\\nWe just work out, do it\\nover the phone, and we used\\n\\n00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:09.756\\na little bit of this Yahoo\\nChat to kind of communicate.\\n\\n00:01:09.756 --> 00:01:12.764\\nShe eventually got into the kind of\\n\\n00:01:12.764 --> 00:01:14.762\\nthe more appropriate math track for her,\\n\\n00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:16.647\\nand I start tutoring her brothers.\\n\\n00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:19.182\\nWord got around in the family\\nthat free tutoring was happening.\\n\\n00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:20.950\\nSo, you fast forward about 18 months,\\n\\n00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.747\\nand I was tutoring about\\n10 or 15 family members\\n\\n00:01:23.747 --> 00:01:25.849\\neveryday after work; and it was a friend-\\n\\n00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:27.679\\nBy this point, I had moved\\nout to Northern California,\\n\\n00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.947\\nand a friend said, \"Well,\\nto help yoursef scale,\\n\\n00:01:29.947 --> 00:01:32.054\\n\"why don\\'t you put some\\nof these on YouTube?\"\\n\\n00:01:32.054 --> 00:01:35.197\\nand I thought it was a silly\\nidea, that YouTube was for\\n\\n00:01:35.197 --> 00:01:39.195\\ncats playing piano, but I gave it a shot.\\n\\n00:01:39.195 --> 00:01:41.779\\n&gt;From there, it just caught on, I guess.\\n\\n00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:44.472\\nLarry: How long did it take\\nfor the word to get out\\n\\n00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:46.913\\nand for people to start\\nusing these videos?\\n\\n00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:51.062\\nSal: It was just this I\\nthink word of mouth thing,\\n\\n00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:53.979\\nthat starting in 2006 a parent\\nwould tell another parent,\\n\\n00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.294\\na student would tell another student,\\n\\n00:01:55.294 --> 00:01:56.654\\na teacher would tell another teacher.\\n\\n00:01:56.654 --> 00:02:00.349\\nBy 2009, there were several\\nhundreds of thousands\\n\\n00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.380\\nof people using it on a regular basis.\\n\\n00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.849\\nThat\\'s when I quit my day\\njob to start this as a\\n\\n00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:07.748\\nnot for profit and work on this full time,\\n\\n00:02:07.748 --> 00:02:11.348\\nand then, by 2010, it had grown.\\n\\n00:02:11.348 --> 00:02:14.149\\nBy that point, we started to get\\na little bit of press as well.\\n\\n00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.549\\nWe\\'re now at about\\nalmost 7 million students\\n\\n00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:18.411\\nevery month are using it.\\n\\n00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:18.852\\nLarry: Wow.\\n\\n00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:22.452\\nThere\\'s a criticism from\\nThe Washington Post,\\n\\n00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:26.152\\nwhere this teacher has his\\nown company, I guess it is,\\n\\n00:02:26.152 --> 00:02:28.808\\nand was featured in a blog\\nin The Washington Post,\\n\\n00:02:28.808 --> 00:02:32.151\\nand part of the knock was\\nthat you said you spend\\n\\n00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:33.951\\na couple of minutes researching and do it,\\n\\n00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:36.650\\nbut I thought part of the\\nappeal of the videos is\\n\\n00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.303\\nthere is a sort of a naturalness there.\\n\\n00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:43.339\\nIt\\'s the less formal aspect of\\nit I think is part of the appeal.\\n\\n00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:44.053\\nSal: Yeah.\\n\\n00:02:44.053 --> 00:02:46.052\\nI think there\\'s two\\ndimensions to preparation.\\n\\n00:02:46.052 --> 00:02:48.472\\nI think one dimension is\\npreparation of your mind,\\n\\n00:02:48.472 --> 00:02:50.555\\nwhich is hopefully happened\\nover your entire lifetime,\\n\\n00:02:50.555 --> 00:02:52.889\\nbut obviously if I go\\ninto a topic that I\\'m not\\n\\n00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:55.472\\nexpert in at the moment,\\nI will spend hours on it.\\n\\n00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:58.550\\nBut I agree with you.\\n\\n00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.670\\nI think what people connected to\\nwas it was very conversational.\\n\\n00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.750\\nThey could tell it was some guy\\nmaking this for his cousins.\\n\\n00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.385\\nI didn\\'t edit out my thought processes.\\n\\n00:03:07.385 --> 00:03:09.390\\nYou could kind of hear\\nme thinking in real time.\\n\\n00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.752\\nSometimes I would go down one avenue,\\n\\n00:03:11.752 --> 00:03:13.751\\nthat was a logical avenue, but say,\\n\\n00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.069\\n\"Well actually, this isn\\'t working out.\\n\\n00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.894\\n\"Let\\'s back up.\"\\n\\n00:03:15.894 --> 00:03:17.751\\nToo often in math and science,\\n\\n00:03:17.751 --> 00:03:20.389\\nyou just get the final\\nsolution, and it seems\\n\\n00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.671\\nso easy and perfect, but\\nit seems impossible to you.\\n\\n00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:25.262\\nI think people appreciated\\nthat it felt much more human,\\n\\n00:03:25.262 --> 00:03:26.730\\nmuch more approachable in this way.\\n\\n00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.649\\nLarry: Much like it is\\nin a show like this,\\n\\n00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.151\\nwhich is unscripted and a conversation,\\n\\n00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:33.559\\nor a program like Morning Edition,\\n\\n00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.471\\nwhere it\\'s all scripted\\nand you have two anchors.\\n\\n00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:36.883\\nBoth have their place.\\n\\n00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.154\\nThey\\'re just different approaches.\\n\\n00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:39.059\\nSal: Exactly.\\n\\n00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.152\\nI think when I talk to a lot of\\n... and I\\'ve had the privilege of\\n\\n00:03:42.152 --> 00:03:44.552\\nworking with a lot of amazing\\nteachers, and they tell me.\\n\\n00:03:44.552 --> 00:03:46.561\\nI mean, the things that\\nconnect with students more\\n\\n00:03:46.561 --> 00:03:48.051\\nare the ones that are unscripted.\\n\\n00:03:48.051 --> 00:03:50.159\\nYour mind has to be very\\nclear and very distilled about\\n\\n00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.651\\nwhat you want to talk\\nabout and how you might\\n\\n00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:54.386\\ncommunicate it, but\\nhumans realize when you\\'re\\n\\n00:03:54.386 --> 00:03:56.490\\nreading something versus\\nwhen you\\'re actually\\n\\n00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:57.766\\nthinking and communicating\\nfrom your heart.\\n\\n00:03:57.766 --> 00:04:01.990\\nLarry: Let\\'s talk about\\ntaking this as a model\\n\\n00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.985\\nand incorporating it into\\nthe classroom in Los Altos,\\n\\n00:04:04.985 --> 00:04:08.166\\nup in the Bay Area, where you reside.\\n\\n00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.842\\nThey\\'re actually incorporating this.\\n\\n00:04:09.842 --> 00:04:10.848\\nHow does it work?\\n\\n00:04:10.848 --> 00:04:13.051\\nSal: They first reached out to us 2010,\\n\\n00:04:13.051 --> 00:04:14.451\\nwhen we got our first real funding from\\n\\n00:04:14.451 --> 00:04:16.185\\nGoogle and the Gates\\nFoundation to work on this.\\n\\n00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:18.951\\nAt the time, we thought it was\\na completely supplemental thing.\\n\\n00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.099\\nKhan Academy is your free tutor out there.\\n\\n00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.760\\nBut, as I write about in the book,\\n\\n00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.273\\nthey kind of reached out to us and said,\\n\\n00:04:24.273 --> 00:04:26.847\\n\"What would you do with a\\n5th grade math classroom,\\n\\n00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:28.738\\n\"now that you exist, your tools exist?\"\\n\\n00:04:28.738 --> 00:04:31.637\\nI said, \"I don\\'t think\\nit makes sense to use\\n\\n00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.787\\n\"class time to give lectures anymore.\\n\\n00:04:33.787 --> 00:04:36.357\\n\"Lectures might be useful, but now you can\\n\\n00:04:36.357 --> 00:04:38.537\\n\"pause and repeat and\\nwatch them on demand.\\n\\n00:04:38.537 --> 00:04:40.537\\n\"Let\\'s use class time for\\nsomething more constructive.\\n\\n00:04:40.537 --> 00:04:42.643\\n\"Why don\\'t we ask student\\nteaching each other?\\n\\n00:04:42.643 --> 00:04:44.739\\n\"Why don\\'t we have more one\\non one time with the teacher?\"\\n\\n00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:47.244\\nAnd as soon as you also remove\\nlectures from the classroom,\\n\\n00:04:47.244 --> 00:04:49.239\\nnow, all of a sudden,\\nyou don\\'t have to have\\n\\n00:04:49.239 --> 00:04:50.737\\nevery student working at the same pace.\\n\\n00:04:50.737 --> 00:04:52.743\\nYou could have them all kind of\\n\\n00:04:52.743 --> 00:04:54.440\\nmastering concepts then moving on.\\n\\n00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.982\\nThey thought it was an interesting\\nidea, so they gave it a shot.\\n\\n00:04:57.982 --> 00:05:01.561\\nThis was two years ago, and since\\nthen it\\'s been district-wide,\\n\\n00:05:01.561 --> 00:05:04.238\\nand they\\'ve been seeing some\\npretty interesting results.\\n\\n00:05:04.238 --> 00:05:07.440\\nLarry: You know the\\ncriticism that some have,\\n\\n00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.143\\nthe concern is that for the students\\n\\n00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:11.739\\nwho don\\'t have much parental support,\\n\\n00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.055\\nhave difficult time\\ngetting access to computer,\\n\\n00:05:14.055 --> 00:05:15.393\\nthey\\'re going to be left behind,\\n\\n00:05:15.393 --> 00:05:17.063\\nand the whiz kids are going to do great\\n\\n00:05:17.063 --> 00:05:18.645\\nbecause they can go at their own pace.\\n\\n00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:20.737\\nSal: Well, I think this addresses that\\n\\n00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:22.491\\nmore than the traditional model does.\\n\\n00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:24.739\\nThe traditional model\\nthat we all grew up in,\\n\\n00:05:24.739 --> 00:05:26.388\\nyou go home, you have homework,\\n\\n00:05:26.388 --> 00:05:28.238\\nand that\\'s where frankly\\na lot of the learning\\n\\n00:05:28.238 --> 00:05:30.480\\nshould happen, when you\\'re\\ndoing the problem solving.\\n\\n00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.386\\nIt\\'s the educated kids\\nwho have older siblings,\\n\\n00:05:34.386 --> 00:05:36.090\\nor who have parents who might be able to\\n\\n00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.426\\nhelp them on the\\nschoolwork, or whose parents\\n\\n00:05:38.426 --> 00:05:39.804\\nare even home and they\\'re not at work,\\n\\n00:05:39.804 --> 00:05:41.473\\nand then they go to class\\nand they do something\\n\\n00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:43.057\\nvery passive and they get frustrated.\\n\\n00:05:43.057 --> 00:05:45.393\\nWhat we\\'re advocating is\\nthat actually doing the\\n\\n00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:47.338\\nproblem-solving, which is\\na much more important part,\\n\\n00:05:47.338 --> 00:05:50.239\\nin class, where they\\'re\\nsurrounded by peers\\n\\n00:05:50.239 --> 00:05:51.540\\nand they have a support network,\\n\\n00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.282\\nso you don\\'t have the child whose parents\\n\\n00:05:53.282 --> 00:05:55.037\\naren\\'t home from work or\\nwhose parents don\\'t have\\n\\n00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:57.320\\na high school diploma, who can\\'t help them\\n\\n00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.357\\non an algebra homework,\\ngetting frustrated.\\n\\n00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:00.781\\nNow they\\'re in class; they\\'re surrounded.\\n\\n00:06:00.781 --> 00:06:02.940\\nThey have the teacher, the\\npeers, there\\'s a ton of help.\\n\\n00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.776\\nThere\\'s one classroom\\nwhere there was a student\\n\\n00:06:04.776 --> 00:06:06.039\\nwho spoke very little English.\\n\\n00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:09.037\\nIn a traditional classroom,\\nthat kid would just be\\n\\n00:06:09.037 --> 00:06:11.275\\nleft behind, even though\\nactually we found out\\n\\n00:06:11.275 --> 00:06:12.688\\nhe was quite good at mathematics.\\n\\n00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:14.934\\nWhat allowed to happen\\nin this model is that\\n\\n00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:17.540\\nthe teacher was able to\\nspend extra time with him.\\n\\n00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.370\\nThe teacher didn\\'t speak Spanish,\\n\\n00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.782\\nbut several of the students\\ndid, and so the students\\n\\n00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:23.539\\nwere able to be peer tutors and make sure\\n\\n00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.239\\nthat the student could keep up.\\n\\n00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.238\\nI think there is an issue\\nabout access to technology,\\n\\n00:06:28.238 --> 00:06:30.692\\nand we are working at\\ncharter schools in San Jose\\n\\n00:06:30.692 --> 00:06:32.939\\nand Oakland, places that\\nare more underserved,\\n\\n00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:36.268\\nbut actually they were seeing\\nsome of the biggest gains.\\n\\n00:06:36.268 --> 00:06:38.951\\nThe trick is how do we give\\naccess to the technology?\\n\\n00:06:38.951 --> 00:06:41.757\\nBut you could do it by keeping\\ncomputer labs open longer,\\n\\n00:06:41.757 --> 00:06:43.749\\nby having after school\\nprograms and other things.\\n\\n00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:45.668\\nLarry: So even if they\\'re\\nnot a quiet space at home,\\n\\n00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:47.674\\nthere\\'s another place that kids can go\\n\\n00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.257\\nto see those lectures.\\n\\n00:06:49.257 --> 00:06:50.757\\nWe\\'re talking with Salman Khan.\\n\\n00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:53.168\\nHe\\'s the founder of the\\nnonprofit Khan Academy,\\n\\n00:06:53.168 --> 00:06:55.506\\nand author of The One World School House:\\n\\n00:06:55.506 --> 00:06:58.595\\nEducation Reimagined;\\nand part of the case that\\n\\n00:06:58.595 --> 00:07:00.668\\nhe makes in this book is that the kind of\\n\\n00:07:00.668 --> 00:07:03.540\\nlow cost delivery of\\neducation in this model\\n\\n00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.257\\ncould revolutionize\\nunderdeveloped countries,\\n\\n00:07:06.257 --> 00:07:09.451\\nthose that just don\\'t\\nhave access to education,\\n\\n00:07:09.451 --> 00:07:12.944\\nthat this could be a huge\\nway of addressing that.\\n\\n00:07:12.944 --> 00:07:14.669\\nHow would you, though, deal with\\n\\n00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:17.174\\nthat kind of problem\\nsolving, the in classroom,\\n\\n00:07:17.174 --> 00:07:20.520\\nthe need for the educated professional?\\n\\n00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.668\\nSal: Yeah, well, in the developed world,\\n\\n00:07:22.668 --> 00:07:24.509\\nwhere students have access to a teacher,\\n\\n00:07:24.509 --> 00:07:28.595\\nI think this supercharges\\nthat physical part of it.\\n\\n00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:31.750\\nThis isn\\'t about virtual versus physical.\\n\\n00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.050\\nIt\\'s not Amazon.com\\nversus Barnes and Noble\\'s.\\n\\n00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.056\\nThis is about let\\'s take\\nlecture off the table,\\n\\n00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.655\\nbecause lecture, and we have\\nin the book a study that proved\\n\\n00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:43.576\\nthat lecture is probably the\\nworst possible use of time\\n\\n00:07:43.576 --> 00:07:45.152\\nand very little learning actually goes on,\\n\\n00:07:45.152 --> 00:07:47.751\\nmake that on demand, at a student\\'s time,\\n\\n00:07:47.751 --> 00:07:49.570\\nthey can remediate and not be embarassed,\\n\\n00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:51.789\\nand make class time all\\nabout problem solving,\\n\\n00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:53.287\\nall about interaction with the teachers.\\n\\n00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:54.954\\nSo, in our mind, if you have a teacher,\\n\\n00:07:54.954 --> 00:07:56.751\\nthey become that much more valuable\\n\\n00:07:56.751 --> 00:07:58.371\\nbecause you get to interact with them.\\n\\n00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:01.151\\nIn the developing world, you\\nhave a different problem.\\n\\n00:08:01.151 --> 00:08:03.452\\nEven if you have the\\nresources, you might not have\\n\\n00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:06.551\\na teacher in the village\\nwho can address that topic.\\n\\n00:08:06.551 --> 00:08:09.648\\nEven if you do, the students are\\nat all different skill levels.\\n\\n00:08:09.648 --> 00:08:10.783\\nSome might be illiterate.\\n\\n00:08:10.783 --> 00:08:13.146\\nSome might be somehow roughly\\nat their own grade level.\\n\\n00:08:13.146 --> 00:08:15.440\\nWhat we say is, in those context,\\n\\n00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.877\\nand there\\'s an orphanage in Mongolia,\\n\\n00:08:16.877 --> 00:08:19.223\\nactually several that\\nare using us in this way,\\n\\n00:08:19.223 --> 00:08:21.646\\nit\\'s better than nothing.\\n\\n00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:23.957\\nIt can give you a very\\nstrong academic scaffold.\\n\\n00:08:23.957 --> 00:08:26.375\\nYou have a community of learners\\nonline who can help you.\\n\\n00:08:26.375 --> 00:08:27.569\\nAnd sometimes you\\'re getting help\\n\\n00:08:27.569 --> 00:08:29.952\\nfrom a teacher on the\\nother side of the planet,\\n\\n00:08:29.952 --> 00:08:31.576\\nor another student on the\\nother side of the planet.\\n\\n00:08:31.576 --> 00:08:32.936\\nOr some of these kids are actually\\n\\n00:08:32.936 --> 00:08:34.451\\nhelping kids in the developed world.\\n\\n00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:37.653\\nSo, for us, it\\'s not an either/or.\\n\\n00:08:37.653 --> 00:08:39.683\\nThe ideal is you have amazing teachers,\\n\\n00:08:39.683 --> 00:08:41.897\\nbut if you have nothing,\\nlike these orphanages\\n\\n00:08:41.897 --> 00:08:43.650\\nin Mongolia, you\\'re getting something.\\n\\n00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.250\\nLarry: You can use\\nwebcams, things like that\\n\\n00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:48.486\\nto be able to make a two-way,\\n\\n00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:51.393\\ninteractive followup to online lectures?\\n\\n00:08:51.393 --> 00:08:53.064\\nSal: Yeah, that\\'s stuff\\nthat we have planned.\\n\\n00:08:53.064 --> 00:08:54.750\\nI talk a lot about it in the book.\\n\\n00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.394\\nI think Khan Academy is in\\nvery, very early stages,\\n\\n00:08:57.394 --> 00:08:58.985\\nand we set it up as a not for profit,\\n\\n00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:01.342\\nso it really has this potential\\nto be this institution\\n\\n00:09:01.342 --> 00:09:03.897\\nto deliver education\\nfor the world for free.\\n\\n00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:06.144\\nI hope in 50 or 100 years, well after ...\\n\\n00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:07.853\\nwell, hopefully I\\'m around in 50 years,\\n\\n00:09:07.853 --> 00:09:11.250\\nbut even after I\\'m gone,\\npeople will still be\\n\\n00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.066\\nworking on the problem\\nof how can we make this\\n\\n00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.393\\nmore interactive, more engaging,\\n\\n00:09:14.393 --> 00:09:15.751\\nand connect more learners\\naround the world?\\n\\n00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:17.752\\nLarry: Salman Khan,\\nauthor of The One World\\n\\n00:09:17.752 --> 00:09:20.650\\nSchool House: Education Reimagined.\\n\\n00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.254\\nI\\'d love to hear from you\\nyour questions or comments\\n\\n00:09:23.254 --> 00:09:26.051\\nabout Khan Academy, about the more than\\n\\n00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:29.293\\n3,200 YouTube teaching\\nvideos that are there,\\n\\n00:09:29.293 --> 00:09:31.230\\nhow it\\'s being used by school districts,\\n\\n00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.329\\nby individual schools as well.\\n\\n00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:40.230\\nWe\\'re at 866-893-KPCC, 866-893-5722,\\n\\n00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.871\\nor the AirTalk page at KPCC.org.\\n\\n00:09:43.871 --> 00:09:46.530\\nTR asked an interesting\\nquestion he has on the page,\\n\\n00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:48.956\\n\"Are there tests that an\\nadult can take to assess\\n\\n00:09:48.956 --> 00:09:52.230\\ntheir math shortcomings\\non the Khan Academy site?\"\\n\\n00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.126\\nSal: Yeah.\\n\\n00:09:53.126 --> 00:09:54.829\\nThat\\'s what we\\'re working on right now.\\n\\n00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:56.552\\nWe already have a significant exercise.\\n\\n00:09:56.552 --> 00:09:58.380\\nAnyone can go to Khan Academy, log in.\\n\\n00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.728\\nActually, our team now, we\\'re\\n36 people; it\\'s not just me.\\n\\n00:10:00.728 --> 00:10:03.041\\nMost of them are software\\nengineers and educators\\n\\n00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:05.557\\nwho are working on exactly\\nwhat\\'s being described.\\n\\n00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:07.329\\nYou get as many problems as you need.\\n\\n00:10:07.329 --> 00:10:08.289\\nIt assesses you.\\n\\n00:10:08.289 --> 00:10:09.742\\nIt keeps progressing you forward.\\n\\n00:10:09.742 --> 00:10:11.295\\nYou get feedback on what you\\'re doing.\\n\\n00:10:11.295 --> 00:10:13.629\\nWhat we want to do is\\nbroaden that to well beyond\\n\\n00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.631\\nmathematics, so you can\\nget assessment on things,\\n\\n00:10:15.631 --> 00:10:17.785\\ndiagnostics, and then show what you know,\\n\\n00:10:17.785 --> 00:10:19.329\\nand if you\\'re having\\ntrouble in a certain domain,\\n\\n00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.372\\nthere are these tutorials\\nthat can help you out.\\n\\n00:10:21.372 --> 00:10:22.631\\nLarry: One thing I forgot to mention,\\n\\n00:10:22.631 --> 00:10:25.230\\nbecause this is really a\\ncentral part of your approach,\\n\\n00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.929\\nis that everybody needs to be able to show\\n\\n00:10:27.929 --> 00:10:30.036\\nthat they\\'ve mastered a step before\\n\\n00:10:30.036 --> 00:10:31.459\\nthey move on to the next one,\\n\\n00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:34.542\\nand schools are in a tough\\nspot trying to do that.\\n\\n00:10:34.542 --> 00:10:37.290\\nSal: I talked about in\\nthe book pretty heavily is\\n\\n00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:40.829\\nall the debate about education\\nessentially misses the point.\\n\\n00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:43.729\\nIt\\'s all kind of on the fringes\\nof this model that we have\\n\\n00:10:43.729 --> 00:10:46.131\\nthat few people realize we\\ninherited from the Prussians,\\n\\n00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:49.630\\na country that does not\\nexist anymore, 200 years ago.\\n\\n00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.547\\nThe Prussian model was based on how do we\\n\\n00:10:52.547 --> 00:10:54.527\\neducate a lot of people cost effectively?\\n\\n00:10:54.527 --> 00:10:56.638\\nWell, it was the beginning\\nof the industrial revolution,\\n\\n00:10:56.638 --> 00:10:57.835\\nso we\\'ll do the same thing.\\n\\n00:10:57.835 --> 00:11:00.223\\nWe\\'ll bash them together\\nin these age cohorts.\\n\\n00:11:00.223 --> 00:11:01.545\\nThey go to the same pace.\\n\\n00:11:01.545 --> 00:11:03.837\\nThey go to these stations,\\nwhich are these classes.\\n\\n00:11:03.837 --> 00:11:05.553\\nKnowledge is applied to them.\\n\\n00:11:05.553 --> 00:11:07.736\\nSome, it sticks; some, it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n00:11:07.736 --> 00:11:10.637\\nThen you sift out the product,\\nand some become doctors\\n\\n00:11:10.637 --> 00:11:13.337\\nand some don\\'t become\\ndoctors or engineers.\\n\\n00:11:13.337 --> 00:11:15.964\\nWhat we\\'re saying is we think we can\\n\\n00:11:15.964 --> 00:11:17.543\\nbreak out of that\\nPrussian model now because\\n\\n00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:19.882\\nthat Prussian model\\npretty much dooms people\\n\\n00:11:19.882 --> 00:11:21.969\\nto hit walls in their understanding.\\n\\n00:11:21.969 --> 00:11:25.336\\nRight now, in the model,\\nyou get a C on your exam\\n\\n00:11:25.336 --> 00:11:28.337\\non basic exponents, it moves you\\nto the next topic the next week,\\n\\n00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:30.238\\nwhere you go to negative\\nexponents or logarithms,\\n\\n00:11:30.238 --> 00:11:31.936\\nsomehow expecting you to master that,\\n\\n00:11:31.936 --> 00:11:34.480\\neven though you had that weak foundation.\\n\\n00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.401\\nAnd so, we say no.\\n\\n00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:39.067\\nMaster that concept, at least\\nget a basic proficiency in it,\\n\\n00:11:39.067 --> 00:11:42.096\\nand only then is it realistic\\nfor you to be able to\\n\\n00:11:42.096 --> 00:11:43.800\\nunderstand something\\nthat builds on top of it.\\n\\n00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.932\\nLarry: It\\'s funny, when I was in\\n6th grade, it was way pre-Internet,\\n\\n00:11:46.932 --> 00:11:50.047\\nI was in an experimental\\nclassroom public school\\n\\n00:11:50.047 --> 00:11:51.738\\nin Inglewood here in Southern California.\\n\\n00:11:51.738 --> 00:11:54.139\\nThey were trying something\\nwhere they combine\\n\\n00:11:54.139 --> 00:11:57.939\\n5th and 6th grade, so it\\nwas a joint classroom,\\n\\n00:11:57.939 --> 00:12:00.337\\nand there was almost no lecture.\\n\\n00:12:00.337 --> 00:12:01.837\\nThe teacher sat in the middle of the room,\\n\\n00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:05.462\\nand we had work stations in\\ndifferent subject areas, again,\\n\\n00:12:05.462 --> 00:12:09.430\\nso there are no videos, essentially,\\nbut all kinds of stations.\\n\\n00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.337\\nYou work at your own pace.\\n\\n00:12:10.337 --> 00:12:11.966\\nThere were tests along\\nthe way to make sure\\n\\n00:12:11.966 --> 00:12:13.547\\nyou had mastery before you moved on;\\n\\n00:12:13.547 --> 00:12:15.960\\nand it was my favorite\\nyear of school, because\\n\\n00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:19.138\\nin areas where I was good,\\nI could go really fast;\\n\\n00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:22.046\\nin areas where I needed more\\nhelp, I had the teacher available,\\n\\n00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:24.882\\none on one, to be able\\nto help me through it.\\n\\n00:12:24.882 --> 00:12:28.230\\nI don\\'t know how long that ever\\nlast or what happened to it,\\n\\n00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.551\\nbut for me it was perfect\\nfor my learning style.\\n\\n00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:34.137\\nIt just seems like those\\nkinds of experiments\\n\\n00:12:34.137 --> 00:12:36.048\\nwere often very hard to\\ncome by when you\\'ve got\\n\\n00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:39.298\\nsuch disparate student\\nlevel of achievement.\\n\\n00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:40.138\\nSal: Yeah.\\n\\n00:12:40.138 --> 00:12:43.380\\nI think what you\\'re describing,\\nit\\'s not just for you.\\n\\n00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.635\\nI think almost any human being\\n\\n00:12:44.635 --> 00:12:46.138\\nwould say that is how\\nthey naturally learn.\\n\\n00:12:46.138 --> 00:12:48.633\\nIn the book, I talk about that\\nis how people naturally learn,\\n\\n00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:50.952\\nthrough activity, through personalization,\\n\\n00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:52.537\\nthrough interaction\\nwith other human beings.\\n\\n00:12:52.537 --> 00:12:55.036\\nWhat I think is special\\nabout this time in history\\n\\n00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:56.567\\nis that there are many\\nexperiments like the one\\n\\n00:12:56.567 --> 00:12:58.536\\nyou were a part of in your childhood.\\n\\n00:12:58.536 --> 00:12:59.779\\nThere are a lot of schools that are moving\\n\\n00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.279\\nin that direction, but\\nit\\'s not mainstream.\\n\\n00:13:01.279 --> 00:13:03.445\\nWhat we\\'re seeing now is\\nbecause of the technology,\\n\\n00:13:03.445 --> 00:13:05.635\\nbecause of this broad\\nadoption that things like\\n\\n00:13:05.635 --> 00:13:08.452\\nKhan Academy are seeing, it\\'s\\nstarting to be mainstream.\\n\\n00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:11.370\\nThe coordination is starting\\nto empower teachers to do that.\\n\\n00:13:11.370 --> 00:13:13.038\\nLarry: We still do group projects, too,\\n\\n00:13:13.038 --> 00:13:14.250\\nwhich I know your summer camp,\\n\\n00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.365\\nthat\\'s a big part of it, right?\\n\\n00:13:16.365 --> 00:13:17.137\\nSal: Right.\\n\\n00:13:17.137 --> 00:13:19.638\\nOne thing I talk a lot about\\nin the book is everyone\\'s\\n\\n00:13:19.638 --> 00:13:21.736\\nall paranoid about are we\\nfalling behind Estonia or\\n\\n00:13:21.736 --> 00:13:25.362\\nSouth Korea or Finland because\\nof our algebra test scores,\\n\\n00:13:25.362 --> 00:13:28.236\\nand it\\'s worth not being\\ncomplacent about that,\\n\\n00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:32.137\\nbut what I emphasize\\nis America is becoming\\n\\n00:13:32.137 --> 00:13:34.036\\nmore and more the center\\nof the world\\'s innovation,\\n\\n00:13:34.036 --> 00:13:36.336\\nand that\\'s because we have\\nthis culture of creativity.\\n\\n00:13:36.336 --> 00:13:38.638\\nFailure isn\\'t stigmatized.\\n\\n00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:40.538\\nWhat I see, instead of\\nmaking our Prussian model\\n\\n00:13:40.538 --> 00:13:42.737\\nmore like the one in\\nFinland or South Korea or\\n\\n00:13:42.737 --> 00:13:45.452\\nSingapore, let\\'s make ours more American,\\n\\n00:13:45.452 --> 00:13:47.365\\nwhere it\\'s more personalized, more time\\n\\n00:13:47.365 --> 00:13:49.870\\nwith other human beings,\\nand time for creativity.\\n\\n00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:50.946\\nCreativity is probably the single\\n\\n00:13:50.946 --> 00:13:53.452\\nmost important thing today,\\nbut our current model\\n\\n00:13:53.452 --> 00:13:55.947\\ncompletely squeezes time\\nfor it out of the equation.\\n\\n00:13:55.947 --> 00:13:58.236\\nLarry: Bill in Huntington\\nBeach, you\\'re on AirTalk.\\n\\n00:13:58.236 --> 00:13:59.290\\nBill: Hi.\\n\\n00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:04.037\\nI want to express my\\ngratitude for the Khan Academy\\n\\n00:14:04.037 --> 00:14:07.784\\nand all the tapes that are out there.\\n\\n00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:14.537\\nI\\'m a 55-year-old grad student,\\nreturning to civil engineering.\\n\\n00:14:14.537 --> 00:14:19.567\\nIt\\'s been 30 years since I first\\ntook calculus and I\\'d lost it all.\\n\\n00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.952\\nAnd so, I really literally\\nrelearned the subject\\n\\n00:14:22.952 --> 00:14:25.427\\nover the span of a few months.\\n\\n00:14:25.427 --> 00:14:28.565\\nThanks to Sal and his great tapes.\\n\\n00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:30.738\\nLarry: Wow; so not just kids?\\n\\n00:14:30.738 --> 00:14:31.738\\nSal: No.\\n\\n00:14:31.738 --> 00:14:32.951\\nWe see that in the data.\\n\\n00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:35.788\\nStories like that is what\\nkeep our whole team motivated.\\n\\n00:14:35.788 --> 00:14:38.536\\nLarry: Maurice in San Dimas, welcome.\\n\\n00:14:38.536 --> 00:14:40.135\\nMaurice: Hi, Larry.\\n\\n00:14:40.135 --> 00:14:42.447\\nMy wife is a teacher\\nin San Gabriel Valley,\\n\\n00:14:42.447 --> 00:14:45.788\\nteaching chemistry, and\\nshe loved the videos,\\n\\n00:14:45.788 --> 00:14:49.639\\nand actually uses it\\nas homework assignments\\n\\n00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:52.038\\nas a review, more than anything.\\n\\n00:14:52.038 --> 00:14:54.866\\nThe main problem that I see\\nis that the school district\\n\\n00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:56.837\\ndoesn\\'t let her actually play the videos\\n\\n00:14:56.837 --> 00:14:59.227\\nin the classroom because it\\'s on YouTube.\\n\\n00:14:59.227 --> 00:15:00.429\\nSal: Yeah.\\n\\n00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:03.777\\nThat\\'s a very real issue.\\n\\n00:15:03.777 --> 00:15:05.302\\nA lot of classrooms block YouTube.\\n\\n00:15:05.302 --> 00:15:07.016\\nSome countries block YouTube.\\n\\n00:15:07.016 --> 00:15:10.961\\nOn Khan Academy, there\\'s\\nlike a little link where\\n\\n00:15:10.961 --> 00:15:13.545\\nyou can acces it on mirrored\\nsites, some of the videos,\\n\\n00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:16.881\\nbut I think school districts are ...\\nand that\\'s a short term solution.\\n\\n00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:18.244\\nThe school districts\\nare starting to realize\\n\\n00:15:18.244 --> 00:15:20.045\\nthat YouTube does have educational value,\\n\\n00:15:20.045 --> 00:15:22.543\\nand YouTube is starting\\nto realize that as well.\\n\\n00:15:22.543 --> 00:15:24.964\\nI think collectively we\\'re\\nall working on solutions\\n\\n00:15:24.964 --> 00:15:26.545\\nto address exactly what you described.\\n\\n00:15:26.545 --> 00:15:28.047\\nLarry: Roxanne in West Lake Village\\n\\n00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:30.373\\nsays she\\'s a math tutor, refers students\\n\\n00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:31.962\\nto Khan Academy all the time.\\n\\n00:15:31.962 --> 00:15:34.460\\nThen parents ask, \"Why do\\nI need to hire tutors?\"\\n\\n00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.345\\nBut there\\'s still a great need because\\n\\n00:15:36.345 --> 00:15:38.373\\nkids need to practice the hands on,\\n\\n00:15:38.373 --> 00:15:40.243\\njust like when learning baseball.\\n\\n00:15:40.243 --> 00:15:42.043\\nSal: Once again, Khan\\nAcademy is not there to\\n\\n00:15:42.043 --> 00:15:43.845\\nreplace humans; it\\'s there\\nto supercharge humans.\\n\\n00:15:43.845 --> 00:15:46.435\\nAll of this started off as me\\nbeing a tutor, and it wasn\\'t\\n\\n00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:49.834\\nto replace myself, it was\\nreally to allow my ...\\n\\n00:15:49.834 --> 00:15:51.850\\nand get the half an hour\\nthat I had with Nadia\\n\\n00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:53.543\\nto be more constructive,\\nso I didn\\'t have to lecture\\n\\n00:15:53.543 --> 00:15:55.380\\nfor things for her and\\nshe didn\\'t have to be\\n\\n00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.243\\nembarassed to ask a\\nquestion from 4th grade.\\n\\n00:15:57.243 --> 00:15:58.446\\nShe could get it on demand.\\n\\n00:15:58.446 --> 00:16:00.544\\nAnd so, yeah, that\\'s what\\nyou\\'ve got to tell parents,\\n\\n00:16:00.544 --> 00:16:02.944\\nthat the tutor is now more valuable\\n\\n00:16:02.944 --> 00:16:04.648\\nand can take things to\\nanother level with students.\\n\\n00:16:04.648 --> 00:16:06.212\\nLarry: Jennifer in Fullerton,\\n\\n00:16:06.212 --> 00:16:09.446\\nwondering about translation\\nfor other countries.\\n\\n00:16:09.446 --> 00:16:11.172\\nYou\\'re looking at new videos to serve in\\n\\n00:16:11.172 --> 00:16:13.079\\nother languages or dubbing yourself?\\n\\n00:16:13.079 --> 00:16:15.613\\nSal: We actually have a\\nfairly extensive project.\\n\\n00:16:15.613 --> 00:16:19.447\\nWe\\'ve translated and\\nredone 7,000 videos into\\n\\n00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:21.843\\nother languages, the 12\\nmajor languages of the world.\\n\\n00:16:21.843 --> 00:16:24.090\\nIf you go to the bottom of the\\nsite, you see a little drop down.\\n\\n00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:25.590\\nWe have actually 1,000 in Spanish,\\n\\n00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.127\\n1,000 in Portuguese,\\nand a bunch of others.\\n\\n00:16:27.127 --> 00:16:27.448\\nLarry: Wow.\\n\\n00:16:27.448 --> 00:16:28.739\\nJonathan in Long Beach says,\\n\\n00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:31.662\\n\"The technology really\\nstreamlined the college system.\"\\n\\n00:16:31.662 --> 00:16:33.844\\nHe\\'s a student at Long Beach City College.\\n\\n00:16:33.844 --> 00:16:35.537\\nHe says, \"Lectures go on and on,\\n\\n00:16:35.537 -->

I'm here\\nwith Doctor Laurence\\n\\n00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:03.540\\nBaker from Stanford\\nMedical School,\\n\\n00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.950\\nand we're going to talk about\\nhealth care costs, or health\\n\\n00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.670\\ncare economics, which\\nyou're an expert in.\\n\\n00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.253\\nLAURENCE BAKER: I like to spend\\na lot of time thinking about--\\n\\n00:00:12.253 --> 00:00:13.850\\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\\n\\n00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.520\\nSALMAN KHAN: So all\\nof these charts,\\n\\n00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.700\\nwhich all seem to have\\na similar shape here,\\n\\n00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.550\\nthese are, essentially,\\nmeasures of how much\\n\\n00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.971\\nwe're spending on health care.\\n\\n00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.720\\nSo this first one right\\nhere, what's this?\\n\\n00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.065\\nTotal health spending 1960-2009.\\n\\n00:00:26.065 --> 00:00:27.520\\nAnd it says, United States.\\n\\n00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.570\\nLAURENCE BAKER: This\\nis the United States.\\n\\n00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.819\\nThis is data that's compiled\\nby the federal government\\n\\n00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:33.180\\nevery year since, well,\\n1960 and this figure is--\\n\\n00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.359\\nSALMAN KHAN: And this isn't\\nadjusted for inflation.\\n\\n00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:37.400\\nLAURENCE BAKER: That's\\nnot adjusted for anything.\\n\\n00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.722\\nThat's the total dollar\\nvalue that the folks\\n\\n00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.180\\nin the federal government who\\nlike to calculate this number\\n\\n00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.670\\nhave come up with\\nfor the amount we\\n\\n00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.444\\nspend on health care in a year.\\n\\n00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.110\\nSALMAN KHAN: OK.\\n\\n00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.570\\nSo someone looking just at\\nthis data point might say, OK.\\n\\n00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.360\\nMaybe it's not\\ninflation-adjusted.\\n\\n00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.540\\nMaybe the inflation curve is\\nalso growing at some rate here.\\n\\n00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.130\\nBut the absolute numbers\\ndo seem to be large.\\n\\n00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.460\\nBy 2009, I guess it's\\nalready-- well, 2009.\\n\\n00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.340\\nWe're already several\\nyears passed that.\\n\\n00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.980\\ntwo and a half\\ntrillion dollars just\\n\\n00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.500\\nto get people clear to\\nwhat we're talking about.\\n\\n00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.410\\nThis is in billions.\\n\\n00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.750\\nThis is 2,486 billion.\\n\\n00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.520\\nSo that's $2.4\\ntrillion, and then\\n\\n00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.390\\nthat's predicted to\\nalmost double by 2019.\\n\\n00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.770\\nAnd our GDP is on the\\norder of $15 trillion.\\n\\n00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.310\\nSo it's a significant chunk\\nof everything that we produce.\\n\\n00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.810\\nLAURENCE BAKER: That's a big\\nchunk of everything we produce.\\n\\n00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.721\\nYeah, going up rapidly.\\n\\n00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:30.720\\nHard to predict a little\\nbit, but all the trends\\n\\n00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.370\\nare up and so we're\\nworried about--\\n\\n00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.060\\nSALMAN KHAN: And this is\\non a per capita basis.\\n\\n00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.559\\nSo I guess there's\\ntwo ways to think\\n\\n00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:37.190\\nabout why costs are going up.\\n\\n00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.030\\nOne is that maybe we just\\nhave a lot more people\\n\\n00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.610\\nor, that on a per person\\nbasis, we are spending more.\\n\\n00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.740\\nAnd this chart seems\\nto imply the latter.\\n\\n00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.050\\nLAURENCE BAKER: This says,\\non a per person basis,\\n\\n00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.883\\nwe're spending more.\\n\\n00:01:48.883 --> 00:01:51.300\\nStill not inflation\\nadjusted in this chart.\\n\\n00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.173\\nBut going from\\n$100 or so in 1960\\n\\n00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:58.450\\nto $8,000 in the last\\ncouple of years--\\n\\n00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.260\\nand you can see the trend\\nsince, say, 2005 in there.\\n\\n00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.890\\nIt's up and it's up\\npretty steeply just\\n\\n00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.020\\nin the last little bit.\\n\\n00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.130\\nAnd headed for maybe\\n$13,000 or $14,000.\\n\\n00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.463\\nSALMAN KHAN: $13,000 or $14,000.\\n\\n00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:11.030\\nThat's a nice sub-compact\\ncar one could buy.\\n\\n00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.800\\nNot to say what's\\nmore important.\\n\\n00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.564\\nAnd so this next\\nchart right over here\\n\\n00:02:14.564 --> 00:02:16.730\\nis actually that calculation\\nas a percentage of GDP.\\n\\n00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.330\\nAnd, to me, this is, maybe, one\\nof the most relevant things,\\n\\n00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.310\\nbecause that\\nadjusted for things.\\n\\n00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.090\\nIt doesn't directly\\nadjust for inflation\\n\\n00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.870\\nbut it says, as a percentage of\\nall of the goods and services\\n\\n00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.162\\nas an economy that we are\\ndoing, this is a percentage.\\n\\n00:02:31.162 --> 00:02:32.870\\nSo this is an interesting\\none right here.\\n\\n00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.680\\nSo in 1960, roughly\\n5% of everything\\n\\n00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.310\\nthat all the goods and\\nservices Americans produced,\\n\\n00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.690\\n1 in 20 of that,\\nof our energies,\\n\\n00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.610\\nwas spent towards health care.\\n\\n00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.890\\nAnd now it's looking like,\\nin the next few years,\\n\\n00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.500\\nit's going to be\\napproaching 20%.\\n\\n00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.230\\nIt's already in the upper teens.\\n\\n00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.040\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, its past\\n15%, 16%, and we're headed up.\\n\\n00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.597\\nThe last year or so, maybe,\\nit was a little slower growth,\\n\\n00:02:57.597 --> 00:03:00.180\\nbut you can see the trend over\\nthe last decade or two decades.\\n\\n00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.700\\nIt's up up and up.\\n\\n00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.080\\nSo you're right.\\n\\n00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.850\\nWhen health\\neconomists, when people\\n\\n00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.924\\nwho think about\\nthis more deeply,\\n\\n00:03:06.924 --> 00:03:08.590\\nwant to think about\\nhealth care spending\\n\\n00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.000\\ntwo and a half trillion\\nis an interesting number.\\n\\n00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.291\\n8,000 is an interesting number.\\n\\n00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.000\\nBut this one captures\\npopulation growth\\n\\n00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.880\\nto a large extent,\\ncaptures inflation.\\n\\n00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.210\\nAnd the fact that we're\\nspending one seventh, roughly,\\n\\n00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.920\\nof our productive capacity on\\nhealth care is interesting--\\n\\n00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.700\\nSALMAN KHAN: And closely\\napproaching-- actually, it's\\n\\n00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.241\\nalready one sixth\\nand approaching one\\n\\n00:03:24.241 --> 00:03:28.860\\nfifth of everything that\\nwe do is about health care.\\n\\n00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.570\\nAnd I guess there's a\\ncouple of things there.\\n\\n00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.720\\nMaybe we're getting healthier,\\nI guess, is one possibility.\\n\\n00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.399\\nOr maybe we aren't and\\nthen something is weird.\\n\\n00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.940\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Well, that's\\nthe really interesting question.\\n\\n00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.440\\nWe can think about\\nwhy this is going up,\\n\\n00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.815\\nbut at the end of\\nthe day, you're\\n\\n00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:44.320\\nhappy if we're\\nspending this much\\n\\n00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.440\\nand if we're spending\\nmore than other countries,\\n\\n00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.020\\nwe're spending more\\nthan we did last year,\\n\\n00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.710\\nif we're getting\\nhealthier because of it\\n\\n00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.035\\nor if we're getting happier.\\n\\n00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:53.160\\nInteresting question if we\\nwant to count happiness.\\n\\n00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.576\\nIt doesn't make us healthy,\\nbut if we're getting something\\n\\n00:03:55.576 --> 00:03:57.952\\nwe value, and we're getting\\nworried, and we get worried--\\n\\n00:03:57.952 --> 00:03:59.867\\nSALMAN KHAN: There are\\nmany forms of happiness\\n\\n00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:01.090\\nthat do not make you healthy.\\n\\n00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.327\\n[LAUGHTER]\\n\\n00:04:02.327 --> 00:04:03.910\\nLAURENCE BAKER: At\\nthe end of the day,\\n\\n00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.190\\nthis may be our\\nbiggest question.\\n\\n00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.710\\nSALMAN KHAN: Some will act\\ndirectly against your health.\\n\\n00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.426\\nAnd that goes straight\\ninto this chart\\n\\n00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:13.550\\nwhich you're talking about.\\n\\n00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.240\\nMaybe we should or maybe we\\nshouldn't compare ourselves\\n\\n00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.275\\nto other countries.\\n\\n00:04:17.275 --> 00:04:19.399\\nAnd this is comparing\\nourselves to other countries.\\n\\n00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.648\\nSo this chart right over here.\\n\\n00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:22.050\\nThis is the blue graph.\\n\\n00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.807\\nSo we are this light\\nblue [INAUDIBLE] same.\\n\\n00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:25.390\\nSo this is us.\\n\\n00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.150\\nThis is the United\\nStates right over here.\\n\\n00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.580\\nThat is us, the United States.\\n\\n00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.740\\nAnd if we compare to other\\ndeveloped countries with,\\n\\n00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.270\\nI guess, not too\\ndifferent demographics--\\n\\n00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.520\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, the\\noverall developed countries,\\n\\n00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:38.978\\nindustrialized\\ncountries, countries\\n\\n00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:42.110\\nwhere the standard of living\\nis in pretty good shape.\\n\\n00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.990\\nSALMAN KHAN: They have a\\nbroad-- it's not a homogeneous--\\n\\n00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.698\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Not\\nentirely homogeneous.\\n\\n00:04:46.698 --> 00:04:49.240\\nSome people will argue the\\nUS is more diverse than--\\n\\n00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.090\\nSALMAN KHAN: The United\\nKingdom is quite--\\n\\n00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.850\\nLAURENCE BAKER: --pretty\\ndiverse countries, generally.\\n\\n00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.350\\nCertainly countries\\nwith immigration\\n\\n00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.492\\nissues that the US has,\\ncountries with lower income\\n\\n00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:58.450\\nand higher income\\npopulations that the US does.\\n\\n00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:59.533\\nSo they're pretty diverse.\\n\\n00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.750\\nSALMAN KHAN: Right, I mean,\\nwhen you look at this,\\n\\n00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.150\\nmaybe this is the\\nreal chart to look at,\\n\\n00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.000\\nbecause this is the\\npercentage of GDP\\n\\n00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.330\\nbut also puts it in\\ncontext of other countries.\\n\\n00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.170\\nAnd that's where they're all\\nkind of bundled around in this,\\n\\n00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:13.540\\nI don't know, the low end.\\n\\n00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.665\\nWhat is this, actually,\\nthe UK-- I didn't realize--\\n\\n00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:18.270\\nis actually at the low end\\nas a percentage of GDP.\\n\\n00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.505\\nAnd France is at\\nthe high end of GDP.\\n\\n00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:23.630\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, so\\nI've done a little picking\\n\\n00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:25.080\\nand choosing of the\\nEuropean countries.\\n\\n00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.996\\nYeah, there are some\\nthat are a little higher,\\n\\n00:05:26.996 --> 00:05:28.692\\nbut nobody comes\\nclose to the US.\\n\\n00:05:28.692 --> 00:05:29.650\\nThese are the big ones.\\n\\n00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.850\\nUK is the lowest in\\nthe world, really,\\n\\n00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.600\\nof the developed countries,\\nthe European countries.\\n\\n00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.230\\nAnd France, Germany,\\nCanada, are commonly\\n\\n00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.250\\ncompared to the\\nUS at 10% or 11%.\\n\\n00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.060\\nSo we're 50% higher,\\n60% higher than those\\n\\n00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.249\\ndouble what's\\ngoing on in the UK.\\n\\n00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:47.290\\nSALMAN KHAN: And do we\\nknow why we're doing this?\\n\\n00:05:49.747 --> 00:05:50.580\\nWhere is that going?\\n\\n00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.130\\nWhere are we spending money that\\nthese other countries aren't?\\n\\n00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.550\\nLAURENCE BAKER:\\nRight, so two places.\\n\\n00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.091\\nUltimately, the\\neconomics of it would\\n\\n00:05:56.091 --> 00:05:58.795\\nsay, if you're spending\\nmore than somebody else, how\\n\\n00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:01.170\\nmuch stuff you buying, what\\nkind of things you're buying,\\n\\n00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.390\\nand then the price that\\nyou're paying per thing.\\n\\n00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:07.170\\nSo we're talking either\\nabout prices or quantities.\\n\\n00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:08.540\\nSo it's a little bit of both.\\n\\n00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.350\\nIf you compare us\\nacross countries,\\n\\n00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.700\\nwe buy more of some\\nkinds of services\\n\\n00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:16.210\\nthan other countries buy.\\n\\n00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:18.427\\nThere's some interesting\\ncomparisons--\\n\\n00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:20.510\\nSALMAN KHAN: So we might\\nget more MRI's per person\\n\\n00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:21.500\\nor something like that.\\n\\n00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.780\\nLAURENCE BAKER: We certainly\\ndo get more MRI's per person.\\n\\n00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.490\\nIt's interesting.\\n\\n00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.960\\nIt's not that we have more\\ndoctors per capita, say,\\n\\n00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.660\\nor more hospital\\nbeds per capita.\\n\\n00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.140\\nIt's not that we get more\\nprimary care visits in the US.\\n\\n00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.490\\nIt's actually true that,\\nin many European countries,\\n\\n00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.262\\nyou get more primary\\ncare visits, more\\n\\n00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:37.636\\ntime with your primary care\\ndoctor then we get in the US.\\n\\n00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:40.920\\nBut if you were\\npicking a poster child,\\n\\n00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.450\\nit might be the MRI or\\nsomething more sophisticated,\\n\\n00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.130\\nsomething more expensive,\\nspecialists visits,\\n\\n00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.670\\nlots of tests, and\\nthings like that,\\n\\n00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.450\\nthat we buy in the United States\\nthat they don't buy in Europe.\\n\\n00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.320\\nAnd that drives up\\nour health care costs.\\n\\n00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:56.290\\nSALMAN KHAN: So we\\ndefinitely are buying more\\n\\n00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.059\\nand it's costing us more for--\\n\\n00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.600\\nLAURENCE BAKER: And\\nthe price is also\\n\\n00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.967\\ndifferent in the United States.\\n\\n00:07:00.967 --> 00:07:03.050\\nThere's some people who\\nhave done studies of this.\\n\\n00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.390\\nThere's always\\nlittle bits of debate\\n\\n00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.240\\nabout how you define\\nthese prices exactly,\\n\\n00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.977\\nbut we pay doctors--\\nif you're finding\\n\\n00:07:09.977 --> 00:07:11.560\\ndoctors' annual\\nincomes, they're going\\n\\n00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.660\\nto be higher in\\nthe United States.\\n\\n00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.868\\nThat is to say, we're paying,\\nin some sense, a higher\\n\\n00:07:14.868 --> 00:07:17.540\\nprice for a year of work from a\\ndoctor than they pay in Europe.\\n\\n00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.920\\nWe're paying a higher price for\\nour hospital administration,\\n\\n00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.140\\nfor our staff in the hospitals,\\nthings we tend to pay more.\\n\\n00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:26.970\\nSo we buy more things.\\n\\n00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.040\\nWe tend to buy more of\\nthe more expensive things.\\n\\n00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.614\\nAnd we tend to pay\\na higher price.\\n\\n00:07:30.614 --> 00:07:32.030\\nSALMAN KHAN: Do\\nyou know, roughly,\\n\\n00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.100\\nhow much of the\\nhealth care dollar\\n\\n00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.060\\ngoes towards salaries\\nversus drugs versus things\\n\\n00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:42.470\\nlike MRI's and the kind of fixed\\ncosts like MRI's and hospital\\n\\n00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.620\\nbeds and things like that?\\n\\n00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.995\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Yeah, so some\\nof this you can figure out.\\n\\n00:07:45.995 --> 00:07:49.770\\nWe could almost put another\\nslide up on there on the screen\\n\\n00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:51.265\\nthere.\\n\\n00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:53.620\\nThe US health accounts\\nwill tell you something\\n\\n00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.880\\nlike doctors and hospitals\\nand drugs-- drugs, 10% or 15%,\\n\\n00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.190\\na little less than that.\\n\\n00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:02.070\\nI would have to go back and\\nlook at the data on physicians.\\n\\n00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:09.160\\nBut physicians-- let's say that\\nhospitals and physicians are\\n\\n00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.810\\n20% or 30%-- I hesitate to\\ngive you look the number.\\n\\n00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:15.960\\nSALMAN KHAN: It's not 90%\\n\\n00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.930\\nLAURENCE BAKER: It's not 90%.\\n\\n00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.070\\nSALMAN KHAN: When\\nwe say hospitals--\\n\\n00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.180\\nso that includes\\noutpatient and inpatient?\\n\\n00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:22.260\\nLAURENCE BAKER:\\nYeah, so there's lots\\n\\n00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.140\\nof ways these health\\naccounts get broken up,\\n\\n00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:29.730\\nphysicians, hospitals, emergency\\ndepartments, different kinds\\n\\n00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.360\\nof equipment and things that\\nget purchased, there's research\\n\\n00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.919\\nand there's buildings,\\nand all that--\\n\\n00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.150\\nSALMAN KHAN: So just\\n[INAUDIBLE] none of these things\\n\\n00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.314\\ndo make up the bulk of it.\\n\\n00:08:37.314 --> 00:08:38.730\\nWe had a video\\nabout drug pricing,\\n\\n00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.659\\nbut drug pricing by\\nitself is not the reason\\n\\n00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.840\\nwhy we're out here.\\n\\n00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.780\\nAnd physician pay by\\nitself is not the reason\\n\\n00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.070\\nwhy we're out there.\\n\\n00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.910\\nAll of these are contributing.\\n\\n00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.066\\nAll of these we're getting\\nmore of and we're paying for.\\n\\n00:08:53.066 --> 00:08:54.190\\nLAURENCE BAKER: It's a mix.\\n\\n00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:54.970\\nAt the end of the\\nday, it's going\\n\\n00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.290\\nto be a bunch of things like\\nthis all thrown together.\\n\\n00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:58.540\\nWe buy more stuff.\\n\\n00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.180\\nWe tend to buy more\\nexpensive stuff.\\n\\n00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.150\\nWe buy it from people\\nwho we pay a lot.\\n\\n00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:03.420\\nWe buy more specialist visits.\\n\\n00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:05.240\\nFor example, in the\\nUS, we pay specialists\\n\\n00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.160\\na higher annual salary\\nthan we pay generalists,\\n\\n00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.840\\nand that comes\\nout in the prices.\\n\\n00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:11.200\\nSALMAN KHAN: They don't\\ndo that in Europe?\\n\\n00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.120\\nLAURENCE BAKER:\\nEurope does pay more,\\n\\n00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.790\\nbut everybody is shifted down.\\n\\n00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:15.364\\nAll the physicians\\nare shifted down.\\n\\n00:09:15.364 --> 00:09:17.030\\nAnd I think the\\nspecialists are probably\\n\\n00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.010\\nshifted down more in Europe\\nthan the generalists are.\\n\\n00:09:21.010 --> 00:09:22.930\\nWe pay more for our\\nprescription drugs here.\\n\\n00:09:22.930 --> 00:09:24.050\\nWe pay more for--\\n\\n00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:25.591\\nSALMAN KHAN: Now,\\nwhat are we getting\\n\\n00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.716\\nin terms-- other than more\\nMercedes in the doctors'\\n\\n00:09:27.716 --> 00:09:28.257\\nparking lots.\\n\\n00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:28.920\\nI'm kidding.\\n\\n00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:29.775\\nI'm kidding.\\n\\n00:09:29.775 --> 00:09:33.260\\nAlthough, you do\\nsee a lot of those.\\n\\n00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.030\\nIt seems to be the car of\\nchoice when I visit the doctor.\\n\\n00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:41.167\\nAnd my wife's a physician.\\n\\n00:09:41.167 --> 00:09:43.000\\nObviously we all work\\nwith many, so, they've\\n\\n00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.020\\nworked very hard\\nso, I'm not going\\n\\n00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:49.247\\nto make any statement about\\nthey're underpaid or overpaid,\\n\\n00:09:49.247 --> 00:09:51.580\\nespecially relative to some\\npeople I knew in the finance\\n\\n00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.360\\nworld, I would say that\\nthey're definitely underpaid.\\n\\n00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.200\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Possibly, yes.\\n\\n00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:54.908\\nSALMAN KHAN: Yes.\\n\\n00:09:54.908 --> 00:09:58.150\\nThey're above Mercedes\\nin that world.\\n\\n00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:00.800\\nAnd so are we getting\\nanything in exchange for this?\\n\\n00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.117\\nAre we getting less wait times?\\n\\n00:10:03.117 --> 00:10:04.950\\nAre we getting better\\naccess to our doctors?\\n\\n00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.030\\nWhat are we getting or\\nwhat do we know about that?\\n\\n00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.863\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Well,\\nso this is the debate.\\n\\n00:10:08.863 --> 00:10:11.260\\nThis is in, maybe, a microcosm\\none of the big debates\\n\\n00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.640\\nwe're having in\\nthe US right now.\\n\\n00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.830\\nWe're spending more every year.\\n\\n00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:15.538\\nWe're spending more\\nthan other countries.\\n\\n00:10:15.538 --> 00:10:18.197\\nIf it was clear we were twice\\nas well off, twice as happy--\\n\\n00:10:18.197 --> 00:10:19.780\\nSALMAN KHAN: And\\nwe're growing faster.\\n\\n00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.920\\nLAURENCE BAKER: And\\nwe're growing-- yes, it\\n\\n00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.503\\ndepends on how you\\nlook at the timing,\\n\\n00:10:22.503 --> 00:10:24.870\\nbut we're growing a little\\nfaster in some years.\\n\\n00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.340\\nOur health care costs go up 10%.\\n\\n00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.580\\nIf we knew we were 10% happier\\nthis year with our health care\\n\\n00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:29.730\\nsystem, we would be happy.\\n\\n00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.950\\nAnd that's the big debate.\\n\\n00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.614\\nThere are some cases\\nwhere the US-- there\\n\\n00:10:34.614 --> 00:10:35.780\\nare things you can point to.\\n\\n00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.790\\nWe have fewer waiting\\nlines for some services,\\n\\n00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:40.260\\nand some of the\\ncountries that keep\\n\\n00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.769\\nthe costs down have more lines.\\n\\n00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:44.310\\nIt's also not the\\ncase that they have\\n\\n00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.430\\nwaiting lines for everything\\nand the really serious stuff\\n\\n00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.230\\ndoesn't tend to have\\nlong waiting lines.\\n\\n00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.390\\nWe get easier access to some\\nof the high tech stuff, which\\n\\n00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:54.390\\nwe like it, and so that\\ndrives up our spending\\n\\n00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.159\\nbut maybe makes us happy.\\n\\n00:10:56.159 --> 00:10:58.450\\nSALMAN KHAN: It may or may\\nnot lead to better outcomes.\\n\\n00:10:58.450 --> 00:10:59.825\\nSo it makes us\\nhappy that we feel\\n\\n00:10:59.825 --> 00:11:02.300\\nlike we're getting\\nbetter customer service.\\n\\n00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.505\\nInstead of waiting three\\nmonths for a procedure,\\n\\n00:11:03.505 --> 00:11:06.046\\nwe're getting it in three weeks,\\nwhich would make me happier.\\n\\n00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:08.560\\nI mean, objectively, I would\\nbe much happier about that.\\n\\n00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.140\\nBut what happens when we\\nlook at the overall outcomes?\\n\\n00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.700\\nLife expectancy, and people\\ndying from heart disease,\\n\\n00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.267\\nor whatever?\\n\\n00:11:17.267 --> 00:11:19.100\\nLAURENCE BAKER: This\\nis kind of a mixed bag.\\n\\n00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.370\\nSome of the most\\ncommonly cited figures\\n\\n00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.200\\nare cases where\\nthe US doesn't do\\n\\n00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.727\\nas well as some\\nEuropean countries.\\n\\n00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:28.310\\nWe spend a lot more and we don't\\ndo better on life expectancy.\\n\\n00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.260\\nWe don't do better\\nan infant mortality.\\n\\n00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.720\\nThere are some cases where\\nthe US does really well,\\n\\n00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.174\\nespecially things where\\naccess to the high end stuff\\n\\n00:11:36.174 --> 00:11:37.090\\ncan make a difference.\\n\\n00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:38.673\\nAnd so there are\\nsome situations where\\n\\n00:11:38.673 --> 00:11:41.545\\nit looks like we buy the kinds\\nof things that are really\\n\\n00:11:41.545 --> 00:11:42.670\\ngoing to make us healthier.\\n\\n00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.670\\nBut it's not across the board.\\n\\n00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.310\\nAnd some of the really\\ninteresting ones\\n\\n00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.500\\nare cases where there's\\nfairly inexpensive stuff\\n\\n00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.300\\nthat looks like it would work\\nwell and improve outcomes,\\n\\n00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.959\\nand sometimes we're not\\ndoing the inexpensive stuff\\n\\n00:11:53.959 --> 00:11:55.250\\nthat other countries are doing.\\n\\n00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.290\\nAnd it's coming out\\nto maybe hurt us.\\n\\n00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.180\\nWe wouldn't be having the debate\\nif we were clearly better off,\\n\\n00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.680\\nbut it's really the case that,\\nin only some of the measures,\\n\\n00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.670\\ndo we end up better off.\\n\\n00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.336\\nWe don't always\\nvaccinate our kids more.\\n\\n00:12:07.336 --> 00:12:09.040\\nWe don't always get\\npeople screened more\\n\\n00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.680\\nfor cancers and\\nthings like that.\\n\\n00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.200\\nBut sometimes we do.\\n\\n00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.170\\nSo there are success\\nstories here.\\n\\n00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:15.830\\nSALMAN KHAN: Now,\\none thing that's\\n\\n00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.470\\ninteresting about looking\\nat this chart a little bit\\n\\n00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.720\\ndeeper is that it doesn't\\nlook like this is something\\n\\n00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.594\\nthat, you know, since\\nthe American Revolution\\n\\n00:12:21.594 --> 00:12:24.117\\nthat we've been spending\\ndouble as a percentage of GDP\\n\\n00:12:24.117 --> 00:12:25.200\\nrelative to everyone else.\\n\\n00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.210\\nI mean if I just look at\\nthis chart right here,\\n\\n00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:30.110\\nit seems like us and\\nCanada, we were right along\\n\\n00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.180\\nvery similar to each other\\nto about the early '70s.\\n\\n00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.405\\nAnd then we're still\\nin kind of that pack\\n\\n00:12:35.405 --> 00:12:37.210\\nwith Germany and France.\\n\\n00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.680\\nI guess, relative to the\\nUK, we actually always\\n\\n00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.570\\nhave been higher.\\n\\n00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:43.010\\nBut then right around\\nthis time period,\\n\\n00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:45.190\\nthe late '70s,\\nearly '80s-- that's\\n\\n00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.290\\nwhere we really\\nstarted to break off.\\n\\n00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:49.240\\nWas there some\\npolicy shift there?\\n\\n00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.730\\nLAURENCE BAKER: So there's not\\na tangible, specific policy\\n\\n00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:52.230\\nshift.\\n\\n00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:55.080\\nWhat starts happening in the\\nUS there is we start adopting\\n\\n00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.442\\nand we start shifting toward\\nthe higher-end stuff more.\\n\\n00:12:57.442 --> 00:12:58.650\\nAnd some of that's the part--\\n\\n00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:00.649\\nSALMAN KHAN: That's where\\nthe technology started\\n\\n00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:01.390\\nto really get--\\n\\n00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.390\\nLAURENCE BAKER: I think\\nthat's mainly the story.\\n\\n00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:06.450\\nWe started to\\nreally-- the research\\n\\n00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:09.040\\nin things, the development that\\nwent on in the world, really\\n\\n00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.500\\nfrom 1940, '50, '60, started\\nto produce the capacity\\n\\n00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.430\\nto do new and expensive things.\\n\\n00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.060\\nAnd the US grabbed those and\\nother countries in the world\\n\\n00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.325\\nwere less quick to\\ngrab them, maybe,\\n\\n00:13:19.325 --> 00:13:20.450\\nyou would say more careful.\\n\\n00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:22.560\\nMaybe you would say\\ntoo careful, too slow.\\n\\n00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.450\\nBut the US, as you see\\nthere, really quickly started\\n\\n00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.550\\nto put up specialized\\nhospitals, started\\n\\n00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.930\\nto buy the fancy\\nequipment, and you\\n\\n00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.960\\ncan see what kind\\nof came out of it.\\n\\n00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.070\\nSALMAN KHAN: And to some degree,\\nprobably, the whole world\\n\\n00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:36.490\\nbenefited from that because\\nyou're going back to the drug\\n\\n00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.210\\npricing or the MRI manufacturers\\nwere able to get those returns\\n\\n00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.710\\nand, hopefully,\\nmuch of that they're\\n\\n00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.370\\nable to reinvest and not spend\\ntoo much on other things.\\n\\n00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.850\\nBut it is fueling--\\n\\n00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.909\\nLAURENCE BAKER: Yeah,\\nthe innovation-- there's\\n\\n00:13:49.909 --> 00:13:52.200\\nalways these kinds of questions\\nthat swirl around here.\\n\\n00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.480\\nIf the US pays a lot\\nof money and that\\n\\n00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.813\\ncomes back into innovation\\nthen everybody benefits from,\\n\\n00:13:55.813 --> 00:13:57.854\\nincluding us, maybe it's OK.\\n\\n00:13:57.854 --> 00:13:59.770\\nI think there are people\\nwho debate whether we\\n\\n00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.970\\ngot enough innovation,\\nenough benefits that's\\n\\n00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:05.960\\ntangibly related to our spending\\nto make our spending worth it,\\n\\n00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.230\\nbut there are some cases\\nwhere that probably happened.\\n\\n00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.490\\nAnd so there's some\\nsubtlety to the question.\\n\\n00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.030\\nI always say, if\\nyou're the Yankees\\n\\n00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:16.460\\nand you're going to pay the\\nhuge amount for the big payroll\\n\\n00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.570\\nand the big stars, people\\nexpect you to win every time.\\n\\n00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:20.890\\nAnd that's the US's challenge.\\n\\n00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:21.930\\nIf we're going to\\npay the big bucks--\\n\\n00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:22.820\\nSALMAN KHAN:

      "{'prompt': \"webvtt kind captions language en - instructor we are told, a large nationwide poll recently showed an unemployment rate of 9 in the united states. the mayor of a local town wonders if this national result holds true for her town, so she plans on taking a sample of her residents to see if the unemployment rate is significantly different than 9 in her town. let p represent the unemployment rate in her town. here are the hypotheses she'll use. so, her null hypothesis is that, hey, the unemployment rate in her town is the same as for the country, and her alternative hypothesis is that it is not the same. under which of the following conditions would the mayor commit a type i error? so, pause this video, and see if you can figure it out on your own. now, let's work through this together, so let's just remind ourselves what a type i error even is. this is a situation where we reject the null hypothesis, even though it is true. reject null hypothesis, even though, even though our null hypothesis is true. and in general, if you're committing either a type i or a type ii error, you're doing the wrong thing, you're doing something that somehow contradicts reality, even though you didn't intend to. and so, in this case, that would be rejecting the hypothesis that the unemployment rate is 9 in this town, even though it actually is 9 in this town, so let's see which of these choices match up to that. she concludes the town's unemployment rate is not 9 when it actually is. yeah, in this situation, in order to conclude that the unemployment rate is not 9, she would have to reject the null hypothesis, even though the null hypothesis is actually true, even though the unemployment rate actually is 9. so, i'm liking this choice, but let's read the other ones, just to make sure. she concludes the town's unemployment rate is not 9 when it actually is not. well, this wouldn't be an error. if the null hypothesis isn't true, it's not a problem to reject it, so this one wouldn't be an error. she concludes the town's unemployment rate is 9 when it actually is. well, once again, this would not be an error. this would be failing to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is actually true, not an error. choice d, she concludes the town's unemployment rate is 9 when it actually is not. so, this is a situation where she fails to reject the null hypothesis, even though the null hypothesis is not true, so this one right over here, this one would actually be, this is an error. this is an error, but this is a type ii error. so, one way to think about it, first you say, okay, am i making an error? am i rejecting something that's true, or am i failing to reject something that's false? and the rejecting something that is true, that's type i, and failing to reject something that is false, that is type ii. and so, with that in mind, let's do another example. a large university is curious if they should build another cafeteria. they plan to survey a sample of their students to see if there is strong evidence that the proportion interested in a meal plan is higher than 40, in which case they will consider building a new cafeteria. let p represent the proportion of students interested in a meal plan. here are the hypotheses they'll use. so, the null hypothesis is that 40 or fewer of the students are interested in a meal plan, while the alternative hypothesis is that more than 40 are interested. what would be the consequence of a type ii error in this context? so, once again, pause this video and try to answer this for yourself. okay, now let's do it together. let's just remind ourselves what a type ii error is, we just talked about it. so, failing, failing to reject, in this case, our null hypothesis, even though it is false. so, this would be a scenario where this is false, which would mean that more than 40 actually do want a meal plan, but you fail to reject this. so, what would happen is, is that you wouldn't build another cafeteria 'cause you'd say, hey, no, there's not that many people who are interested in the meal plan, but you wouldn't, but, actually there are a lot of people who are interested in the meal plan, and so you probably wouldn't have enough cafeteria space. and so, this says, they don't consider building a new cafeteria when they should. yeah, this is exactly right. they don't consider building a new cafeteria when they shouldn't. well, this would just be a correct conclusion. they consider building a new cafeteria when they shouldn't, and so, this is a scenario where they do reject the null hypothesis, even though the null hypothesis is true, so this right over here would be a type i error. type i error. because if they're considering building a new cafeteria, that means they rejected the null hypothesis, even when they shouldn't. that means that the null hypothesis was true, so type i. they consider building a new cafeteria when they should. well, once again, this wouldn't be an error at all, this would be a correct conclusion. this one and this one are correct conclusions. a and c are the consequences of a type ii and a type i error, respectively.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",
      "{'prompt': 'it is a signal honour for me to address this body and to extend to the president on behalf of the government and people of the republic of trinidad and tobago congratulations on his election as president of the general assembly at its seventieth session. we also express our appreciation to his predecessor, his excellency mr. sam kutesa of uganda, for the many productive initiatives that he pursued to good effect during his tenure. the president has assumed the mantle of leadership of this body at a critical juncture in the life of the organization. now is an opportune moment to reaffirm its founders guiding vision as enshrined in the charter of the united nations and to rededicate ourselves to be faithful in our joint pursuit of the goals of peace, security, development and human rights. but, as we assess the performance and impact of the united nations, we must also look ahead to the next phase in the life of this unique organization, given the many challenges that confront human civilization in general and the international community in particular. consequently, trinidad and tobago considers the theme of this session the united nations at 70 the road ahead for peace, security and human rights to be both most fitting and timely. a few days ago in this very hall, member states adopted the 2030 agenda for sustainable development, the overarching framework that will guide global development for the next 15 years. trinidad and tobago echoes the words of the secretary-general that the 2030 agenda encompasses a universal, transformative and integrated agenda that heralds a historic turning point for our world. the adoption of this landmark agreement is testament to the triumph, and indeed the power and possibilities, of multilateralism, especially as it emphasizes a peoples agenda, with the promise of leaving no one behind. this ambitious and inclusive agenda must not be lost in lofty rhetoric. 15-29822 2329 a70pv.26 02102015 the united nations has as its main purposes to maintain international peace and security, to promote and protect human rights and to effectively address pressing international economic and social issues, such as development, through international cooperation. although in the aftermath of the second world war the united nations has succeeded in preventing another global war, peace still remains elusive in some parts of the world. conflicts and tensions adversely affect countries and regions well beyond their immediate place of origin, whether through forced migration, disruption of basic public services such as health, education and sanitation or through rendering impossible the normal conduct of business activity. trinidad and tobago is a strong advocate for the reform of the security council to better enable that body to respond to the various security and other challenges that currently confront the international community. this is especially so having regard to the fact that, in the contemporary world, warfare is no longer the exclusive preserve of nation states. other actors, with pernicious designs, have acquired the capability to threaten states and to carry out dastardly deeds calculated to intimidate, and continue to pose serious threats to international peace and security. the united nations must therefore respond with alacrity to those threats in a manner that is acceptable to all member states. that is achievable if the security council is reformed to genuinely reflect the diversity that today characterizes and embodies the united nations. for small states such as trinidad and tobago, the maintenance of international peace and security is of paramount importance. we are keenly aware that our prospects for achieving sustainable development are inextricably linked to the safety and security of our people. however, our ability to provide such safety and security is increasingly being stretched, given that trinidad and tobago is located in a region heavily impacted by the trafficking of small arms and light weapons, as well as its attendant ills. this illicit trade is transboundary in nature and is largely associated with the drug trade and its international criminal networks. consequently, trinidad and tobago and the caribbean community fully subscribe to the aims and objectives of the arms trade treaty as a critical vehicle to address the scourge of the illicit arms trade. we do so because we understand all too well that the continued presence of this menace in our region can, if left unchecked, undermine our peace and security and limit our progress towards sustainable development. trinidad and tobago recognizes that as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the creation of the united nations, the international community still grapples with the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons. trinidad and tobago and the other members of the caribbean community join with the countries of latin america in celebrating our common commitment to denuclearization through the establishment of our region as the first nuclear-free zone in the world. the disastrous humanitarian consequences of the use of the nuclear option today for a large number of people from diverse regions of the world could result in widespread suffering, dislocation of populations and increased migration, thus undermining the peace, security and development of many countries and regions. this reality should chasten all peoples, and especially the leaders of countries possessing such weapons. accordingly, we welcome the nuclear deal negotiated by the united states, its partners and the islamic republic of iran. we wish to congratulate all the parties involved on the tenacity and patience they demonstrated in that complex and demanding process, and challenge both sides to honour their commitments. the 2030 agenda would not be fully implemented if the most vulnerable members of our societies women, children, persons with disabilities and indigenous peoples are not placed at the very centre of the development paradigm. regrettably, in some parts of the world, women and children continue to be denied fundamental human rights and freedoms, receive less pay for equal work as men and are systematically prevented from obtaining an education, all of which hinder their ability to participate in the sustainable development of their countries. since its independence, in 1962, trinidad and tobago has enacted several laws and administrative and other measures to promote and strengthen the general well-being of women and girls in society. on the international plane, we have committed to the full and effective implementation of our obligations under the convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and the convention on the rights of the child. 2429 15-29822 02102015 a70pv.26 additionally, recognizing the progressive contribution of women to peace and development, trinidad and tobago has since 2010 introduced, and been the main sponsor of, the general assembly resolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control since the year 2010. our commitment to the safety and security of our citizens remains undiminished, and as we move forward it is the intention of the government of trinidad and tobago to adopt a whole of government approach to national security, in which all ministries and national agencies will share responsibility and will be accountable for the safety of the state. to promote such an integrated and resilient approach to national security and to contribute to the attainment of sustainable development in line with the governments strategic vision for developed country status by 2030, the government of trinidad and tobago will actively pursue mechanisms to strengthen national capacities to reduce risk and to build community resilience to threats to national security. while time will not allow for a thorough review of our strategy, permit me to share some of the measures targeted for implementation the development of an adaptable defence and security posture to ensure that the traditional role of the military is integrated with new roles to ensure the security of the state; the establishment of a joint border protection agency; the adoption of an intelligence-led national security architecture; and the enhancement of our disaster risk management capability policy. the international community now accepts that climate change is a threat to our very existence. we need to be mindful, however, that this threat to humankind recognizes no boundaries, cannot be contained through high-level diplomatic talks and mediation and will weigh heavily upon developing countries, particularly small island developing states and least developed countries, thereby crippling their ability to react to external shocks to their social, economic and natural systems. like many other small island developing states, trinidad and tobago is at high risk of being severely affected by the devastating effects of climate change, and has therefore made mitigation measures a national priority, within the practical constraints of its limited financial capability. we recently witnessed the destructive effects of tropical storm erika on our fellow caribbean state member, the commonwealth of dominica, which has set back that countrys development by many years. it is undeniable, therefore, that climate change and development are closely interlinked. recognizing the need for bold and responsible action on the part of all governments, albeit on the basis of common but differentiated responsibility, trinidad and tobago has adopted a proactive posture and has submitted its intended nationally determined contributions to the united nations framework convention on climate change ahead of the 2015 paris climate change conference. it is our expectation, in conformity with that of the caribbean community, that any credible agreement from the paris conference must set the world on a path to decarbonization of the global economy before the end of the century. in order to achieve that, the agreement must be legally binding and contain provisions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, transparency and compliance that would ensure that the increase in average global temperatures can be limited to less than l.5 celsius above pre-industrial levels. an ambitious agreement in paris is therefore also an imperative for the maintenance of international peace and security in the medium to long term. trinidad and tobago is committed to work with all states to achieve a new legally binding balanced framework for global cooperation on climate change. in the area of governance of the oceans, it is well established in international law that the utilization of resources of any kind beyond areas of national jurisdiction must be consistent with the principles under the united nations convention on the law of the sea. in that regard, trinidad and tobago looks forward to active participation by all states in the preparatory committee on the development of an international legally binding instrument on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction, for the benefit of all humankind. the quest for economic and social justice for many cannot be divorced from the fervent desire of all peoples to live in freedom and without fear of persecution. in that regard, the growing religious and ethnic diversity of our societies highlights the ever-present need for mutual respect and appreciation for the value of diversity that today is a defining characteristic of many countries and communities. a lack of such tolerance and respect for human rights and human diversity has 15-29822 2529 a70pv.26 02102015 fuelled once again in our lifetime the horrific crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression. with a view to ensuring accountability for those accused of committing such crimes, and in order to act as a deterrent to would-be perpetrators, the international community established the international criminal court (icc). trinidad and tobago calls upon all states that have not as yet done so to support the icc. we applaud the initiation of steps towards full rapprochement between the united states and cuba, which has so far, among other things, been exemplified through the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two states, thus reducing tensions in our hemisphere. trinidad and tobago hopes that, sooner rather than later, that process will mature with the lifting of the anachronistic economic embargo and blockade that for too long has undermined the economic development of cuba. while we are very much encouraged by the easing of tensions in the northern caribbean with the resumption of dialogue between the united states and cuba, we are concerned by the recent developments surrounding the protracted border controversy between our neighbours, venezuela and guyana. trinidad and tobago remains convinced that the controversy should be settled by pacific means in keeping with the charter of the united nations. at the same time, trinidad and tobago reiterates the position of the caribbean community on the matter concerning citizens of the dominican republic of haitian ancestry and calls on the dominican republic to ensure that the human rights of these citizens do not continue to be infringed and are honoured in accordance with international law. once again, the failure to find a permanent solution to the israelipalestinian conflict remains of deep concern to trinidad and tobago. that situation affects the ability of both sides to live in peace and security and also impinges on the right of the palestinians to self-determination. it is our hope that both sides will work together with others in resolving this decades-old problem, resulting in the establishment of a palestinian state with clearly defined borders, coexisting in peace and security alongside the state of israel. the united nations must adapt to the ever-changing geopolitical environment as well as the emerging economic and social landscape. trinidad and tobago therefore emphasizes the imperative to move with greater alacrity on the question of the revitalization of the general assembly in order to ensure the effective execution of its mandate. the general assembly is the only institution or grouping of states that possesses the inclusiveness, and indeed the legitimacy, to act on behalf of the international community. we must therefore spare no effort to make it a more effective and dynamic instrument in the service of all the peoples of the world, elevating none about others and respecting and defending the rights of all. trinidad and tobago commits to continue to play its part at the regional and global levels to ensure that we avoid the pitfalls experienced by the united nations. we will work faithfully with others to build on the tremendous progress made by this institution over the seven decades of its life in order to bring about a greater commitment by all states to peace, security and human rights for all peoples of the world so that they may live in larger freedom and continuing prosperity.',

      "{'prompt': \"webvtt kind captions language en - instructor what i want to do in this video is to talk a little bit about spectrophotometry. spectrophotometry, photometry, which sounds fairly sophisticated, but it's really based on a fairly simple principle. so if i have, let's say we have two solutions that contain some type of solute. so that is solution one, and then this is solution two. and let's just assume that our beakers have the same width. now let's say solution, let me put it right here. number one, and number two. now let's say that solution one has less of the solute in it. so let me, let me make... so that's the water line right there. so this guy has less of it, and let's say it's yellow, or to our eyes, it looks yellow. so this has less of it. so this hasm actuallym let me do it this way. let me shade it in this. so it has less of it. and let's say solution number two has more of the solute, so it's more. so i'll just kind of represent that as more closely packed lines. so the concentration of the solute is higher here. so let me write higher concentration. higher concentration. concentration, and let's say, and this is a lower, lower concentration. now let's think about what will happen if we shine some light through each of these beakers, and let's just assume that we are shining at a wavelength of light that is specific to the... that that is specifically sensitive to the solute that we have dissolved in here. but i'll just leave that pretty general right now. so let's say i have some light here of some intensity. so let's just call that... let's call that the incident intensity. i'll just say that it's i0, so it's some intensity. what's going to happen as the light exits the other side of this beaker right here? well, some of it is going to be absorbed by our little molecules inside the beaker, so you're going to have less light come out to the other side. i'll call this i1. now, in this situation, if we shined the same amount of light into this beaker, so it's the same number that is, that is the same, the same intensity of light, what's going to happen? well, more is going to be absorbed as the light travels through this beaker. it's just going to bump into more molecules, 'cause it's a higher concentration here. so the light that comes out when you have a higher concentration, i'll call that the intensity, i'll call that i2, this is going to have a lower intensity of light that's being transmitted than this one over here. in this case, i2 is going to have a lower intensity, is going to be less than i1. if you have another beaker that is maybe twice as wide, it's twice as wide, and let's say it has the same concentration as number two, we'll call this one number three, it has the same concentration as number two. so i'll try to make it look fairly similar, and you were to shine some light in here. let's say you shine the same light in here, and you have some light that makes it through, that exits, and then this is actually what your eyes would see. so this is i3 right there. what do you think's going to happen? well, it's the same concentration, but this light has to travel a further distance of that concentration. so once again, it's going to bump into more molecules and more of it will be absorbed, and so less light will be transmitted. so i2 is less than i1, and i3, i3 is actually going to be the least. and if you were looking at these, this has the least light, this has a little bit more light being transmitted, this has the most light being transmitted. so if you were to look at this, if you placed your eyeball right here, this one right here would have the lightest color. you're getting the most light into your eye. this would be a slightly darker color, and this would be the darkest color. that makes complete sense. if you dissolve something, if you dissolve a little bit of something in water, it will still be pretty transparent. if you dissolve a lot of something in water, it'll be more opaque. and if the cup that you're dissolving in, or the beaker that you're in, gets even longer, it'll get even more opaque. so hopefully, that gives you the intuition behind spectrophotometry. and so the next question is, well, what is it even good for? why would i even care? well, you could actually use this information. you could see how much light is transmitted versus how much you put in to actually figure out the concentration of a solution. that's why we're even talking about it in a chemistry context. so before we do that, and i'll show you an example of that in the next video, let me just define some, really, some terms of ways of measuring how concentrated this is, or ways of measuring how much light is transmitted versus how much was put in. so the first thing i will define is transmittance. and so when the people who defined it said, well, you know, what we care about is how much is transmitted versus how much went in, so let's just define transmittance as that ratio. so in this example, the transmittance of number one would be the amount that got through over the amount that you put in. over here, the transmittance would be the amount that you got out over the amount that you put in. and as we see, this one right here will be a lower number. i2 is lower than i1, so this will have a lower transmittance then number one. so let's call this transmittance two. this is transmittance one. and transmittance three is the light that comes out, that gets through, over the light that goes in, and this is the smallest number, followed by that, followed by that. so this will have the least transmittance, it's the most opaque, followed by that, followed by that. now another definition, which is really kind of a derivative of the transmittance, and not in the calculus sense, it's just derived from transmittance, and we'll see, it has pretty neat properties, is the notion of absorbance. and so here, we're trying to measure, how good is it at absorbing? this is measuring, how good are you at transmitting? a higher number says you're transmitting a lot, but absorbance is how good you're absorbing, so it's kind of the opposite. if you're good at transmitting, that means you're bad at absorbing, you don't have a lot to absorb. if you're good at absorbing, that means you're not transmitting much. so absorbance. absorbance, right here, and absorbance is defined as the negative log of transmittance. and this logarithm is base 10, or you could view that if the transmittance, we've already defined as the negative, the negative log of the light that is transmitted over the light that is input, but the easiest way is the negative log of the transmittance. and so, if transmittance is a large number, absorbance is a small number, which makes sense. now, what's also cool about this. is there something called the beer-lambert law, which you could verify, and this is... we'll actually use this in the next video, beer-lambert law. i actually don't know the history of where it came from, and i'm sure it's based on somebody named beer, but i always imagined it's based on someone transmitting light through beer, the beer-lambert law. and this tells us, this tells us that the absorbance is proportional to the path length. so this would be, how far does the light have to go through the solution? so it's proportional to the path length times the concentration, times the concentration. usually we use molarity for the concentration. or another way to say it is that the absorbance is equal to some constant. it's usually a lowercase epsilon that. some constant, and this is dependent on the solution, or the solute in question, what we actually have in here and the temperature and the pressure and all of that. it's equal to constant times the length it has to travel, times the concentration. let me make it clear right here. this thing right here, this thing right here is concentration. concentration. the reason why this is super useful, as you can imagine, so let's say we have an axis right here. that's axis, and over here, i'm measuring concentration. this is our concentration axis, and we're measuring it as molarity. and let's say the molarity starts at zero. it goes, you know, i don't know, .1, .2, .3, so on and so forth. and over here, you are measuring absorbance. in the vertical axis you measure absorbance. now, let's say you have some solution, and you know the concentration, you know it is a .1 molar concentration. so let me write down m for molar. and you measure its absorbance and you just get some number here. so you measure its absorbance and you get its absorbance, so this is a low concentration, didn't absorb that much. you get, i don't know some number here, so let's say it's .25. and then let's say that you then take another known concentration, let's say .2 molar, and you say that, look, it has an absorbance right here at .5, and i should put a zero in front of these. 0.5 and 0.25. what this tells you, this is a linear relationship. for any concentration, the absorbance is going to be on a line. and if you want a little review of algebra, epsilon times the length will be the slope. but the important thing to realize is that you have a line here. you have a line here, and why? and the reason that's useful is you could use a little bit of algebra, figure out the equation of a line, or you could just look at it graphically and say, okay, i had two known concentrations, and i was able to figure out the absorbance. you can then go the other way around. you could then measure for some unknown concentration. you could figure out its absorbance. so let's say there's some unknown concentration, and you figure out its absorbance is right over here. let's say it's .4. then you can just go on this line right here, and you say, okay, well then that must be, that must be a concentration of this, well, whatever number this is. and you could measure it, or you could actually figure it out algebraically. and so this will be pretty close to .2 molar, a little bit less than 0.2 molar. and we're gonna actually do an example of that in the next video.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"webvtt kind captions language en we have the equation negative 9 minus this whole expression, 9x minus 6-- this whole thing is being subtracted from negative 9-- is equal to 3 times this whole expression, 4x plus 6. now, a good place to start is to just get rid of these parentheses. and the best way to get rid of these parentheses is to kind of multiply them out. this has a negative 1-- you just see a minus here, but it's just really the same thing as having a negative 1-- times this quantity. and here you have a 3 times this quantity. so let's multiply it out using the distributive property. so the left-hand side of our equation, we have our negative 9. and then we want to multiply the negative 1 times each of these terms. so negative 1 times 9x is negative 9x, and then negative 1 times negative 6 is plus 6, or positive 6. and then that is going to be equal to-- let's distribute the 3-- 3 times 4x is 12x. and then 3 times 6 is 18. now what we want to do, let's combine our constant terms, if we can. we have a negative 9 and a 6 here, on this side, we've combined all of our terms. we can't combine a 12x and an 18, so let's combine this. so let's combine the negative 9 and the 6, our two constant terms on the left-hand side of the equation. so we're going to have this negative 9x. so we're going to have negative 9x plus-- let's see, we have a negative 9 and then plus 6-- so negative 9 plus 6 is negative 3. so we're going to have a negative 9x, and then we have a negative 3, so minus 3 right here. that's the negative 9 plus the 6, and that is equal to 12x plus 18. now, we want to group all the x terms on one side of the equation, and all of the constant terms-- the negative 3 and the positive 18 on the other side-- i to always have my x terms on the left-hand side, if i can. you don't have to have them on the left, so let's do that. so if i want all my x terms on the left, i have to get rid of this 12x from the right. and the best way to do that is to subtract 12x from both sides of the equation. so let me subtract 12x from the right, and subtract 12x from the left. now, on the left-hand side, i have negative 9x minus 12x. so negative 9 minus 12, that's negative 21. negative 21x minus 3 is equal to-- 12x minus 12x, well, that's just nothing. that's 0. so i could write a 0 here, but i don't have to write anything. that was the whole point of subtracting the 12x from the left-hand side. and that is going to be equal to-- so on the right-hand side, we just are left with an 18. we are just left with that 18 here. these guys canceled out. now, let's get rid of this negative 3 from the left-hand side. so on the left-hand side, we only have x terms, and on the right-hand side, we only have constant terms. so the best way to cancel out a negative 3 is to add 3. so it cancels out to 0. so we're going to add 3 to the left, let's add 3 to the right. and we get-- the left-hand side of the equation, we have the negative 21x, no other x term to add or subtract here, so we have negative 21x. the negative 3 and the plus 3, or the positive 3, cancel out-- that was the whole point-- equals-- what's 18 plus 3? 18 plus 3 is 21. so now we have negative 21x is equal to 21. and we want to solve for x. so if you have something times x, and you just want it to be an x, let's divide by that something. and in this case, that something is negative 21. so let's divide both sides of this equation by negative 21. divide both sides by negative 21. the left-hand side, negative 21 divided by negative 21, you're just left with an x. that was the whole point behind dividing by negative 21. and we get x is equal to-- what's 21 divided by negative 21? well, that's just negative 1. right? you have the positive version divided by the negative version of itself, so it's just negative 1. so that is our answer. now let's verify that this actually works for that original equation. so let's substitute negative 1 into that original equation. so we have negative 9-- i'll do it over here; i'll do it in a different color than we've been using-- we have negative 9 minus-- that 1 wasn't there originally, it's there implicitly-- minus 9 times negative 1. 9 times-- i'll put negative 1 in parentheses-- minus 6 is equal to-- well, actually, let me just solve for the left-hand side when i substitute a negative 1 there. so the left-hand side becomes negative 9, minus 9 times negative 1 is negative 9, minus 6. and so this is negative 9 minus-- in parentheses-- negative 9 minus 6 is negative 15. so this is equal to negative 15. and so we get negative 9-- let me make sure i did that-- negative 9 minus 6, yep, negative 15. so negative 9 minus negative 15, that's the same thing as negative 9 plus 15, which is 6. so that's what we get on the left-hand side of the equation when we substitute x is equal to negative 1. we get that it equals 6. so let's see what happens when we substitute negative 1 to the right-hand side of the equation. i'll do it in green. we get 3 times 4 times negative 1 plus 6. so that is 3 times negative 4 plus 6. negative 4 plus 6 is 2. so it's 3 times 2, which is also 6. so when x is equal to negative 1, you substitute here, the left-hand side becomes 6, and the right-hand side becomes 6. so this definitely works out.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",
      "{'prompt': \"i should first of all. sir, to convey to you my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the general assembly. you represent a continent that plays a primary and increasingly authoritative role on the world scene and a country with an ancient civilization and traditions to which italy is bound by ties of warm friendship and co-operation. i also wish to extend my warmest thanks and congratulations to your predecessor. ambassador jaime de pinies. once again from this rostrum i should to pay a tribute to the secretary-general mr. perez de cuellar, with whom we enjoy relations of profound trust and esteem, and reiterate the italian government's appreciation of his persevering efforts to promote the principles of the united nations charter and strengthen the role and machinery of the organization. the secretary of state for foreign and commonwealth affairs of the united kingdom, in his capacity as current president of the european community, illustrated this morning the views of its 12 member states on the major issues today facing the international community. those views, which we share, are the expression of policies which are aimed at promoting greater stability and co-operation in international relations. the dramatic and sometimes tragic events we have witnessed in the past few months have made us acutely aware, perhaps as never before, that the world in which we live is one of interdependence. we have seen how the effects of conflict tensions can jeopardize global security and gained a better understanding of the interrelationship of the economies of different and even distant areas. we have also had direct proof that man's achievements in science and technology, both positive and negative, know no frontiers. it was for this reason that we decided to make co-operation and dialog the central theme of the celebration of the international year of peace which took place in rome last july. that celebration was, in fact, marked by a meeting devoted to 'dialog as the universal foundation of peace'. i should to take this opportunity to thank the secretary-general for agreeing to participate in the meeting and address it. dialog is needed more than ever before in the field of science. if any lesson has been learned from the tragic events of chernobyl it is that science, in releasing new and unforeseeable powerful energies and resources, has certainly opened up possibilities for progress, but has also liberated forces which could destroy us. we therefore need intensive collaboration among scientists, which will prove possible only if we are able to translate fully into reality the idea of an international scientific community without frontiers. we should, however, harbor no illusion that this scientific community will materialize spontaneously. as government leaders, we must, rather, work to encourage its realization. we must therefore think of new instruments better suited to present needs. at the scientific meetings which took place in ericem sicily, and which italy not only hosted but fully supported, participants put forward ideas, proposals and concrete programs, such as the program for open laboratories, which are, in our view, a step in the right direction and which are starting to attract the attention of governments. the establishment in geneva of the world laboratory is a concrete example of the extent to which the scientific community can make a concrete contribution to the east-west and the north-south dialog and to the building of peace. renowned scientists, academicians and nobel prize winners, including numerous representatives of the third world as well as prestigious institutions, have signed the constituent act of the laboratory. their goal is to promote science without secrets or frontiers, in the just belief that the free circulation of scientific information is a powerful instrument capable of creating a climate of safely and mutual trust in east and west and in north and south. in the most important negotiations on arms limitations, in which the main participants are the united states and the soviet union, the parties have put forward at the negotiating table various proposals which, in our view, indicate their common determination to achieve reductions in the most destructive weapons. a new summit meeting between the two major powers, while responding to the expectations of so many countries, could give an irreversible impetus to this trend. a balance of forces at levels lower than those existing today must be achieved, but essential requirements must be respected such a balance must be established at the global level, taking into account the interrelationship which exists between the various components of military equilibrium. the italian government, for its part, attaches great importance to the prospects which seem to be opening up for negotiations aimed at achieving balanced reductions of conventional forces in europe. a decisive role in the pursuit of disarmament agreements is also being played by the geneva conference on disarmament. we hope that the work of the conference will result, inter alia, in the speedy conclusion of a convention for a total and verifiable ban on chemical weapons. in the same spirit we welcome the constructive compromise agreement that was reached at the conference on confidence and security building measures and disarmament in europe, held in stockholm. we hope that this agreement will be the basis for a new and more constructive approach to a problem which is of primary concern to european countries. this agreement augurs well for the future, in our view, because it signals a more general willingness to seek compromise. we hope in particular that the third follow-up meeting to the conference on security and co-operation in europe, in vienna, will result in a qualitative change in east-west relations affecting not ony dealings between states but the situation of their citizens. another area in which dialog and international co-operation are necessary, is that of terrorism, which is the very antithesis of dialog, reason and persuasion. terrorism is a grave threat to peace. mo political situation, however unjust, can justify any departure for even a moment from the principles of law. nor can there be any justification for the conduct of those who deliberately disregard their obligation to seek political solutions to their problems, thereby jeopardizing the well-established supremacy of law over force. if we stray from the path of law we have anarchy and the triumph of irrationality. i believe, nevertheless, that there is a growing consensus on the need for a joint, organized response to that phenomenon of such alarming dimensions, beginning with the determination and identification of responsibilities. solidarity in the fight against terrorism can already be seen at the regional level within the framework of the european community and that of the summit meeting of the seven industrialized countries in tokyo, as well as in the broader framework of the united nations. in this context may i recall the initiative taken by italy - in association with other friendly countries - in proposing a convention on the safety of shipping and our support for the canadian initiative on airport security. moreover, italy is convinced of the need for stricter compliance with the norms of general international law, including the vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular relations. for this reason we recently adopted measures for the control of diplomatic pouches. we hope that other countries will follow our example, thus contributing to international co-operation in suppressing the traffic in arms. it is essential also, in my view, to work to remove those causes of tension that offer terrorism alibis which are in some cases far too easy. i am thinking in particular of those areas where crises are most acute, such as the middle east. throughout the area there are manifestations of a profound desire for peace, justice and attempts at dialog which are even breaking through the traditional psychological barriers between the arab world and israel, and between israel and the soviet union. however, we note with regret that certain preconditions are still being maintained and that there is no prospect of their being reconsidered in the future. this prevents achievement of the two necessary bases for a just and lasting solution of the middle east conflict the right of all states in the region, including israel, to a peaceful and secure existence and the palestinian people's right to self-determination. a dialog must finally be started on that basis and in pursuance of those objectives, with the indispensable participation of all the parties concerned and the constructive support of those countries which are in a position to play a significant role in the region. italy, together with its european partners, remains determined to contribute to that dialog, to the best of its ability and with the utmost dedication. we must also work to bring to an end the state of blind and chaotic violence prevailing in lebanon and to promote a frank and sincere dialog between all the communities of that country. italy is contributing to the stability and security of at least part of that country through its participation in the united nations interim force in lebanon (unifil). we believe that united nations forces still have an important role to play in that area. that role is, first of all, the one decided by the security council in its resolution 425 (1978), which must be respected and implemented in its entirety. at the same time it would be unjust to ignore the positive effects of the presence of the peace-keeping force in southern lebanon, even under present conditions. for this reason we must carefully consider whether withdrawal of the force would not entail the risk of further jeopardizing chances for a positive evolution of the situation. we would to see the method of dialog applied to other situations in areas adjacent to the mediterranean region where distressing and dangerous crises persist and in some cases are escalating. i am thinking in particular of the conflict between iraq and iran which continues to cause tragic losses of life and large-scale material damage. our organization has repeatedly issued resolute and specific calls for peace, and no effort has been spared to initiate peace negotiations. we all remember the efforts deployed to this end by the late olof palme. we believe that the security council should make another solemn appeal for a cease-fire and a return to peace. should such an appeal go unheeded, it would be necessary to use all the means available under the charter of the united nations for the restoration of order in a situation in which it was clearly violated. at the special session on africa held last may, africa's problems were confronted in a spirit of constructive realism. the african governments recognize that they themselves bear the primary responsibility for the continent's economic take-off and have undertaken to pursue policies designed to start an autonomous development process with the co-operation of the international community. italy intends to make a contribution to follow-up action to the special session. in regard to the central problem of external indebtedness and its consequences, i intend to inform the ministers for foreign affairs of sub-saharan africa of our intention when the italian delegation meets with them later this week. our purpose is to try to move to the stage of concrete operative solutions, which may also serve as an experiment and an example. while the method of dialog is making headway, for example, in the direct talks between ethiopia and somalia, unfortunately we find that within south africa repression and violence are being stepped up and the prospects of peacefully eliminating a system based on racist principles are receding. the international community must continue to exert every effort to promote favorable conditions for the initiation of a dialog between the government and the political and social forces in the country aimed at building a society based on justice, equality and the full realization of the legitimate civil and political rights of all south africans. the south african government cannot continue to ignore the unanimous reprobation of the international community. the twelve recently decided to send a clear signal to the south african government by moving from the stage of restrictive measures to that of sanctions in the full sense of the term. at the same time they will continue to assist the black population of south africa and neighboring countries. the process of restoring and strengthening free and democratic institutions in latin america certainly offers grounds for hope, in spite of the fact that freedom continues to be denied in a country chile where democratic traditions are among the oldest in the region. political gains are, however, in danger of being nullified by a widespread economic crisis, with all its disruptive effects. we must therefore exercise constant vigilance and concretely commit ourselves to preventing social forces hostile to democracy, and the economic situation, from jeopardizing results that have been achieved at great cost. in asia, a crisis the one prevailing in afghanistan has repercussions which are felt well beyond the regional context. we hope that the proximity talks held under the auspices of the secretary-general will lead to positive developments. italy continues to believe that a negotiated solution of that crisis must lead to a genuine and speedy withdrawal of foreign troops from afghanistan and the restoration of the independence and self-determination of that country. a similar solution should be sought for the question of kampuchea. we are therefore deeply concerned at the absence of even the first signs of a dialog capable of leading to a just and peaceful settlement of that problem. the system of dialog and multilateral co-operation, in which we believe, must go hand in hand with a healthy development of international economic collaboration. many problems remain to be resolved in this field. among them, besides the problem of indebtedness - which i have already mentioned - is the need to ensure that international trade enjoys a sustained and balanced growth, which will require the elimination of protectionist practices, the removal of non-tariff barriers, and also a redefinition of national policies to support agriculture. the tasks confronting the united nations affect not only relations between states but, in the current circumstances, also the well-being and progress of peoples owing to problems such as terrorism and drugs that tend to erode the very fabric of our societies. the problem of drugs, for instance, is an international phenomenon with complex structures and manifestations. it therefore requires an international response. for this reason italy puts high hopes in the action of the united nations, particularly the united nations fund for drug abuse control (unfdac), in this field and is making a substantial contribution to it in terms of efforts and financial resources. if the united nations system is to meet appropriately such a vast range of responsibilities and commitments, it must constantly improve the efficiency of its machinery. we therefore support the action taken by the secretary-general and the general assembly to ensure sound, effective administration of this organization. in that spirit we welcome the proposals contained in the report of the group of high-level intergovernmental experts. however, our goal must be clearly understood we want to strengthen the united nations system, certainly not promote a reduction in its role. italy is a member of the two great, free political systems of the west, the atlantic alliance and the european community. in our view this strengthens our capacity to participate fully in the life and activities of the broader multilateral system represented by the united nations. the process of european integration, which italy pursues with particular conviction, has the purpose of increasing the capability of european countries to contribute to stability in international relations and to removing tensions and conflicts, promoting economic and social development and co-operation and, lastly, reaffirming those values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights that are an integral part of european civilization. it is in this spirit that italy is participating in the building of a europe which we believe is bound in the not too distant figure to become the main partner of all states members of this organization that share the same objectives of peace and progress.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"99. mr. president, it gives me pleasure to hail your unanimous election to the presidency of the thirty-third session of our assembly. upper volta particularly welcomes the fact that it is the representative of a friendly country, colombia, who is guiding our work. you are the son of a continent whose destiny is akin to that of africa. therefore, we are both bound to fight in solidarity against under-development and for peace and justice. my delegation assures you of its full collaboration, especially as we place our trust in your personal qualities. 100. allow me on behalf of the delegation of upper volta to congratulate your predecessor, mr. lazar mojsov, for the outstanding way in which he guided the work of the regular and special sessions of the last year. 101. i would be remiss if i forgot all those whose daily efforts contribute to the smooth functioning of our organization. 102. it is only right to recognize the leading role played by our secretary-general, mr. kurt waldheim, and his various assistants. may i again assure him of our entire trust, and congratulate him most cordially for his ceaseless efforts in favour of the poorer countries. 103. we also congratulate solomon islands on its admission to membership in our organization. we have no doubt that that young state will make a valuable contribution in the quest for peace and international security. 104. the 30 years from 1948 to 1978, the space of a generation, should have sufficed for man to make changes commensurate with his genius. our universal declaration of human rights is surely a huge profession of faith. it is the creed of those who, having lived through the worst horrors that man has ever inflicted on man, had the moral strength to proclaim that man is still the only value. as for the means of restoring humanity's battered dignity, those who signed the declaration in 1948 relied on the genius of their fellowman and the will of governments. 105. we all know what the situation was, and what it is now. 106. while fantastic scientific progress each passing day demonstrates anew the intelligence of our species and its capacity to progress beyond the realm of what is conceivable, exasperating inequalities make us doubt the possibility of satisfying the requirements set forth in the declaration of human rights. 107. upper volta, which endorses the principles of that declaration in the preamble to its constitution of 28 november 1977, also makes it its main preoccupation, not in order to be in the fashion but because the people of upper volta are profoundly committed to the ideals of freedom, dignity and justice. 108. what some have called the 'upper volta experiment' is nothing but an attempt by an entire people to achieve its own idea of happiness by its own means and by actions of its choice. our experiment is a struggle for freedom, since it enshrines respect for man in his physical, moral and intellectual integrity. our experiment, under the enlightened guidance of general aboubakar sangoule lamizana, the president of the republic, is a struggle for the dignity of our proud, hard-working people, with whom, however, nature has not been lavish. our experiment is, finally, a daily struggle for justice-justice which is emblazoned in our motto and in our hearts, justice for our peoples and for the peoples of the whole world. this is well known by our partners in the united nations, who have followed our militant efforts for the establishment of an international order based on equity and justice. 109. it is in the name of these principles that we reject attempts at denial of the human person, especially when they are accompanied by violence. 110. aerial hijacking and international terrorism, to quote but these two phenomena, have been able to make their appearance in recent years as simultaneous products of a world of interdependence and of a society of rapid communication. we cannot but be anxious given their ever-increasing scale. we are entitled to ask ourselves why the international community seems nonplussed, even defenceless, in the face of these acts of violence. perhaps the universal conscience, revolted to the very core by their effect, is not sufficiently abreast of the causes. ill indeed it seems urgent to ask that the international community and in particular our organization strive to find equitable solutions to the problems which are at the basis of this violence. 112. in upper volta we place our faith in man. that is why we wage relentless war against such outmoded concepts as racial discrimination and its most ignoble manifestation, apartheid. 113 the decade for action to combat racism and racial discrimination which we proclaimed five years ago resolution 3057 (xxviii) runs the risk of being the greatest failure of our organization unless we are determined to implement the repressive measures which are called for and to use some of the means provided for in our charter. the year 1978, which marks the mid-decade and which we call 'international anti-apartheid year', must not come to a close without the international community chalking up even a slight victory against the pretoria regime 114. the best opportunity would be for us to find a solution to the namibian problem 115. the patience of our organization has been taxed with regard to that territory. the subtle facets of the problem require caution if its ideal of peace is to be achieved. unfortunately the other side has never been equal to its responsibilities. the declaration of the racist, vorster, dated 20 september last, is proof that soum africa only understands the language of violence. for our part we have followed with the greatest interest, although without any illusions, the efforts of the five western powers, members of the security council, in their desperate attempts to persuade south africa to accept the inevitable independence of namibia in dignity. 116. the ninth special session, which we devoted to the question of namibia, was an occasion to spell out in no uncertain terms the condition of accession of that territory to international sovereignty. six months later, those conditions still remain valid. namibia, an international territory under the direct responsibility of the united nations, cannot be liberated in violation of the sacred principles of our organization. to spare the south african usurper any longer would cause us to endorse the annexation of walvis bay on the one hand and to consecrate the introduction of apartheid in namibia on the other. we must therefore decide whether we want to make namibia yet another bantustan or a sovereign state that we would be proud to welcome as a full-fledged member of our organization. upper volta for its part, welcomes resolution 435 (1978), adopted by the security council on 29 september 1978, and requests the international community to face up to its responsibilities, all its responsibilities. 117. it is interesting to note the similar methods used by the racists of pretoria and salisbury. from hoodwinking to slurp practices, from vain promises to frauds made into a system of government, the ian smith regime has nothing to learn from that of pretoria. 118. today it is clear for everybody including the friends of salisbury that the so-called internal settlement was simply aimed at perpetuating the domination of the white minority at the risk of imperilling the very existence of that community. 119. the agreements dividing the people of zimbabwe soon showed their limitations because they even failed to conceal the rivalries which tear asunder those who subscribed to them. 120. the failure of the biracial government of salisbury and the exacerbation of tension in the subregion should be enough to convince the racist ian smith that the salvation of rhodesia and the white minority lies in majority rule. 121. the peril to international peace caused by these discredited regimes of pretoria and salisbury is one of the principal concerns of my government. africa in general and upper volta in particular require guarantees. our concern is that our development should be accomplished in an uninterrupted way without the threat of world conflagration which we know is inevitable as long as certain pockets of tension persist especially on the african continent and in the middle east. 122 that is why my country, upper volta, follows with the greatest of attention and the keenest interest the efforts for peace being deployed on the middle east question. 123 my government will be among those who welcome any hope of peace in the region, on the condition, nevertheless, that they do not carry the seeds of their own destruction. for that, the partners should make sure that they do not trample underfoot the legitimate rights of the palestinian people. 124 several events have occurred over this year which, whatever their importance and their impact on the policies of nations, have scarcely eased the lot of peoples still enslaved by poverty. nevertheless the rich countries are over-equipped they have bought more armaments; they have proliferated their sovereign enterprises of the most wasteful kind. as an example world military expenditure has increased from $245 billion in 1973 to more than s500 billion at the present time. 125. what is to be done? only international co-operation based on a dynamic, genuine solidarity can save our civilization from the scourges of hunger, malnutrition, disease and ignorance. 126. the initiative of our organization to hold the united nations conference on technical co-operation among developing countries was an opportunity to stress once again the seriousness of the international economic situation. the fact that mankind is divided into two very unequal camps is something to which we are now accustomed, since it is so true that the disparities in development stem from the very nature of things. but for the international conscience to stand by helplessly as it witnesses the growing gap between the rich and poor is both disconcerting and revolting. it is no secret to anyone in this hall that of 4 billion inhabitants on our planet, 800 million only, that is to say one fifth of the world population, are free from material worries. the rest, that is to say more than 3 billion men, still live in deprivation or even utter poverty 127 last year i had an opportunity in this same forum10 to advocate on behalf of my country, upper volta, the definition of a new international morality. 128. the present situation does not lead me to think that my proposal is obsolete. in no way .would i claim to invent the definition but i believe that the president of the united states mr. jimmy carter has already emphasized one of the crucial points by taking up the challenge of human rights. 129. that is certainly a gigantic undertaking, on which, however, depends the very survival of the whole of mankind, because it is only the people, when they have an opportunity to think and to have their say, who can dispel the countless threats which torment our world today. 130. indeed, the atmosphere generally prevailing is one of merciless rivalry, economic and commercial competition and ideological confrontation, which allows no time for humanistic feelings and still less for consideration of the individual rights of human beings and citizens. 131. fortunately, nations with a tradition of generosity in the conception of human rights and freedom know how to escape from the threat of this gangrene and do not hesitate to use all their moral authority to secure respect for this moral imperative. 132. in an infinitely more modest context, and without presuming to lecture anyone, upper volta also has resolutely committed itself to this course, which is certainly difficult and full of pitfalls but which in the long run should further improve the flattering image others already have of us. 133. our task, however, is made particularly arduous because of certain objective situations which limit the impact and the results of our efforts. 134. there is, first of all, that circumstance which is a more or less interdependent phenomenon, of desertification and drought, which for the past eight years now has kept the countries of the sahelian region in a state of permanent anguish. the world's public has been sensitized to this tragedy and has already responded in active and effective solidarity, but a valid solution can be sought only through a certain number of medium-term and long-term actions. 135. in this respect one may and should recall the action now being taken in liaison with the permanent inter-state committee on drought control in the sahel. that action, on the basis of the 'compendium' adopted by the conference of the .heads of state of the sahelian countries, which met at ouagadougou in 1973, consists in the medium-term planning of studies and projects to propose a weather warning system, to establish a regional plan to mobilize action in the event of future droughts, to supervise the shipment of means of assistance by road and to establish a regional pasture rehabilitation plan. 136. on a longer-term basis, cilss intends to develop a global development strategy to prevent a repetition of such a calamity, by laying the emphasis on the control of weather factors, reafforestation, hydro-agricultural management, training and research. 137. the current chairman of cilss explained here, on 22 september 4th meeting, the action taken for the rehabilitation of the sahel and drew the attention of the international community to the immense tasks which remained to be carried out. upper volta, where headquarters of cilss and the regional office of the united nations sahelian office are situated, fully endorses that statement and would to avail itself of this opportunity to pay a particular tribute to the president of the gambia for his tireless efforts. however, it would perhaps be conceivable for the united nations to launch, in parallel, a 'decade of the tree', which would promote the necessary sensitivity concerning that aspect of the problems of the sahel, and at the same time to establish an appropriate framework for decisive action to be carried out by people of goodwill who are waiting only to be called upon to act. 138. however, beyond this crisis situation which prevails in the sahelian countries we must emphasize the problems of food and water which affect our world. indeed, as was appropriately emphasized by the united nations conference on desertification, only an ecological readjustment on a world scale can assist us in facing the world food shortage. 139. for the developing countries, where the situation is most alarming, that deficit is caused by two decisive factors. first, there is the decline in world cereal production according to fao statistics 26 developing countries at present suffer serious food shortages. those countries, whose total population amounts to 250 million inhabitants, are located in africa and south-east asia most of them belong to the group of least developed countries. since 1970, the food production of the developing countries has risen at the rate of 1.5 per cent per year compared with 3 per cent per year in the industrialized countries, while the population of the third world has grown at twice the rate of that of the rich countries. further, there is the reduction in international aid. it is estimated that in 1976 agricultural aid granted by the rich countries to the poorer countries declined by 9 per cent in real terms. the effect of that is obviously a lowering in the standard of living. whereas at the beginning of the present decade, that is to say in 1971, it was estimated that 400 million people suffered from malnutrition, today that figure has risen to 455 million. without going into the details of it, that observation starkly reveals the tragedy which traumatizes four fifths of mankind. to ensure the daily subsistence needs of 3 billion people subjected to deprivation and to preserve future generations from the psychosis of hunger seems to us the primary task of the international community. apart from the fact that food aid serves to alleviate the chronic undernourishment and malnutrition of particularly vulnerable people, such as the aged and mothers and children, it also meets the pressing needs created by natural disasters. the countries of the sahel, members of cilss, have in their time been able to appreciate the benefits of international assistance in this field. let us also recognize that this form of aid also helps the balance of payments of developing countries since it lowers the cost of imports in that sector. according to fao statistics, the cereal import needs of 49 developing countries, the least advanced, which have priority from the point of food needs, amount this year to 21 million tons. at the same time, the cost of cereals imports in all developing countries rose from $4 billion in 1972 to some $13 billion in 1976. in view of these observations, i am sure the assembly will agree with mo that we must establish bases for genuine world food security. that concept could be reflected in the initial stage, to help in meeting the needs of the most needy, by the establishment of buffer stocks, the regulatory rule of which would make it possible to cope with changing needs. from the structural point of view, fao, which has already done so much, would play a supervisory role and the wfp would carry out the regulatory function. such a proposal, if it were to be implemented through a strict methodology, would have the triple advantage of at all times compensating for the food shortages of the needy countries, restraining the rise of food prices, and encouraging farmers not to lower their production. 140. however, these are only expedients, at least as regards the particular situation of my country and the other countries in the sahel. the true 'long-term solution lies in large-scale ventures to provide irrigated land, because we are convinced that water is one of the primary factors of life-hence the importance of the water problem. the treatises drafted for the united nations conference on water,12 bear witness to the great potential of the third world's water resources. the rivers of asia, south america and africa are the principal rivers of the world, because of their volume and their exploitability. the only remaining problem is to apply a rational policy of water control. the most serious studies show that africa and asia can become the granaries of the world, as long as the necessary financing, material and technology are made available to them. that is why we appeal once again to the solidarity of the nations gathered here to bring about an improvement in aid policies. to this end, we must redefine and draw up a system of global co-operation for a world that will be no longer a world of donors and recipients but one of interdependence based on equality of rights among partners. for never has the international community been so aware of the interdependence that links the rich and the poor countries in the same destiny, that of establishing a just and lasting peace through the final solution of the greatest scourge of our timeunder-development. 141. to paraphrase an illustrious, now departed, pioneer of peace, upper volta expects that in the field of international solidarity every man will do his duty. that duty is, as it was 33 years ago, to safeguard man and ensure his daily survival; that duty is, as it was 33 years ago, to safeguard peace.\",

      "{'prompt': 'a few weeks ago, the empire state building was lit up in orange, the national colour of the netherlands. the reason was that, precisely 400 years ago, the dutch east india company commissioned henry hudson to find a shorter sea route to asia via the north. after a brutal voyage filled with hardships, hudson decided to change course. he never found his shortcut to asia, but he did become the first person to map the area around the river that would one day bear his name, including the place where we are gathered today. ever since then, the origin of the great city of new york has been closely linked with the courage and resolve of henry hudson. today more than ever before, we must make those qualities our own. in the past year, we have faced the harsh reality of a financial and economic system on the brink. the crisis has been so severe and so rapid that courage and resolve are now required of us all the courage to place shared values and interests above narrow self- interest, the resolve to adapt existing global governance structures to a new reality and the courage to make decisive choices that take account of all interests, especially those of the worlds weakest and poorest people. that is my clear message to the general assembly. the dutch government has no doubt that a strong, decisive and efficient united nations will be vital to that process. only an integrated global approach will deliver the stability, solidarity and sustainability that the world needs so badly. the last few days in new york and pittsburgh have shown that there is a clear realization that the world has changed and that we must work together more closely than ever before. our interdependency gives us a shared responsibility. we can see now that the problems we face are too big for any single nation. there is therefore strong will to address the underlying causes of the economic crisis, to work on systemic imbalances and to once again make finance a tool for growth. the agreement we reached in pittsburgh on a framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth is a big step forward. it shows that there is a widely shared conviction that we have much to gain from stability, solidarity and sustainability, both as individual countries and collectively. i would to say a few words about each of those core concepts. 9 09-52586 the current crisis offers clear proof that in a globalized world instability anywhere is a threat to stability everywhere. the international policy response has shown that that is widely understood in the financial and economic context. that is a positive sign, even if there is still a long way to go. the pittsburgh agreement on compensation systems should end a bonus culture that has grown out of control. we cannot allow the greed of a few to endanger the jobs of many. we must therefore prevent that kind of crisis from ever happening again. mr. valero briceño (bolivarian republic of venezuela), vice-president, took the chair. institutional reform should not stop with the financial and economic sector. there is a clear need for new arrangements that will allow us to manage a range of global governance issues at the same time. in the long term, the greatest threat to a stable world order is to allow the crisis to push the worlds other great problems into the background climate change, for example, the energy and food crisis or the pressing issues of peace and security, poverty and human rights. we cannot let that happen. in some cases, we simply have to honour commitments that we have already made, such as the millennium development goals. in others, we need the courage to see beyond this crisis to the world of tomorrow, as we must show at the climate summit to be held in copenhagen. in any event, the current situation demands that we place our common global values and interests above our acute domestic problems, however serious they may be. therefore, now more than ever, we need a strong, decisive and efficient united nations. we need it here in new york, but we especially need it on the ground. in that context, i would highlight the vital importance of the one united nations initiative, which needs follow-up, and soon. stability cannot be achieved without respect for human rights. as friends of the iranian people, we are concerned about the worsening human rights situation and the violent crackdown on popular protests. the iranian nuclear issue represents a major challenge to international peace and security, to regional stability and to the non-proliferation regime. the recent revelation of a nuclear facility that was long kept secret is additional reason for great concern. it calls for a strong reaction by the international community and for total transparency by iran. iran must regain the trust of the international community, comply with relevant security council resolutions and contribute to peace and stability in the middle east. in june of this year, the united nations showed leadership by holding a major conference here in new york on the effects of the crisis for developing countries. the netherlands fully supported that initiative, as there can be no stability without solidarity. after all, there is nothing more destabilizing than poverty, hunger and a future without hope. the economic crisis and rising food prices are threatening to sweep away a great deal of hard-won progress. in 2009 alone, the number of people forced to live on less than $1.25 a day will grow by at least 55 million. there is a real danger that those who had no part in causing the crisis will be the people who suffer most deeply. in rich countries the crisis means the loss of jobs and assets. in developing countries it means rising child mortality and rising hunger. therefore, in rich countries the crisis is serious; in poor countries it is a matter of life and death. let the donor countries honour an old promise and set aside at least 0.7 per cent of their national income every year for development aid; and let the current crisis also inspire recipient countries to use the funds as effectively as possible. now more than ever, public support for development aid depends on transparency, good governance and an effective fight against corruption. i would also add that international solidarity is not simply a question of development budgets. it also concerns the private sector. more and more businesses now recognize the importance of corporate social responsibility. i believe there is still a world to be won in that regard, not only for society but also for companies themselves. corporate social responsibility makes good business sense. my third subject, sustainability, is essentially about making choices and sacrifices, not for our own sake but for future generations. this session of the general assembly is our last major stop on the road to copenhagen. we should be aware that the progress we make there will affect the lives of our children, our childrens children and so on, down through the generations. that must be our main motive for seeking a radical change in the way we live. 09-52586 10 in copenhagen we must reach an ambitious, fair and comprehensive agreement. we must be ambitious and set our sights high. therefore, at copenhagen the netherlands will call for worldwide carbon dioxide emissions to be halved from 1990 levels by 2050. we should be fair to developing countries. every country should contribute to the common goal according to its means. every country will be expected to play its part. but those that need help in designing and implementing sound adaptation policies must receive it. that is why the netherlands has set aside 500 million to promote the use of renewable energy in developing countries. comprehensive also means that we should not simply pave the road ahead with good intentions, but with concrete agreements for example, agreements on developing the global carbon market, on sharing knowledge and on financial arrangements. we simply cannot fail at copenhagen. the world is much smaller than it was in the days of henry hudson, but it is far more complex as a result. any solution to the issues i have raised today starts with recognizing our mutual dependence and responsibility. within the concepts of stability, solidarity and sustainability we will find the shared values and interests that should guide us on the road ahead. it is a road that requires courage. but to echo the words i heard recently from the italian nobel prize winner and senator for life rita levi-montalcini, on her one-hundredth birthday, dont fear difficult moments. the best comes from them. let us go forward in that spirit.', 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

let's think a little bit about what yearly profit means. let's think a little bit about yearly profit. the profit is going to be equal to the quantity that you sell times what? for each unit, what you care about is the profit per unit, and the profit per unit is the selling price per unit minus the cost of producing that unit. the cost of producing the unit right there is $20-- minus $20. that makes sense. if you're selling something for $30, and it costs you $20 to make it, every unit that you sell, you'll make $10-- 30 minus 20. if you sell two units, it's going to be 2 times $10, and you're going to make $20. nothing really groundbreaking right here. right now we have profit as a function of q, of quantity and selling price, but we have quantity as a function of selling price right here, so we could substitute this whole expression right here in for quantity. what happens to our profit function then? then we can rewrite our profit function as being equal to-- instead of writing q, we could say it as the same thing as negative 30s plus 800 times s minus 20. let's multiply this out so we have a nice, clean trinomial. our profit is going to be equal to negative 30s times s and that's negative 30s squared. negative 30s times negative 20 is positive 600s, and 800 times s is 800s. then, 800 times negative 20 times negative 2 would be negative 1,600, so it's going to be negative 16,000, if i did it right. this right here is our profit function, and we can merge these middle two terms right here. we have our profit is equal to negative 30s squared plus 1,400s-- just merging these middle two terms-- minus 16,000. now, we have a negative coefficient on the s squared term, which tells us this will be a downward opening parabola, and so let's think a little bit about it. if this is our profit axis, and this right here is our selling price axis, this parabola is going to look something this-- i don't know exactly what it will look , but it will look something this. it will be downward opening. we're asked to find the selling price that optimizes the yearly profit. it's optimal if it's as high as possible, so we're going to look for a maximum point. we're going to look for that maximum point right there, find the selling point that gives us that maximum point. we've seen. this before. that's the selling point, or the s coordinate of the vertex-- we need to find the s coordinate of the vertex. the easiest way to think of doing that is to put this function into our vertex form, so let's do that. the easiest way to do that i can think of-- well, we're going to come a little bit of completing the square and all that, but we've seen all of this before, so let's take it step by step. first thing i to do is factor out the negative 30, so we have a clean coefficient on the s squared. we could write price is equal to negative 30 times s squared plus-- 1,400 hundred divided by negative 30 is negative 1403, and you can divide both by 10 s. then, 16,000 divided by negative 30 is positive 1,600 divided by 3-- you take a 0 off of each of those, you have a negative divided by a negative, they cancel out. that's what we're left with-- actually, let me write this positive 1,6003 a little bit further out, so plus 1,6003. all i did so far is that i just factored out this negative 30. what we can do now is we can add and subtract a term here so that the first three terms here become a perfect square trinomial. that way, we can get into that vertex form. so what do we add and subtract? negative 1403 can be rewritten as 2 times negative 70 over 3, so what you want to add and subtract is negative 70 over 3 squared, or half of negative 1403. you want to add that squared, so plus negative 70 over 3 squared. we can't just add it to one side without doing anything else, so let's also subtract it from that same side-- so, minus negative 70 over 3 squared. we really haven't changed the equation at all, but we're just adding and subtracting the same thing to both sides. what that allows us to do is to make this into a perfect square trinomial-- this is a perfect square trinomial. we can rewrite our profit function-- our profit function is equal to negative 30 times this thing right here, which is a perfect square-- it is s minus 70 over 3 squared. then we have all of this business over here minus minus negative 70 over 3 squared plus 1,600 hundred over 3. the next thing we can do is redistribute this negative 30-- let me scroll down, so we have some space to do this with. we could say price is equal to negative 30 times this expression right here, which is 5 minus 70 over 3-- sorry, not 5 minus, that's an s, and we have to be very careful. that's our selling price s minus 70 over 3 squared, and then that's negative 3 times its first term, and then we have to multiply negative 30 times each of these terms. it's negative 30 times this, and a negative times a negative is a positive-- 30 divided by 3 is 10, so it's going to be plus 10 times negative 70 squared, which we could evaluate if we want. negative 30 times 1,600 over 3 will be negative 10 times 3-- it'll be negative 16,000. we can simplify this. negative 70 squared is what? it's positive 4,900 times 10, and you get 49,000 minus 16,000, which is 33,000. we might as well do that, so this whole thing simplifies to our profit function-- our yearly profit-- is negative 30 times s minus 70 over 3 squared. let me make sure i did that right 7 times 7 is 49, and then you have-- no, it's 4,900, so let me be very clear here. it's 7 times 7 is 4,900, and then times 10 is 49,000. let me make sure i got it-- yes, 49,000 minus 16,000 is 33,000, so plus 33,000. it's just that. when is this thing maximized? if you look right here, this term right here-- this s minus 70 over 3 squared-- is always going to be positive, or it's always going to be non-negative, it could be 0. so when you multiply times a negative number, it's always going to be a negative, so this thing is always going to be non-positive-- it could be equal to 0. so, the profit is going to take its highest value when this whole expression is 0. and when is this whole expression going to be 0? the whole expression is going to be 0 when s is equal to 70 over 3. that's when it equals 0. just so we have a better sense of that, what is 703? that is-- 3 goes into 70, 3 goes into 7 two times, 2 times 3 is 6, bring down it down and get a 10, 3 goes into 10 three times, 3 times 3 is 9, and subtract. you get another 10, so it's 23.3333333-- you can view it that way, it just keeps repeating. or, you could say the ideal selling price is $23.33. so, the ideal selling price, the maximum selling price, the selling price that optimizes our profit is $23.33. when you do sell for $23.33, this is going to be 0, that whole thing is going to be 0, and your profit is going to be $33,000. at that point, your profit is going to be $33,000 for the year.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"webvtt kind captions language en - voiceover so we have this function, f of x, expressed as a rational expression here, or defined with a rational expression. and we are told at each of the following values of x, select whether f has a zero, a vertical asymptote, or a removable discontinuity. and before even looking at the choices, what i am going to do, because you're not going to always going to have these choices here. sometimes you might just have to identify the vertical asymptotes, or the zeros, or the removable discontinuities, is i am going to factor this out. and hopefully, or i'm going to factor the numerator and the denominator to hopefully makes things a little bit more clear. and we are to think about what x values make the numerator and, or the denominator equal to zero. so the numerator, can i factor that? well, let's see. what two numbers, their product is negative 24, and they add to negative two. see, that would be negative six and positive four. so we could write x minus six times x plus four. did i do that right? negative six times four is negative 24. negative six x plus four x is negative two x. yeah, that's right. alright, and now in the denominator, let's see, six times four is 24, six plus four is 10. so we can say, six, x plus six times x plus 4. so let's look at the numerator first. the numerator zero if x is equal to positive six, or x is equal to negative four. the denominator is zero if x is equal to negative six, or x is equal to negative four. so, let's think about it. can we simplify this, what we have up here a little bit? and i, in other words, keep in mind what i just wrote down. well it might be, just jumping at it, you get an x plus four divided by an x plus four, why can't we simplify this expression a little bit? and just write this whole thing, write our original expression as being x minus six over x plus six, where x, if we want it to be algebraically equivalent we have to constrain the domain, where x cannot be equal to negative four. well this is interesting because before, when x equals negative four, we had all this weird zero over zero stuff. well we were able to remove it, and we were able to make it this kind of, this extra condition. and if you were to graph it, it would show up as a little bit of a removable discontinuity. a little bit of a point discontinuity, just one point, where the function is not actually, is actually not defined. so in this situation, and this is typical where there's a thing that you can factor out, it was making the numerator and the denominator equal zero but you can factor that out, so it no longer does it. that's going to be removable discontinuity. so x equals negative four is a removable discontinuity. and once you've factored out all the things that would make it a removable discontinuity, then you can think about what's going to be a zero and what's going to be a vertical asymptote. if it makes, once you've factored out everything that's common to the numerator and the denominator, if of what's left, something makes the numerator equal to zero, well, then it's going to make this whole expression equal to zero and so you're dealing with a zero, so x equals six. six would make the numerator equal to zero. six minus six is zero. so there you're dealing with a zero. and to make the denominator equal to zero, you would get x equals negative six. that would make the denominator equal zero so that's a vertical asymptote. it's called a vertical asymptote because as you approach this value, as approach negative six, either from values smaller than negative six or larger than negative six, the denominator is going to become either very, very, very, it's either going to become a very, very, very, very small positive number or a very, very, very small negative number, so we're going to approach zero either from above or below and so when you divide by that, you're going to get very large positive values or very large negative values. and so your graph does stuff that. so you have a vertical asymptote. it might either do something that or it might do something this, where this is your vertical asymptote, and then when you approach from here, it goes, it bumps up that. so either way, so that's why that's a vertical asymptote. let's do another one. alright, so same drill and before, let, we'll always pause the video and see if you can work it out on your own. let me factor it. so let's see, two numbers, product is negative 32. they're going to have different signs, eight, four. and then we want the large one to be positive since they have to add up to positive four x. so x plus eight times x minus four. yep, i think that's right. and then divided by, this is four times four is 16. four, negative four plus negative four is negative eight so this x minus four times x minus four. now this is really, really interesting because you might say, , i have an x minus four x minus four, maybe, x equals four is a removable discontinuity. and it would have been unless you had, if you didn't have this over here, because x equals four, even after you've factored this. you still can't, the expression, the function, is still not going to be defined when x equals four. and so this function is actually equivalent to x plus eight over x minus 4. i don't have to put that extra little constraint i did before. i don't have to put, i don't have to put this little constraint that describes this removable discontinuity because the constraint is still there, after i've factored out, after i've cancelled out this x minus four with this x minus four. and so here, we've, this is actually an algebraically equivalent expression to this one right over here. and so now, we can think about what the zeros or the vertical asymptotes or the removable discontinuities are going to be. well, something that makes the numerator zero without doing it to the denominator is going to be a zero. and x equals negative eight makes the numerator equal to zero without doing anything to, without making the denominator equal to zero. it would make the denominator to negative 12. so you could literally just evaluate h of negative eight is equal to zero over negative 12, which is equal to zero. so that's why we call it a zero. what about x equals four? well, x equals four is going to make the denominator only equal to zero, so that's going to give us a vertical asymptote. and we're all done.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

if we go back to the origin of earth, and you think about maybe 4.7, 4.6, 4.5 billion years ago, the planet was quite hot. there was a limited number of minerals. there was some carbon, some water. and i think that maybe it's a really simple set of chemistry that we really don't understand. so that means you've got a finite number of elements that are going to react very simply with one another. and out of that mess comes a cell. so literally sand turns into cells. and it seems to happen quick. so what i think i can say with some degree of, i think not certainty, but curiosity, genuine curiosity is that life happened fast. yeah, so when we say fast, this is a pretty surprising fact, and maybe you can actually correct me and elaborate, but it seems most, 70 or 80 of the time that earth has been around, there's been life on it. like some very significant percentage. so when you say fast, the slow part is from single cell or from bacteria to some more complicated organism. it seems that's the slow part. like most of the time that earth has been around, it's been single cell or very basic organisms, a couple of billion years. but yeah, you're right. that's really, i recently kind of revisited our history and saw this. and i was just looking at the timeline. wait a minute. like how did life just spring up so quickly? like really quickly. that makes me think that it really wanted to. like put another way, it's very easy for life to spring. yeah, i agree. i think it's much more inevitable. and i think i try to kind of, not provoke, but try and push chemists to think about this because chemists are central to this problem, right? of understanding the origin of life on earth at least, because we're made of chemistry. but i wonder if the origin of life on a planet or sorry, the emergence of life on planet is as common as the formation of a star. and if you start framing it in that way, it allows you to then look at the universe slightly differently because, and we can get into this i think in quite some detail, but i think to come back to your question, i have little idea of how life got started, but i know it was simple. and i know that the process of selection had to occur before the biology was established. so that selection built the framework from which life kind of grew in complexity and capability and functionality and autonomy. and i think these are all really important words that we can unpack over the next while. can you say all the words again? so you said selection, so natural selection, the original ab testing. and so, and then complexity, and then the degree of autonomy and sophistication, because i think that people misunderstand what life is. some people say that life is a cell, and some people that say that life is a virus or life is an on-off switch. i don't think it's that, life is the universe developing a memory. and the laws of physics and the way, well, there are no laws of physics, physics is just memory free stuff, right? so there's only a finite number of ways you can arrange the fundamental particles to do things. life is the universe developing a memory. so it's sewing a piece of art slowly, and then you can look back at it. so there's a stickiness to life. it's universe doing stuff. and when you say memory, it's , there's a stickiness to a bunch of the stuff it's building together. so you can, in a stable way, trace back the complexity and that tells a coherent story. yeah, and i think, yeah. okay, that's by the way, very poetic. beautiful. life is the universe developing a memory. okay, and then there's autonomy, you said complexity we'll talk about, but it's a really interesting idea that selection preceded biology. yeah, i think. so first of all, what is chemistry? like the sand still count as chemistry? sure, i mean, as a chemist, the card carrying chemist, if i'm allowed a card, i don't know, i don't know what i am most days. what is the card made of? what's the chemical composition of the card? so what is chemistry? well, chemistry is the thing that happens when you bring electrons together and you form bonds. so bonds, or i say to people when they talk about life elsewhere, and i just say, well, there's bonds, there's hope. because bonds allow you to get heterogeneity, they allow you to record those memories, or at least on earth. you could imagine a stanislav lemtri world where you might have life emerging or intelligence emerging before life. that may be something to do on solaris or something, but to get to selection, if atoms can combine and form bonds, those atoms can bond to different elements and those molecules will have different identities and interact with each other differently. and then you can start to have some degree of causation or interaction, and then selection, and then existence. and then you go up the kind of the path of complexity. and so at least on earth, as we know it, there is a sufficient pool of available chemicals to start searching that commentorial space of bonds. so, okay, this is a really interesting question. let's lay it out. so bonds, almost cards. we say there's bonds, there is life, there's intelligence, there's consciousness. and what you just made me realize is those can emerge, or let's put bonds aside, those can emerge in any order. mm-hmm. that's really brilliant. so intelligence can come before life. it's panpsychists believe that consciousness, i guess, comes before life and before intelligence. so consciousness permeates all matter, it's some kind of fabric of reality. okay, so within this framework, you can kind of arrange everything, but you need to have the bonds that precedes everything else. oh, and the other thing is selection. so the mechanism of selection, that could precede, couldn't that precede bonds too? whatever the hell selection is. so i would say that there is an elegant order to it. bonds allow selection, allows the emergence of life, allows the emergence of multicellularity, and then more information processing, building state machines all the way up. however, you could imagine a situation if you had, i don't know, a neutron star or a sun or what, a ferromagnetic loops interacting with one another, and these oscillators building state machines, and these state machines reading something out in the environment. over time, these state machines would be able to literally record what happened in the past and sense what's going on in the present and imagine the future. however, i don't think it's ever gonna be within a human comprehension, that type of life. i wouldn't count it out because whenever you, i know in science, whenever i say something's impossible, i then wake up the next day and say, no, that's actually wrong. i mean, there are some limits, of course. i don't see myself traveling faster than light anytime soon, but- eric weinstein says that's possible, so he will say you're wrong. sure, but i'm an experimentalist as well. so one of my, i have two superpowers. my stupidity, and i don't mean that as a, i'm absolutely completely witless, but i mean my ability to kind of just start again and ask the question and then do it with an experiment. i always wanted to be a theoretician growing up, but i just didn't have the intellectual capability. but i was able to think of experiments in my head i could then do in my lab or when i was a child outside, and then those experiments in my head and then outside reinforced one another. so i think that's a very good way of kind of grounding the science, right? well, that's a nice way to think about theoreticians is they're just people who run experiments in their head. i mean, that's exactly what einstein did, right? but you're also capable of doing that in the head, in your head, inside your head and in the real world and the connection between the two is when you first discovered your superpower of stupidity. i it. okay, what's the second superpower? your accent or? well, i don't know. i , i am genuinely curious. so my curious, so i have, you know, everybody ego problems, but my curiosity is bigger than my ego. so as long as that happens, i can, i can, i can. that's awesome. that is so powerful. you're just dropping some powerful lines. so curiosity is bigger than ego. that's something i have to think about because you always struggle about the role of ego in life. and that's, that's so nice to think about. don't think about the size of ego, the absolute size of ego. think about the relative size of ego to the other, the other horse is pulling at you. and if the curiosity one is bigger, then ego will do just fine and make you fun to talk to. anyway, so those are the two superpowers. how do those connect to natural selection or in selection and bonds? and i forgot already life and consciousness. so we're going back to selection in the universe and origin of life on earth. i mean, selection is a, i'm convinced that selection is a force in the universe. so not me, not a fundamental force, but a, but a directing, but it is a directing force because existence, although existence appears to be the default, the existence of what, why does, and we can get to this later, i think, but it's amazing that the discrete things exist. and you know, you see this cup, it's not the sexiest cup in the world, but it's pretty functional. this cup, the complexity of this cup isn't just in the object, it is literally the lineage of people making cups and recognizing that, seeing that in their head, making an abstraction of a cup, and then making a different one. so i wonder how many billions of cups have, you know, come before this one. and that's the process of selection and existence. and the only reason the cup is still used is quite useful. i the handle, you know, it's convenient so i don't die, i don't get hydration. and so i think we are missing something fundamental in the universe about selection. and i think what biology is, is a selection amplifier, and that this is where autonomy comes in. and actually i think that how humanity is gonna humans and autonomous robots, or whatever we're gonna call them in the future, we'll supercharge that even further. so selection is happening in the universe, but if you look in the asteroid belt selection, if objects are being kicked in and out the asteroid belt, those trajectories are quite complex. you don't really look at that as productive selection because it's not doing anything to improve its function. but is it? the asteroid belt has existed for some time. so there is some selection going on, but the functionality is somewhat limited. on earth, at the formation of earth, interaction of chemicals and molecules in the environment gave selection and then things could happen. cause you could think about in chemistry, we can have an infinite number of reactions happen, but they don't all, all the reactions are allowed to happen, don't happen. why? because there are energy barriers. so there must be some things called catalysts out there, or there are bits of minerals that when two molecules get together on that mineral, it lowers the energy barrier for the reaction. and so the reaction is promoted. so suddenly you get one reaction over another of series of possibilities occurring that makes a particular molecule. and this keeps happening in steps. and before you know it, almost these waves as discrete reactions work together and you start to build a machinery that is run by existence. so as you go forward in time, the fact that the molecules, the bonds are getting, there are more bonds in a molecule, there's more function, there's more capability for this molecule to interact with other molecules to redirect them. it's a series of little, and i don't want to use this term too much, but it's almost thinking about the simplest von neumann constructor, that's the simplest molecule that could build a more complicated molecule to build a more complicated molecule. and before you know it, when that more complicated molecule can act on the causal chain that's produced itself and change it, suddenly you start to get towards some kind of autonomy. and that's where life, i think, emerges in earnest. every single word in the past few paragraphs, let's break those apart. but who's von neumann, what's the constructor, the closing of the loop that you're talking about, the molecule that starts becoming, i think you said the smallest von neumann constructor, the smallest, the minimal. so what do all those things mean, and what are we supposed to imagine when we think about the smallest von neumann constructor? so john von neumann is a real hero, actually, not just me, but many people, i think, computer science and physics. he was an incredible intellect, who probably solved a lot of the problems that we're working on today, i just forgot to write them down. and i'm not sure if it's john von neumann or johnny, as i think his friends called him, but i think he was hungarian, mathematician, came to the us, and basically was involved in the manhattan project and developing computation, and came up with all sorts of ideas, and i think he was one of the first people to come up with cellular automata. really, i didn't know this whole fact. i think so, i think so. well, anyway, if he didn't come up with it, he probably did come up with it and didn't write it down. there was a couple of people who did at the same time, and then conway obviously took it on, and then wolfram loves cas, there is his fabric of the universe. and what i think he imagined was that he wasn't satisfied, and this may be incorrect recollection, but a lot of what i say is gonna be kind of, just way out of my- you're just part of the universe, creating its memory, designing- exactly, yeah, rewriting history. exactly, imperfectly. so, but what i mean is, i think he liked this idea of thinking about how could a turing machine literally build itself without a turing machine, right? it's literally how did state machines emerge, and i think that von neumann constructors, he wanted to conceive of a minimal thing, autonomous, that could build itself, and what would those rules look in the world? and that's what a von neumann kind of constructor looked , it's a minimal hypothetical object that could build itself, self-replicate. and i'm really fascinated by that, because i think that, although it's probably not exactly what happened, it's a nice model, because as chemists, if we could go back to the origin of life and think about what is a minimal machine that can get structured randomly, so with no prime mover, with no architect, it assembles through just existence, so random stuff bumping in together, and you make this first molecule, so you have molecule a, and molecule a interacts with another random molecule b, and they get together, and they realize by working together, they can make more of themselves, but then they realize they can mutate, so they can make ab prime, so ab prime's different to ab, and then ab prime can then act back where a and b were being created, and slightly nudge that causal chain, and make ab prime more evolvable, or learn more, so that's the closing the loop part. closing the loop part, got it. it feels the mutation part is not that difficult. it feels the difficult part is just creating a copy of yourself as step one. that seems one of the greatest inventions in the history of the universe, is the first molecule that figured out, holy shit, i can create a copy of myself. how hard is that? i think it's really, really easy. okay, i did not expect that. i think it's really, really easy. well, let's take a step back. i think replicating molecules are rare, but if you say, i think i was saying on, i probably got into trouble on twitter the other day, so i was trying to work this. there's about more than 18 mils of water in there, so one mole of water, 6.022 times 10 to the 23 molecules. that's about the number of stars in the universe, i think, of the order. so there's three universe worth. but between one and- oh, did somebody correct you on twitter? yeah, as if, i'm always being corrected. it's a great fact, but there's a lot of molecules in the water, and so there's a lot of, so although it's for you and me, really hard to conceive of, if existence is not the default for a long period of time, because what happens is the molecules get degraded. so much of the possibilities in the universe are just broken back into atoms. so you have this kind of destruction of the molecules for our chemical reactions. so you only need one or two molecules to become good at copying themselves, for them suddenly to then take resources in the pool and start to grow. and so then replication, actually over time, when you have bonds, i think is much simpler and much easier. and i even found this in my lab years ago. i had one of the reasons i started doing inorganic chemistry and making rust, making a bit of rust based on a thing called molybdenum, molybdenum oxide. is this molybdenum oxide? very simple, but when you add acid to it and some electrons, they make these molecules you just cannot possibly imagine would be constructed, big gigantic wheels of 154 molybdenum atoms in a wheel, or icosadodecahedron 132 molybdenum atoms, all in the same pot. and i realized when i, and i just finished experiments two years ago, i've just published a couple of papers on this, that there actually, there is a random small molecule with 12 atoms in it that can form randomly, but it happens to template its own production. and then by chance, it templates the ring, just an accident, just , just an absolute accident. and that ring also helps make the small 12 mer. and so you have what's called an autocatalytic set, where a makes b and b helps make a and vice versa. and you then make this loop. so it's a bit these, they all work in synergy to make this chain of events that grow. and it doesn't take a very sophisticated model to show that if you have these objects are competing and then collaborating to help one another build, they just grow out of the mess. and although they seem improbable, they are improbable, in fact impossible in one step. there's multiple steps. this is when the blind, people look at the blind watchmaker argument when you talk about how could a watch suddenly spontaneously emerge. well, it doesn't. it's a lineage of watches and cruder devices that are bootstrapped onto one another. right. so it's very improbable, but once you get that little discovery, with the wheel and fire, it just gets explodes in, because it's so successful, it explodes. it's basically selection. so this templating mechanism that allows you to have a little blueprint for yourself, how you go through different procedures is to build copies of yourself. so in chemistry somehow it's possible to imagine that that kind of thing is easy to spring up. in more complex organisms, it feels a different thing and much more complicated. we're having multiple abstractions of the birds and the bees conversation here, but with human, sorry, with complex organisms, it feels difficult to have reproduction to, that's gonna get clipped out, i'm gonna make fun of that. it's difficult to develop this idea of making copies of yourself or no, because that seems a magical idea for life to, wow, that feels very necessary for what selection is, for what evolution is, but then if selection precedes all of this, then maybe these are just echoes of the selecting mechanism at different scales. yeah, that's exactly it. so selection is the default in the universe, if you want to, and what happens is that life, the solution that life has got on earth, life on earth, biology on earth, is unique to earth, we can talk about that, and that was really hard fought for, but that is the solution that works on earth, the ribosome, the fundamental machine that is responsible for every cell on earth, of wherever it is in the kingdom of life, that is an incredibly complex object, but it was evolved over time, and it wasn't involved in a vacuum, and i think that once we understand that selection can occur without the ribosome, but what the ribosome does, it's a phase transition in replication, and i think that that, and also technology, that is probably much easier to get to than we think. why do you put the ribosome as a central part of living organisms on earth? it basically is a combination of two different polymer systems, so rna and peptides, so the rna world, if you , gets transmitted and builds proteins, and the proteins are responsible for all the catalysis, the majority of the catalysis that goes on in the cell. no ribosome, no proteins, no decoding, no evolution. so ribosome is looking at the action, so you don't put the rna itself as the critical thing, information, you put action as the most important thing. i think the actual molecules that we have in biology right now are entirely contingent on the history of life on earth. there are so many possible solutions, and this is where chemistry got itself into, origin of life chemistry gets itself into a bit of a trap. yeah, let me interrupt you there. you've tweeted, you're gonna get, i'm gonna cite your tweets it's shakespeare. okay. it's surprising you haven't gotten canceled on twitter yet. your brilliance once again saves you. i'm just kidding. there's, you to have a little bit of fun on twitter. you've tweeted that, quote, origin of life research is a scam. so if this is shakespeare, can we analyze this word? why is the origin of life research a scam? aren't you kind of doing origin of life research? okay, it was tongue in cheek, but yeah, i think, and i meant it as tongue in cheek. i am, i'm not doing the origin of life research. i'm trying to make artificial life. and i also want to bound the likelihood of the origin of life on earth, but more importantly to find origin of life elsewhere. but let me directly address the tweet. there are many, many good chemists out there doing origin of life research, but i want to nudge them. and i think they're brilliant. like there's no question, the chemistry they are doing, their motivation is great. so what i meant by that tweet is saying that maybe they're making assumptions about saying, if only i could make this particular type of molecule, say this rna molecule or this phosphodiester or this other molecule, it's going to somehow unlock the origin of life. and i think that origin of life has been looking at this for a very long time. and whilst i think it's brilliant to work out how you can get to those molecules, i think that chemistry and chemists doing origin of life could be nudged into doing something even more profound. and so the argument i'm making, it's a bit right now, let's say, i don't know, the first tesla that makes its way to, i don't know, into a new country in the world. let's say there's a country x that has never had a tesla before and they get the tesla. russia. and they take the tesla, and what they do is they take the tesla apart and say, we want to find the origin of cars in the universe and say, okay, how did this form and how did this form? and they just randomly keep making till they make the door, they make the wheel, they make the steering column and all this stuff. and they say, , that's the route. that's the way cars emerged on earth. but actually we know that there's a causal chain of cars going right back to henry ford and the horson carriage. and before that maybe, where people were using wheels. and i think that obsession with the identities that we see in biology right now are giving us a false sense of security about what we're looking for. and i think the origin of life chemistry is in danger of not making the progress that it deserves because the chemists are doing this. the field is exploding right now. there's amazing people out there. young and old doing this. and there's deservedly so more money going in. i used to complain there's more money being spent searching for the higgs boson that we know exists and the origin of life. why is that? we understand the origin of life. we're gonna actually work out what life is. we're gonna be outbound the likelihood of finding life elsewhere in the universe. and most important for us, we are gonna know or have a good idea of what the future of humanity looks . we need to understand that although we're precious, we're not the only life forms in the universe. or that's my very strong impression. i have no data for that. it's just right now a belief. and i want to turn that belief into a more than a belief by experimentation. but coming back to the scam, the scam is if we just make this rna, we've got this fluke event, we know how that's simple. let's make this phosphodiester or let's make atp or adp. we've got that part nailed. let's now make this other molecule, another molecule. and how many molecules are gonna be enough? and then the reason i say this is when you go back to craig venter, when he invented his life form, cyndia, this minimal plasma, it's a myoplasma, something i don't know the name of it, but he made this wonderful cell and said, i've invented life. not quite. he facsimile-ed the genome from this entity and made it in the lab or the dna, but he didn't make the cell. he had to take an existing cell that has a causal chain going all the way back to luca. and he showed when he took out the gene, the genes, and put in his genes, synthesized, the cell could boot up. but it's remarkable that he could not make a cell from scratch. and even now today, synthetic biologists cannot make a cell from scratch because there's some contingent information embodied outside the genome in the cell. and that is just incredible. so there's lots of layers to the scam. well, let me then ask the question, how can we create life in the lab from scratch? what have been the most promising attempts at creating life in the lab from scratch? has anyone actually been able to do it? do you think anyone will be able to do it in the near future if they haven't already? can, yeah, i think that nobody has made life in the lab from scratch. lots of people would argue that they have made progress. craig venter, i think the synthesis of a synthetic genome milestone in human achievement, brilliant. yeah, can we just walk back and say, what would you say from your perspective, one of the world experts in exactly this area, what does it mean to create life from scratch? where if you sit back, whether you do it or somebody else does it, it's , damn, this is, we just created life. well, i can tell you what i would expect, i would to be able to do, is to go from sand to cells in my lab. can you explain what sand is? yeah, just inorganic stuff. like basically, so sand is just silicon oxide with some other ions in it. maybe some inorganic carbon, some carbonates, just basically clearly dead stuff that you could just grind rocks into sand. and it would be what, in a kind of vacuum so they could remove anything else that could possibly be a shadow of life that can assist in the chemical. you could do that, you could insist and say, look, i'm gonna take, and not just inorganic, i want some more, i wanna cheat and have some organic, but i want inorganic organic, and i'll explain the play on words in a moment. so i would to basically put into a world, let's say a completely synthetic world, if you , a closed world, put some inorganic materials and just literally add some energy in some form, be it lightning or heat, uv light, and run this thing in cycles over time and let it solve the search problem. so i see the origin of life as a search problem in chemical space. and then i would wait, literally wait for a life form to crawl out of the test tube. that's a joke i tell my group. literally wait for a very, don't worry, it's gonna be very feeble, it's not gonna take over the world. there's ways of ethically containing it. famous last words. indeed, indeed, indeed. you know this is being recorded, right? it will not make you look good once it crawls out of the lab and destroys all of human civilization, but yes. but there is a very good things you can do to prevent that. for instance, if you put stuff in your world, which isn't earth abundant. so let's say we make life based on molybdenum and it escapes, it would die immediately because there's not enough molybdenum in the environment. so we can put in, we can do responsible life. or as i fantasized with my research group on our way day, that would go in, i think it's actually morally, if we don't find, until humanity finds life in the universe, this is going on a tangent, it's our moral obligation to make origin of life bombs, identify dead planets and bomb them with our origin of life machines and make them alive. i think it is our moral obligation to do that. some people might argue with me about that, but i think that we need more life in the universe. and then we kind of forget we did it and then come back. and then- so where did you come from? but coming back to the, what i'd expect. so i just say- father, are you back? i think this is once again a rick and morty episode. it's definitely all rick and morty all the way down. so i imagine we have this pristine experiment and everything is sanitized and we put in inorganic materials and we have cycles, whether day, night cycles, up, down, whatever. and we look for evidence of replication and evolution over time. and that's what the experiment should be. now, are there people doing this in the world right now? there are a couple of, there's some really good groups doing this. there's some really interesting scientists doing this around the world. they're kind of perhaps too much associated with the scam. so, and so they're using molecules that were already invented by biology. so there's a bit of replication built in, but i still think the work they're doing is amazing. but i would people to be a bit freer and say, let's just basically shake a load of sand in a box and wait for life to come out because that's what happened on earth. and so that we have to understand that. now, how would i know i've been successful? well, because i'm not obsessing with what molecules are in life now, i would wager a vast quantity of money. i'm not very rich, so it'd just be a few dollars, but for me, the solution space will be different. so the genetic material will be not rna. the proteins will not be what we think. the solutions will be just completely different. and it might be, and it will be very feeble because that's the other thing we should be able to show fairly robustly that even if i did make or someone did make a new life form in the lab, it would be so poor that it's not gonna leap out. it is the fear about making a lethal life form in the lab from scratch is similar to us imagining that we're gonna make the terminator, boston dynamics tomorrow. it's simply not. and the problem is we don't communicate that properly. i know you yourself, you explain this very well. there is not the ai catastrophe coming. we're very far away from that. that doesn't mean we should ignore it. same with the origin of life catastrophe. it's not coming anytime soon. we shouldn't ignore it, but we shouldn't let that fear stop us from doing those experiments. but this is a much, much longer discussion because there's a lot of details there. i would say there's potentials for catastrophic events to happen in much dumber ways. within an ai space, there's a lot of ways to create, social networks are creating a kind of accelerated set of events that we might not be able to control. the social network, the virality in the digital space can create mass movements of ideas that can then, if times are tough, create military conflict and all those kinds of things. but that's not super intelligent ai. that's an interesting at scale application of ai. if you look at viruses, viruses are pretty dumb, but at scale, their application is pretty detrimental. and so origin of life, much all of the kind of virology, the very contentious word of gain of function research and virology, sort of research on viruses, messing with them genetically, that can create a lot of problems if not done well. so we have to be very cautious. so there's a kind of, whenever you're ultra cautious about stuff in ai or in virology and biology, it borders on cynicism, i would say, where it's everything we do is going to turn out to be destructive and terrible, so i'm just going to sit here and do nothing. okay, that's a possible solution, except for the fact that somebody's going to do it. it's science and technology progresses, so we have to do it in an ethical way, in a good way, considering in a transparent way, in an open way, considering all the possible positive trajectories that could be taken and making sure as much as possible that we walk those trajectories. so yeah, i don't think terminator is coming, but a totally unexpected version of terminator may be around the corner. yeah, it might be here already. yeah, so i agree with that. and so going back to the origin of life discussion, i think that in synthetic biology right now, we have to be very careful about how we edit genomes and edit synthetic biology to do things. so that's kind of, that's where things might go wrong in the same way as twitter turning ourselves into kind of strange scale effects. i would love origin of life research or artificial life research to get to the point where we have those worries, because that's why i think we're just so far away from that. we are just, you know, right now, i think there are two really important angles. there is the origin of life people, researchers who are faithfully working on this and trying to make those molecules, the scan molecules i talk about. and then there are people on the creationist side who are saying, look, the fact you can't make these molecules and you can't make a cell means that evolution isn't true and all this other stuff. gotcha. yeah, and so, and i find that really frustrating because actually the origin of life research is all working in good faith, right? yes. and so what i'm trying to do is give origin of life research a little bit more of an open context. and one of the things i think is important, i really want to make a new life form in my lifetime. i really want to prove that life is a general phenomena, a bit gravity in the universe, because i think that's gonna be really important for humanity's global psychological state, meaning going forward. that's beautifully put. so one, it will help us understand ourselves. so that's useful for science, but two, it gives us a kind of hope, if not an awe at all the huge amounts of alien civilizations that are out there. if you can build life and understand just how easy it is to build life, then that's just as good, if not much better, than discovering life on another planet. yeah. it's, i mean, it's cheaper. it's much cheaper and much easier and probably much more conclusive because once you're able to create life, you said, it's a search problem that there's probably a lot of different ways to do it. so once you create the, once you find the first solution, you probably have all the right methodology for finding all kinds of other solutions. yeah, and wouldn't it be great if we could find a solution? i mean, it's probably a bit late for, i mean, i worry about climate change, but i'm not that worried about climate change. and i think one day you could think about, could we engineer a new type of life form that could basically, and i don't want to do this, and i don't think we should do this necessarily, but it's a good thought experiment that would perhaps take co2 out of the atmosphere or an intermediate life form. so it's not quite alive. it's almost an add-on that we can, with a time-dependent add-on, you could give to say cyanobacteria in the ocean or to maybe to wheat and say, right, we're just gonna, we're gonna fix a bit more co2 and we're gonna work out how much we need to fix to basically save the climate. and we're gonna use evolutionary principles to basically get there. what worries me is that biology has had a few billion years to find a solution for co2 fixation. it hasn't really done, the solution isn't brilliant for our needs, but biology wasn't thinking about our needs. biology was thinking about biology's needs. but i think if we can do, as you say, make life in the lab, then suddenly we don't need to go to everywhere and conclusively prove it. i think we make life in the lab. we look at the extent of life in the solar system, how far did earth life get? probably we're all martians, probably life got going on mars, the chemistry on mars seeded earth. that might have been a legitimate way to kind of truncate the surface. but in the outer solar system, we might have completely different life forms on enceladus, on europa and titan. and that would be a cool thing because- okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. did you just say that you think in terms of likelihood, life started on mars, statistically speaking, life started on mars and seeded earth? it could be possible because life was, so mars was habitable for the type of life that we have right now, type of chemistry before earth. so it seems to me that mars got searching doing chemistry. and- so it started way before. yeah, and so they had a few more replicators and some other stuff. and if those replicators got ejected from mars and landed on earth, and earth would be , i don't need to start again. thanks. thanks for that. and then it just carried on. so i'm not going, i think we will find evidence of life on mars, either life we put there by mistake, contamination, or actually life, the earliest remnants of life. and that would be really exciting. it's a really good reason to go there. but i think it's more unlikely because of the gravitational situation in the solar system, if we find life in the outer solar system- titan and all that, that would be its own thing. exactly. wow, that would be so cool. if we go to mars and we find life that looks a hell of a lot similar to earth life, and then we'll go to titan and all those weird moons with the ices and the volcanoes and all that kind of stuff. and then we find there something that looks, i don't know, way weirder. some other, some non-rna type of situation. or we might find almost life, in the pre-biodic chemical space. and i think there are four types of exoplanets we can go look for, right? because when jwst goes up and touch wood, it goes up and everything's fine. when we look at a star, well, we know statistically, most stars have planets around them. what type of planet are they? are they gonna be dead? are they gonna be just pre-biodic origin of life coming? so are they gonna be technological? and so we have intelligence on them. and will they have died? so from, had life on them, but gone. those are the four states of- they're four, and so, and suddenly, it's a bit i want to classify planets the way we classify stars. and i think that in terms of rather than having this, , we've found methane, there's evidence of life. we found oxygen, that's the evidence of life. we found whatever molecule marker, and start to then frame things a little bit more. as those four states. which by the way, you're just saying four, but there could be a before the dead, there could be other states that we humans can't even conceive of. just pre-biotic, almost alive, got the possibility to come alive. i think- but there could be a post-technological. whatever we think of as technology, that could be pre-conscious. like, where we all meld into one super intelligent conscious or some weird thing that naturally happens. over time. yeah, yeah, i mean, i think that all bets are on them. the metaverse. yeah, we are. in the face. we join into a virtual metaverse, and start creating, which is kind of an interesting idea, almost arbitrary number of copies of each other, much more quickly, to mess with different ideas. i can create a thousand copies of lex, every possible version of lex, and then just see, and then i just have them argue with each other, and until in the space of ideas, and see who wins out. how could that possibly go wrong? but anyway, especially in this digital space, where you can start exploring with ais mixed in, you can start engineering arbitrary intelligences. you can start playing in the space of ideas, which might move us into a world that looks very different than a biological world. like our current world, the technology, is still very much tied to our biology. we might move past that completely. oh, definitely, we definitely will. we definitely, because that could be another phase then. sure. because then you- but i did say technological, so i think i agree with you. i think, so you can have, let's get this right. so dead world, no prospect of alive. prebiotic world, life emerging, living, and technological. and you probably, and the dead one, you probably won't be able to tell between the dead never been alive and the dead one, maybe you've got some artifacts, and maybe there's five. there's probably not more than five. and i think the technological one could have life on it still, but it might just have exceeded. because one way that life might survive on earth is if we can work out how to deal with the coming, the real climate change that comes when the sun expands. there might be a way to survive that. but yeah, i think that we need to start thinking statistically when it comes to looking for life in the universe. let me ask you then sort of statistically, how many alien civilizations are out there in those four phases that you're talking about? when you look up to the stars, and you're sipping on some wine, and talking to other people with british accents about something intelligent, intellectual, i'm sure. do you think there's a lot of alien civilizations looking back at us and wondering the same? my romantic view of the universe is really taking loans from my logical self. so what i'm saying is i have no idea. but having said that, there is no reason to suppose that life is as hard as we first thought it was. and so if we just take earth as a marker, and if i think that life is a much more general phenomena than just our biology, then i think the universe is full of life. and the reason for the fermi paradox is not that they're not out there, it's just that we can't interact with other life forms because they're so different. and i'm not saying that they're necessarily as depicted in arrival or other, you know, i'm just saying that perhaps there are very few universal facts in the universe, and maybe that is not, it's quite hard, our technologies are quite divergent. and so i think that it's very hard to know how we're gonna interact with alien life. you think there's a lot of kinds of life that's possible. i guess that was the intuition. yeah. you provided that the way biology itself, but even this particular kinds of biology that we have on earth is something that is just one sample of nearly infinite number of other possible complex, autonomous self-replicating type of things that could be possible. and so we're almost unable to see the alternative versions of us. i mean, we'll still be able to detect them, we'll still be able to interact with them, we'll still be able to, , which, what's exactly is lost in translation? why can't we see them? why can't we talk to them? because i too have a sense, you put it way more poetically, but it seems both statistically and sort of romantically, it feels the universe should be teaming with life, super intelligent life. and i just, i sit there and the fermi paradox is very, it's felt very distinctly by me when i look up at the stars because it's , it's the same way i feel when i'm driving through new jersey and listening to bruce springsteen and feel quite sad. it's lucy kay talks about pulling off to the side of the road and just weeping a little bit. i'm almost wondering , hey, why aren't you talking to us? it feels lonely. it feels lonely because it feels they're out there. i think that there are a number of answers to that. i think the fermi paradox is perhaps based on the assumption that if life did emerge in the universe, it would be similar to our life and there's only one solution. and i think that what we've got to start to do is go out and look for selection detection rather than an evolution detection rather than life detection. and i think that once we start to do that, we might start to see really interesting things. and we haven't been doing this for very long. and we are living in an expanding universe. so that makes the problem a little bit harder. everybody's always leaving distance-wise. i'm very optimistic that we will, well, i don't know. there are two movies that came out within six months of one another, ad astra and cosmos. ad astra, they're very expensive blockbuster with brad pitt in it and saying there is no life and it's all, we've got to, life on earth has more pressures than cosmos, which is a uk production, which basically aliens came and visited earth one day and they were discovered in the uk. it was quite, it's a fun film. but i really loved those two films. and at the same time, those films, at the time those films are coming out, i was working on a paper, a life detection paper. and i found it was so hard to publish this paper. and it was almost as depressed, i got so depressed trying to get this science out there that i felt the depression of the film in ad astra, life is, there's no life elsewhere in the universe. and, but i'm incredibly optimistic that i think we will find life in the universe, firm evidence of life. and it will have to start on earth, making life on earth and surprising us. we have to surprise ourselves and make non-biological life on earth. and then people say, well, you made this life on earth, therefore you're part of the causal chain of that. and that might be true, but if i can show how i'm able to do it with very little cheating or very little information inputs, just creating a model planet, some description, and watching life emerge, then i think that we will be even to persuade even the hardest critic that it's possible. now, with regards to the fermi paradox, i think that we might crush that with the jwst. it's basically, if i recall correctly, the mirror is about 10 times the size of the hubble that we're gonna be able to do spectroscopy, look at colors of exoplanets, i think. not brilliantly, but we'll be able to start to classify them and we'll start to get a real feel for what's going on in the universe on these exoplanets. because it's only in the last few decades, i think, maybe even last decade, that we even came to recognize that exoplanets even are common. and i think that that gives us a lot of optimism that life is gonna be out there. but i think we have to start framing, we have to start preparing the fact that biology is only one solution. i can tell you with confidence that biology on earth does not exist anywhere else in the universe. we are absolutely unique. well, okay, i love the confidence, but where does that confidence come from? chemistry, how many options does chemistry really have? many, that's the point. and the thing is, this is where the origin of life scam comes in, is that people don't count, they don't count the numbers. so if biology, as you find on earth, is common everywhere, then there's something really weird going on that basically written in the quantum mechanics, there's some kind of, these bonds must form over these bonds and this catalyst must form over this catalyst when they're all quite equal. life is contingent. the origin of life on earth was contingent upon the chemistry available at the origin of life on earth. so that means if we want to find other earth- worlds, we look for the same kind of rocky world, we might look in the same zone as earth and we might expect reasonably to find biological- stuff going on. that would be a reasonable hypothesis, but it won't be the same, it can't be. it's saying, i don't believe in magic, that's why i'm sure. i just don't believe in magic, i believe in statistics and i can do experiments. and so i won't get the same, exactly the same sequence of events, i'll get something different. and so there is tiktok elsewhere in the universe, but it's not the same as our tiktok, right? that's what i mean. which aspect of it is not the same? well, i just think, so what is tiktok? tiktok is a social media where people upload videos, right, silly videos. so i guess there might be- well, there's humor, there's attention, there's ability to process, there's ability for intelligent organisms to collaborate on ideas and find humor in ideas and play with those ideas, make them viral memes. humor seems to be kind of fundamental to the human experience. and i think that that's a really interesting question we can ask, is humor a fundamental thing in the universe? i think maybe it will be, right? in terms of, you think about in a game theoretic sense, humor, the emergence of humor serves a role in our game engine. and so if selection is fundamental in the universe, then so is humor. well, i actually don't know exactly what role humor serves. maybe it's , from a chemical perspective, it's a catalyst for, i guess it's for several purposes. one is the catalyst for spreading ideas on the internet. that's modern humor. but humor is also a good way to deal with the difficulty of life. it's a kind of valve, release valve for suffering. like throughout human history, life has been really hard. and for the people that i have known in my life who've lived through some really difficult things, humor is part of how they deal with that. yeah. because it's usually dark humor. but yeah, it's interesting. i don't know exactly sort of what's the more mathematically general way to formulate what the hell is humor? and what humor does it serve? but i still, we're kind of joking here, but it's a counterintuitive idea to me to think that life elsewhere in the universe is very different than life on earth. and also, all of each instantiation of life is likely very different from each other. yeah. like maybe there's a few clusters of similar life, but it's much more likely is what you're saying. to me, it's a kind of novel thought. i'm not sure what to do with it. but you're saying that it's more common to be a weird odd cast in the full spectrum of life than it is to be in some usual cluster. so every instantiation of a kind of chemistry that results in complexity that's autonomous and self-replicating however the hell you define life, that is going to be very different every time. i don't know. it feels a selection is a fundamental kind of directed force in the universe. won't selection result in a few pockets of interesting complexities? i mean, yeah. if we ran earth over again, over and over and over, you're saying it's going to come up that there's not going to be elephants every time? yeah, i don't think so. i think that there will be similarities. and i think we don't know enough about how selection is globally works. but it might be that the elephant, the emergence of elephants was wired into the history of earth in some way, the gravitational force, how evolution was going, cambrian explosions, blah, blah, blah, the emergence of mammals. but i just don't know enough about the contingency, the variability. all i do know is you count the number of bits of information required to make an element, sorry, an elephant and think about the causal chain that provide the lineage of elephants going all the way back to luca, there's a huge scope for divergence. yeah, but just you said, with chemistry and selection, the things that result in self-replicating chemistry and self-replicating organisms, those are extremely unlikely, as you're saying, but once they're successful, they multiply. so , it might be a tiny subset of all things that are possible in the universe, chemically speaking, it might be a very tiny subset is actually successful at creating elephants. or elephant- or slash human- creatures. well, there's two different questions. there's the first one, if we were to reset earth and to start again. at the different phases, sorry to keep interrupting. yeah, no, if we restart earth and start again, say we could go back to the beginning and do the experiment or have a number of earths, how similar would biology be? i would say that there would be broad similarities, but the emergence of mammals is not a given unless we're gonna throw an asteroid at each planet at each time and try and faithfully reproduce what happened. then there's the other thing about when you go to another earth- planet elsewhere, maybe there's a different ratio, particular elements, maybe there's the bombardment at the beginning of the planet was quicker or longer than earth. and i just don't have enough information there. what i do know is that the complexity of the story of life on earth gives us lots of scope for variation. and i just don't think it's a reasonable mathematical assumption to think that life on earth that happened again would be same as what we have now. okay, but you've also extended that to say that we might, as an explanation for the fermi paradox, that that means we're not able to interact with them. or that's an explanation for why we haven't, at scale, heard from aliens is... well, right now. they're different than us. we've only been looking for, say, 70, 80 years. so i think that the reason we have not found aliens yet is that we haven't worked out what life is. no, but the aliens have worked that out, surely. statistically speaking, there must be a large number of aliens that are way ahead of us on this whole life question. unless there's something about this stage of intellectual evolution that often quickly results in nuclear war and destroys itself. there's something in this process that eventually, i don't know, crystallizes the complexity and it stops, either dies or stops developing. but most likely, they already figured it out. and why aren't they contacting us? there's some grad student somewhere wants to study a new green planet. maybe they have. i mean, maybe, i don't have a coherent answer to your question other than to say that, if there are other aliens out there and they're far more advanced, they might be in contact with each other. and they might also, we might be at a point where, what i'm saying quite critically is it takes two to talk. so the aliens might be there, but if we don't have the ability to recognize them and talk to them, then the aliens aren't going to want to talk to us. and i think that's a critical point that probably, if that's a filter, there needs to be an ability for one to communicate with the other. and we need to know what life is before we do that. so we haven't qualified to even join the club to have a talk. well, i think they still want to teach us how to talk. but my worry is that, or i think they would want to teach us how to talk you do when you meet it. like when you even meet, i was going to say child, but that's a human species. i mean an ant. you want to try to communicate with them through whatever devices you can, given what an ant is . i just, i worry mostly about that humans are just too close-minded or don't have the right tools. no, i'm going to push back on this quite significantly. i would say because we don't understand what life is, and because we don't understand how life emerged in the universe, we don't understand the physics that gave rise to life. yeah, and that means our description, fundamental description, i'm way out of my pay grade, even further out, but i'll say it anyway, because i think it's a fun- you don't get paid much anyway, as you said earlier. so i would say that we, because we don't understand the universe yet, we do not understand how the universe spat out life. and we don't know what life is. and i think that until we understand that, it is going to limit our ability to even, we don't qualify to talk to the aliens. so i'm going to say that they might be there, but we just, i'm not going to say that i believe in inter-dimensional aliens being present in this room. yeah, but i think you're just being self-critical, we don't qualify. i think the fact that we don't qualify qualifies us. we're interesting in our innocence. no, i'm saying that because we don't understand causal chains and the way that information is propagated in the universe, and we don't understand what replication is yet, and we don't understand how life emerged, i think that we would not recognize aliens. and if someone doesn't recognize you, you wouldn't go and talk to it. you don't go and talk to ants. you don't go and talk to birds, or maybe some birds you do, right? because you can, there's just enough cognition. so i'm saying because we don't have enough, our cognitive abilities are not yet where they need to be, we probably aren't even communicating with them. so you don't agree with the dating strategy of playing hard to get? because us humans, that seems to attract us. within a species, that's fine, but i think we don't actually have abstraction. no, actually, i think in this talk, in this conversation, you've helped me crystallize something that i think has been troubling me for a long time with the thermoparadox. i'm pretty sure that a reasonable avenue is to say that you would not go and talk to your cat about calculus, right? but i would still pet it. sure, but i'm not talking about petting a cat. so the analogy is that the aliens are not going to talk to us because we, and i'm using calculus as an analogy for abstraction, because we lack the layer, the fundamental layer of understanding what life is and what the universe is in our reality, that it would be so counterproductive interacting with intelligent alien species that it would cause more angst for human race. but they don't care, okay. they gotta be self-interested, so they'll probably, they more care about, is it interesting for them? maybe they, i mean, surely there's a way to pet the cat in this analogy, because even if we lack complete understanding, it must be a very frustrating experience for other kinds of intelligence to communicate with us. still, there must be a way to interact with us, perturb the system in interesting ways to see what these creatures do. we might actually find the answer, i mean, again, at my pay grade, in a simulation of the earth, or say, let's say a simulation where we allow an intelligent ai to emerge, right? and that ai, we then give it, the objective is to be curious, interact with other intelligence in its universe. and then we might find the parameters required for that ai to work with. and i think you'll find if the ai will not talk to other ais that don't share the ability to abstract to the level of the ai, because it's just a cat, and are you gonna travel 20 light years to go and pet a cat? so not because of the inability to do so, but because of boredom. it's more interested, it will start talking to, it will spend most, it will spend a majority of its time talking to other ai systems that can at least somewhat understand it, it's much more fun. it's a bit , do we know that plants are conscious? well, plants aren't conscious in the way we typically think, but we don't talk to them, they could be, right? yeah, but there's a lot of people on earth who gardening. there's always going to be a weird- they're not talking, they're just gardening. okay, well, you're not romantic enough to see gardening as a way of communication between humans and plants. oh, okay, you got me there. but there is ways, there's always going to be the people who are curious, jane goodall, who lives with the chimps, right? there's always going to be curious intelligent species that visit the weird earth planet and try to interact. i mean, it's, yeah, i think it's a super cool idea that you're expressing, and just to kind of have a sense, maybe it's a hope that there's always going to be a desire to interact even with those that can't possibly understand the depth of what you understand. so i'm with you, so i want to be as positive as you that aliens do exist and we will interact with them. what i'm trying to do is to give you a reasonable hypothesis why we haven't yet, and also something to strive for, to be able to do that. i mean, there is the other view that the universe is just too big and life is just too rare, but i want to come up with an alternative explanation, which i think is reasonable and not being philosophically and scientifically thought out, which is this, if you can't actually communicate with the object, the thing, competently, you don't even know it's there, then there's no point yet. see, i disagree with that, but i'm totally aligned with your hopeful vision, which is , we need to understand the origin of life. it will help us engineer life, it will help us engineer intelligent life through perhaps on the computer side, through simulation, and explore all the ways that life emerges. and that will allow us to, i think the fundamental reason we don't see overwhelming amounts of life is i actually believe aliens, of course, these are all just kind of open-minded beliefs. it's difficult to know for sure about any of this, but i think there's a lot of alien civilizations which are actively communicating with us, and we're too dumb. we don't have the right tools to see it. that's what i'm saying. no, but maybe i misinterpreted you, but i interpreted you to say they kind of tried a few times and they're , god. no, no, no, what i'm saying is we don't, so this goes two ways. yeah, i agree with you. there could be information out there, but just put in such a way that we just don't understand it yet. right. so sorry if i didn't make that clear. i mean, it's not just, i don't think we, i think we qualify as soon as we can decode their signal. right, so when you say qualify, gotta, gotta. so you mean we're just not smart enough. the word qualify was throwing me off. so we're not smart enough to do, it's , but we just need to get smarter. and there's a lot of people who believe, let me get your opinion on this, about ufo sightings. so sightings of weird phenomena, phenomena that, you know, what does ufo mean? it means it's a flying object and it's not identified clearly at the time of sighting. that's what ufo means. so it could be a physics phenomena, could be ball lightning, it could be all kinds of fascinating. i was always fascinated with ball lightning as a, the fact that there could be physical phenomena in this world that are observable by the human eye. of course, all physical phenomena generally are fascinating that are, that really smart people can't explain. i love that. cause it's , wait a minute, especially if you can replicate it, it's , wait a minute, how does this happen? that's the precursor to giant discoveries in chemistry and biology and physics and so on. but it sucks when those events are super rare, right? physical, leg ball lightning. so that's out there. and then of course that phenomena could have other interpretations that don't have to do with the physics, the chemistry, the biology of earth. it could have to do with more extraterrestrial explanations that in large part, thanks to hollywood and movies and all those kinds of things, captivates the imaginations of millions of people. but just because it's science fiction that captivates the imagination of people, doesn't mean that some of those sightings, all it takes is one. one of those sightings is actually a sign that it's extraterrestrial intelligence, that it's an object that's not of this particular world. do you think there's a chance that that's the case? what do you make, especially the pilot sightings, what do you make of those? so i agree there's a chance, there's always a chance. any good scientist would have to, or observationist would have to, you know, i want to see if aliens exist, come to earth. what i know about the universe is i think it's unlikely right now that there are aliens visiting us, but not impossible. i think the releases, the dramatization that's been happening politically saying we're gonna release all this information, this, you know, classified information. i was kind of disappointed because it was just very poor material. and right now, you know, the ability to capture high resolution video, everybody is carrying around with them an incredible video device now. and we haven't got more compelling data. and so that we've just seeing grainy pictures, a lot of hearsay, instrument kind of malfunctions and whatnot. and so i think on balance, i think it's extremely unlikely, but i think something really interesting is happening. and also during the pandemic, right? we've all been locked down. we all want to have, we want to, our imaginations are, you know, running riot. and i think that the, i don't think that the information out there has convinced me there are anything interesting on the ufo side, but what it has made me very interested about is how humanity is opening up its mind to ponder aliens and the mystery of our universe. and so i don't want to dissuade people from having those thoughts and say you're stupid and look at that, it's clearly incorrect. that's not right, that's not fair. what i would say is that i lack sufficient data, replicated observations to make me go, , i'm gonna take this seriously, but i'm really interested by the fact that there is this great deal of interest. and i think that it drives me to maybe want to make an artificial life form even more and to help nasa and the air force and whoever go and look for things even more, because i think humanity wants to know what's out there. there's this yearning, isn't there? yeah, but i see, i almost, depending on the day, i sometimes agree with you, but with the thing you just said, but one of the disappointing things to me about the sightings, i still hold the belief that a non-zero number of them is an indication of something very interesting. so i don't side with the people who say everything can be explained with sensor artifacts kind of thing. yeah, i agree with you, i didn't say that either. i would say i just don't have enough data. but the thing i wanna push back on is the statement that everybody has a high definition camera. one of the disappointing things to me about the report that the government released, but in general, just having worked with government, having worked with people all over, is how incompetent we are. like if you look at the response to the pandemic, how incompetent we are in the face of great challenges without great leadership. how incompetent we are in the face of the great mysteries before us without great leadership. and i just think it's actually, the fact that there's a lot of high definition cameras is not enough to capture the full richness of weird, of the mysterious phenomena out there of which extraterrestrial intelligence visiting earth could be one. i don't think we have, i don't think everybody having a smartphone in their pocket is enough. i think that allows for tiktok videos. i don't think it allows for the capture of even interesting, relatively rare human events. that's not that common. it's rare to have be in the right moment in the right time to be able to capture the thing. i agree, i agree. let me rephrase what i think on this. i haven't seen enough information. i haven't really actively sorted out. i must admit, but i'm with you in that i love the idea of anomaly detection in chemistry in particular. i want to make anomalies, sorry, or not necessarily make anomalies. i want to understand an anomaly. let me give you two from chemistry, which are really quite interesting. phlogiston, going way back, where people said, there's this thing called phlogiston. and for ages, the alchemists got really this kind of, that fire is a thing. that's one, and then we determined that phlogiston wasn't what we thought it is. let's go to physics, the ether. ether's a hard one, because i think actually the ether might exist, and i'll tell you what i think the ether is later. can you explain ether? as the vacuums, as the light traveling through the ether in the vacuum, there is some thing that we call the ether that basically mediates the movement of light. and then the other one is cold fusion, which is more of, so a few years ago, that people observed it when they did some electrochemistry, when they were splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen, that you got more energy out than you put in. and people got excited, and they thought that this was a nuclear reaction. and in the end, it was kind of discredited, because you didn't detect neutrons and all that stuff. i'm pretty sure, i'm a chemist, i'm going, telling you this on your podcast, but why not? i'm pretty sure there's interesting electrochemical phenomena that's not completely bottomed out yet. that there is something there. however, we lack the technology and the experimental design. so all i'm saying in your response about aliens is we lack the experimental design to really capture these anomalies. and we are encircling the planet with many more detection systems. we've got satellites everywhere. so there is, i do hope that we are going to discover more anomalies. and remember, the solar system isn't just static in space, it's moving through the universe. so there's just more and more chance. i'm not what with avi loeb, he's generating all sorts of kind of a cult, i would say, with this. but i'm not against him. i think there is a finite chance if there are aliens in the universe that we're going to happen upon them. because we're moving through the universe. what's the nature of the following that avi loeb has? he's doubling down more and more and more and say there are aliens, interdimensional aliens and everything else, right? he's gone from space junk accelerating out of two-dimensional stuff in a very short space of time. he's obviously bored. or he wants to tap into the psyche and understand. and he's playfully kind of trying to interact with society and his peers to say, stop saying it's not possible. which i agree with, we shouldn't do that. but we should frame it statistically in the same way we should frame everything as good scientists statistically. yeah. good scientists. recently, the idea of good scientists is, i take quite skeptically. i've been listening to a lot of scientists tell me about what is good science. that makes me sad. because you've been interviewed, what i would consider a lot of really good scientists. no, that's true. a lot of really thinkers. but that's exactly right. and most of the people i talk to are incredible human beings. but there's a humility that's required. science cannot be dogmatism. sure, i agree. i mean. authority, a phd does not give you authority. a lifelong pursuit of a particular task does not give you authority. you're just as lost and clueless as everybody else. but you're more curious and more stubborn. so that's a nice quality to have. but overall, just using the word science and statistics can often, as you know, kind of become a catalyst for dismissing new ideas, out of the box ideas, wild ideas, all that kind of stuff. well, yes and no. i think that, so i to, some people find me extremely annoying in science because i'm basically, i'm quite rude and disruptive. not in a rude, you know, some people say they're ugly or stupid or anything that. i just say, you're wrong. or why do you think this? and something, a gift i got given by society when i was very young, because i was in the learning difficulties class at school is i was told i was stupid. and so i know i'm stupid, but i always wanted to be smart, right? i always, i remember going to school going, maybe today they're gonna tell me i'm not as stupid as i was yesterday. and it was always disappointed, always. and so when i went into academia and everyone said, you're wrong, i was , join the queue. yeah. because it allowed me to walk through the wall. so i think that people to always imagine science as a bit living in a japanese house, the paper walls, and everyone sits in their room. and i annoy people because i walk straight through the wall. because why should i be a chemist and not a mathematician? why should i be a mathematician and not computer scientist? because if the problem requires us to walk through those walls, but i walking through the walls. but as long, then i have to put up, i have to do good science. i have to win the people in those rooms across by good science, by taking their criticisms and addressing them head on. and i think we must do that. and i think that i try and do that in my own way. and i kind of love walking through the walls. and it gives me, it's difficult for me personally, it's quite painful, but it always leads to a deeper understanding of the people i'm with. in particular, the arguments i have with all sorts of interesting minds, because i want to solve the problem or i want to understand more about why i exist. that's it really. and i think we have to not dismiss science on that basis. i think we can work with science. no, science is beautiful, but humans with egos and all those kinds of things can sometimes misuse good things social justice, all ideas we all aspire to misuse these beautiful ideas to manipulate people to all those kinds of things. sure. there's assholes in every space and walk of life, including science. yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. and those are no good. but yes, you're right. the scientific method has proven to be quite useful. that said, for difficult questions, for difficult explanations for rare phenomena, you have to walk cautiously. because the scientific method, when you totally don't understand something and it's rare and you can't replicate it, doesn't quite apply. yeah, yeah, yeah. i agree with you. the challenge is to not dismiss the anomaly because you can't replicate it. i mean, we can talk about this. this is something i realized when we were developing assembly theory. people think the track they're on is so dogmatic, but there is this thing that they see, but they don't see. and it takes a bit of time and you just have to keep reframing it. and my approach is to say, well, why can't this be right? why must we accept that rna is the only way into life? i mean, who said? does rna have a special class of information that's encoded in the universe? no, of course it doesn't, right? rna is not a special molecule in the space of all the other molecules. but it's so elegant and simple and it works so well for the evolutionary process that we kind of use that as an intuition to explain that that must be the only way to have life. sure. but you mentioned assembly theory. well, first let me pause, bathroom break. needed? yeah, let's take two minutes. we took a quick break and offline, you mentioned to me that you have a lab in your home and then i said that you're basically rick from rick and morty, which is something i've been thinking this whole conversation. and then you say that there's a glowing pickle that you used something involving cold plasma, i believe. i don't know, but can you explain the glowing pickle situation? and is there many, arbitrarily many versions of you in alternate dimensions that you're aware of? i tried to make an electrochemical memory at home using a, and the only way, using a pickle, the only way i could get any traction with it was actually by plugging it into a very high voltage alternating current and then putting in a couple of electrodes. but my kids weren't impressed. they're not impressed with anything i do, any experiments i do at home. i think it's quite funny. but you connected a pickle to some electrode. i mean, you- to 240 volts, yeah, ac. yeah. and then had a couple of electrodes on it. so what happens is a pickle, this is a classic thing you do. i mean, i shouldn't, pranks you do. you put a plug pickle into the mains and just run away and leave it. and what happens is it starts to decompose. it heats up and then explodes because the water turns to steam and it just violently explodes. but i wondered if i could cause the iron sodium potassium ions in the pickle to migrate. it'd been in a jar, right? so it'd been in a brine. yeah, that was not my best experiment. so i've been doing far better experiments in my lab at home. at that time it was a failed experiment, but you never know. i could, every experiment is a successful experiment if you stick with it long enough. well, i mean, i get, i got kicked out of my own lab by my research team many years ago. and for good reason. i mean, my team is brilliant and i used to go and just break things. so what i do do at home is i have a kind of electronics workshop and i prototype experiments there. then i try and suggest to my team sometimes, maybe we can try this thing. and they would just say, , wow, that's not gonna work because of this. and i'll say, aha, but actually i've tried and here's some code and here's some hardware. can we have a go? so that i'm doing that less and less now as i get even more busy, but that's quite fun. cause then they feel that we're in the, you know, in the experiment together. you do in fact brilliantly, just rick from rick and morty, connect chemistry with computation. so sort of, and when we say chemistry, we don't mean the simulation of chemistry, a modeling of chemistry. we mean chemistry in the physical space as well as in the digital space, which is fascinating. we'll talk about that. but first you mentioned assembly theory. so we'll stick on theory in these big ideas. i would say revolutionary ideas. this intersection between mathematics and philosophy. what is assembly theory? and generally speaking, how would we recognize life if we saw it? so assembly theory is a theory, goes back a few years now and my struggle for maybe almost 10 years when i was going to origin of life conferences and artificial life conferences, where i thought that everybody was dancing around the problem of what life is and what it does. but i'll tell you about what assembly theory is because i think it's easier. so assembly theory literally says, if you take an object, any given object, and you are able to break the object into parts very gently. so just maybe let's say take a piece of very intricate chinese porcelain and you tap it just with a hammer, with a nail at some point, and it will fragment into many parts. and if that object is able to fragment into many, and you count those parts, the different parts, so they're unsymmetrical. assembly theory says, the larger the number of parts, unsymmetrical parts that object has, the more likely it is that object has been created by an evolutionary or information process, especially if that object is not one-off, you've got an abundance of them. and that's really important. and i, so, because if you, what i'm literally saying about the abundance, if you have a one-off object and you break it into parts, and it has lots of parts, you'd say, well, that could be incredibly intricate and complex, but it could be just random. and i was troubled with this for years because i saw in reality that assembly theory works. but when i talked to very good computational, complexity computation lists, algorithmic complexity people, they said, you haven't really done this properly, you haven't thought about it. it's , this is the random problem. and so i kept working this up because i invented an assembly theory in chemistry, first of all, with molecules. and so the thought experiment was, how complex does a molecule need to be when i find it, that it couldn't possibly have risen by chance probabilistically. and if i found this molecule, able to detect enough quantities in the same object, a machine, a mass spectrometer. so typically in a mass spectrometer, you weigh the molecules in electric field, you probably have to have all the order of 10,000 identical molecules to get a signal. so 10,000 identical molecules that are complex. what's the chance of them occurring by chance? well, we can do the math. let's take a molecule strychnine or, yeah, so strychnine is a good molecule actually to take. or viagra is a good molecule. i made jokes about viagra because it's complex molecule. and one of my friends said, yeah, if we find viagra on mars in detectable quantities, we know something is up. but anyway, it's a complex molecule. so what you do is you take this molecule in the mass spectrometer and you hit it with some electrons or in electric field and it breaks apart. and if the larger than the larger number of different parts, you know, when it starts to get to a threshold, my idea was that that molecule could not be created by chance probabilistically. so that was where assembly theory was born in an experiment, in a mass spec experiment. and i was thinking about this because nasa sending mass spectrometers to mars, to titan, it's gonna send them to europa. there's gonna be a nuclear powered mass spectrometer going to titan. i mean, this is the coolest experiment ever. they're not only sending a drone that's gonna fly around titan, it's gonna be powered by a nuclear slug, a nuclear battery, and it's gonna have a mass spectrometer on it. is this already launched? no, it's dragonfly and it's gonna be launched in a few years. i think it got pushed a year because of the pandemic. so i think three or four years. dragonfly, nuclear dragonfly is going to fly to titan and collect data about the composition of the various chemicals on titan. yeah, i'm trying to convince nasa. i don't know if i'll be able to convince the dragonfly team that they should apply this approach, but they will get data and depending on how good their mass spectrometer is. but i had this thought experiment anyway, and i did this thought experiment. and for me, it seemed to work. i turned the thought experiment into an algorithm in assembly theory. and i basically, assembly theory, if i take, let's just make it generic and let's just take the word abracadabra. so can i, if you find the word, so if you have a book with lots of words in it and you find abracadabra one-off and there's a rat book that's been written by, in a random way, you know, set of monkeys in a room and you know, and you untie priors and you find one-off abracadabra, no big deal. but if you find lots of recurrences of abracadabra, well, that means something weird is going on. but let's think about the assembly number of abracadabra. so abracadabra has a, you know, has a number of letters in it. you can break it down. so you just cut the letters up. but when you actually reassemble abracadabra, the minimum number of ways of organizing those letters, so you'd have an a, a b, you know, and keep going up. there's just, you can, when you cut abracadabra up into parts, you can put it together again in seven steps. so what does that mean? that means if you basically don't re, you're allowed to reuse things you make in a chain at the beginning, that's the memory of the universe, the process that makes abracadabra. and because of that causal chain, you can then get to abracadabra quicker than the number of letters if we're having to specify only in seven. so if you take that to a molecule and you cut the molecule up into parts and you can, on the causal chain, then you basically start with the atoms and then bonds, and then you randomly add on those parts to make the a, make the b, make the, and keep going all the way up, i found that literally assembly theory allows me to say how compressed a molecule is. so when there's some information in there. and i realized assembly theory is, it wasn't, isn't just confined to molecular space, it can apply to anything. but let me finish the molecular argument. so what i did is i had this theory, i, with one of my students, we wrote an algorithm. we basically took the 20 million molecules from the database and we just calculate their assembly number. and that's the index. like basically, if i take a molecule and i cut it up into bonds, what is the minimum number of steps i need to take to reform that molecule from atoms? so reusability of previously formed things is somehow fundamental to part of the process. exactly, so it's a memory in the universe, right? i'm making lots of leaps here. like, it's kind of weird. i'm saying, right, there's a process that can form the a and the b and the c, let's say. and then there's, and because we've formed a and b before, we can use a and b again with no extra cost, except one unit. so that's the kind of what the chain of events. and that's how you think about memory here when you say the universe, when you talk about the universe and, or life is the universe creating memory. exactly, so we went through chemical space and we looked at the assembly numbers and we were able to classify it. so, okay, let's test it, let's go. so we're able to take a whole bunch of molecules and assign an assembly index to them, okay? and it's just a function of the number of bonds in the molecule and how much symmetry. so literally, assembly theory is a measure of how little symmetry a molecule has. and so the more asymmetry, the more information, the more weird it is, a jackson pollock or some description. so i then went and did a load of experiments. and i basically took those molecules, i cut them up in the mass spec and measured the number of peaks without any knowledge of the molecule. and we found the assembly number, there was almost a, not quite a one-to-one correlation, but almost because not all bonds are equal, they have different energies. i then did this using two other spectroscopic techniques, nmr, nuclear magnetic resonance, which uses radio frequency to basically jangle the molecules and get a signature out. and i also used infrared. and infrared and nmr almost gave us a one-to-one correlation. so what am i saying? saying by taking a molecule and doing either infrared or nmr or mass spec, i can work out how many parts there are in that molecule and then put it on a scale. and what we did in the next part of the work is we took molecules randomly from the environment, from outer space, from all around earth, from the sea, from antarctica, and from fossils and so on. and even nasa, and they, because they didn't believe us, blinded some samples. and we found that all these samples that came from biology produced molecules that had a very high assembly number above a threshold of about 15. so basically all the stuff that came from an ebiotic origin was low. there was no complexity there. so we suddenly realized that on earth, at least, there is a cutoff that natural phenomena cannot produce molecules that need more than 15 steps to make them. so i realized that this is a way to make a scale of life, a scale of technology as well. and literally you could just go sniffing for molecules off earth, on titan, on mars. and when you find a molecule in the mass spectrometer that gives you more than 15 parts, you'll know pretty much for sure that it had to be produced by evolution. and this allowed me to come up with a general definition of life based on assembly theory, to say that if i find an object that has a large number of parts, say an iphone, or boeing 747, or any complex object, and i can find it in abundance and cut it up, i can tell you whether that has been produced by an informational process or not. and that's what assembly theory kind of does. but it goes a bit further. i then realized that this isn't just about life, it's about causation. so actually it tells you about whether there's a causal structure. so now i can look at objects in the universe, say that again, this cup, and say, right, i'm gonna look at how many independent parts it has. so that's the assembly number. i'll then look at the abundance. how many cups? there are two on this table, maybe there's a few more, you got snatched away. so assembly is a function of the complexity of the object times the number of copy numbers of that object, or function of the copy number normalized. so i realized there's a new quantity in the universe. you have energy, entropy, and assembly. so assembly, the way we should think about that is how much reusability there is. because what reusability is , can you play devil's advocate to this? so could this just be a nice tertiary signal for living organisms? like some kind of distant signal that's, yeah, this is a nice property, but it's not capturing something fundamental. or do you think reusability is something fundamental to life in complex organisms? i think reusability is fundamental in the universe, not just for life in complex organisms, it's about causation. so i think assembly tells you, if you find objects, because you can do this with trajectories as well, you think about it, that the fact there are objects in the universe, on earth, is weird. you think about it, we should just have a combinatorial explosion of stuff. the fact that not everything exists is really weird. now then. and then as i'm looking at two mugs and two water bottles, and the things that exist are similar and multiply in copies of each other. so i would say that assembly allows you to do something that statistical mechanics and people looking at entropy have got stuck with for a while. so i'm making, it's pretty bold. i mean, i'm writing a paper with sarah walker on this at the moment. and we're realizing, we don't wanna get ahead of ourselves because i think that there's lots of ways where this is, you know, it's a really interesting idea. it works for molecules and it appears to work for any objects produced by causation. cause you can take a motor car, you can look at the assembly of the motor car, look at a book, look at the assembly of the book. assembly theory tells you there's a way of compressing and reusing. and so when people, i talk to information theorists, they say, , this is just logical depth. i say it is logical depth, but it's experimentally measurable. they say, , it's a bit komagolov, complexity. and i say, but it's computable. and now, okay, it's not infinitely computable, gets np hard very quickly, right? it's very hard problem when you could get, but it's a computable enough, you could tractable enough to be able to tell the difference between a molecule that's been formed by the random background and by causation. and i think that that's really interesting because until now, there's no way of measuring complexity objectively. complexity has required algorithmic comparisons and programs and human beings to label things. assembly is label free. well, not entirely. we can talk about what that means in a minute. okay, my brain has been broken a couple times here. i'm sorry, i explained it really badly. no, it was very well explained. it was just fascinating. and it's, my brain is broken into pieces and i'm trying to assemble it. so np hard, so when you have a molecule, you're trying to figure out, okay, if we were to reuse parts of this molecule, which parts can we reuse as an optimization problem, np hard, to figure out the minimum amount of reused components that will create this molecule. and it becomes difficult when you start to look at a huge, huge molecules, arbitrarily large. because i'm also mapping this. can i think about this in complexity generally, looking at a cellular automata system and saying , can this be used as a measure of complexity for arbitrarily complicated system? yeah, i think it can. it can. and i think that the question is, and what's the benefit? because there's plenty of, i mean, in computer science and mathematics and physics, people have been really seriously studying complexity for a long time. and i think there's a really interesting problems of where we course grade and we lose information. and all assembly theory does really, assembly theory just explains weak emergence. and so what assembly theory says, look, going from the atoms that interact, those first replicators that build one another, assembly at the minimal level just tells you evidence that there's been replication and selection. and i think the more selected something is, the higher the assembly. and so we were able to start to know how to look for selection in the universe. if you go to the moon, there's nothing a very high assembly on the moon except the human artifacts we've left there. so again, let's go back to the sandbox. in assembly theory says, if all the sand grains could stick together, that's the infinite combinatorial explosion in the universe. that should be the default. we don't have that. now let's assemble sand grains together and do them in every possible way. so we have a series of minimal operations that can move the sand together. but all that doesn't exist either. now, because we have specific memory where we say, what, we're gonna put three sand grains in line or four make a cross or a triangle or something unsymmetrical. and once we've made the triangle and the unsymmetrical thing, we remember that we can use it again because on that causal chain. so what assembly theory allows you to do is go to the actual object that you exist, you find in space. and actually the way you get there is by disassembling. it's disassembly theory works by disassembling objects you have and understanding the steps to create them. and it works for molecules beautifully because you just break bonds. but you said, it's gonna be hard, very difficult. it's a difficult problem to figure out how to break them apart. for molecules it's easy. if you just keep low enough in molecular weight space, it's good enough. so it's a complete theory. when we start to think about objects, we can start to assign, we can start to think about things at different levels, different atoms, what you assign as your atom. so in a molecule, the atom, this is really confusing because the word atom, i mean smallest breakable part. so in a molecule, the atom is the bond because you break bonds, not atoms, right? so in a car, the atom might be, i don't know, a small amount of iron or the smallest reusable part, a rivet, a piece of plastic or something. so you gotta be really careful in a microprocessor, the atoms might be transistors. and so the amount of assembly that something has is a function, you have to look at the atom level. what are your parts? what are you counting? that's one of the things you get to choose. what is, at what scale is the atom? what is the minimal thing? i mean, there's a huge amount of trade-offs in when you approach a system and try to analyze. like if you approach earth, you're an alien civilization, try to study earth. what is the atom for trying to measure the complexity of life? is it, are humans the atoms? i would say to start with, you just use molecules. i can say for sure, if there are molecules of sufficient complexity on earth, then i know that life has made them. and then go further and show technology. there are molecules that exist on earth that are not possible even by biology. you needed technology and you needed microprocessors to get there. so that's really cool. and there's a correlation between that, between the coolness of that and assembly number, whatever the measure. what would you call the measure? assembly index. assembly index. yeah, so there are three kind of fundamental kind of labels we have. so there's the quantity of assembly and the assembly, so if you have a box, let's just have a box of molecules. so i'm gonna have my box. we count the number of identical molecules and then we chop each molecule up in an individual molecule class and calculate the assembly number. so basically you then have a function that sums over all the molecules for each assembly and then you divide through. so you make it, divide through by the number of molecules. so that's the assembly index for the box? so that will tell you the amount of assembly in the box. so basically the assembly equation we come up with is basically the sum of e to the power of the assembly index for molecule i times the number of copies of the molecule i and then you normalize. so you sum them all up and then normalize. so some boxes are gonna be more assembled than others. yeah, that's what they tell me. so if you were to look at me as a box, so say i'm a box, am i assembling my parts? in terms of , how do you know, what's my assembly index? so i'd be gentle. so let's just, we'll talk about the molecules in you. so let's just take a pile of sand the same way as you and i would take you and just cut up all the molecules. i mean, and look at the number of copies and assembly number. so in sand, let's say there's probably gonna be nothing more than assembly number of two or three, but there might be trillions and trillions of sand grains. in your body, there might be, the assembly number is gonna be higher, but there might not be quite as many copies because the molecular weight is higher. so you do wanna average it out? you can average, you do average it. i'm not defined by the most impressive molecules. no, no, you're an average in your volume. well, i mean, we're just working this out, but what's really cool is that you're gonna have a really high assembly. the sand will have a very low assembly. your causal power is much higher. you get to make decisions, you're alive, you're aspiring. assembly says something about causal power in the universe. and that's not supposed to exist because physicists don't accept that causation exists at the bottom. so i understand at the chemical level why the assembly is causation. why is it causation? because it's capturing the memory. exactly. capturing memory, but there's not an action to it. so i'm trying to see how it leads to life. well, it's what life does. so i think it's, we don't know. so- yeah, that's a good question. what is life versus what does life do? yeah, so that's, this is the definition of life. the only definition we need. the assembly. is basically that life is able to create objects in abundance that are so complex. the assembly number is so high, they can't possibly form in an environment where there's just random interactions. so suddenly you can put life on a scale and then life doesn't exist actually in that sense. it's just how evolved you are. and you as an object, because you have incredible causal power, you could go and launch rockets or build cars or create drugs or, you can do so many things. you can build stuff, build more artifacts that show that you have had causal power. and that causal power was this kind of a lineage. and i think that over time, i've been realizing that physics as a discipline has a number of problems associated with it. with me as a chemist is kind of interesting that assembly theory, and i'm really, i wanna maintain some credibility in the physicist's eyes, but i have to push them because physics is a really good discipline. it's reduced the number. physics is about reducing the belief system, but they're down to some things in their belief system, which is kind of really makes me kind of grumpy, number one is requiring order at the beginning of the universe magically. we don't need that. the second is the second law. well, we don't actually need that. this is blasphemous. in a minute, i'll recover my career in a second. although i think the only good thing about being the regis chair means i think there has to be an act of parliament to fire me. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah. you can always go to lee's twitter and protest. and i think the third thing is that, so we've got the order at the beginning. second law. the second law and the fact that causation is emergent. right? and that time is emergent. john carroll just turned off this program. i think he believes that it's emergent. so causation is not emergent. that's clearly incorrect because we wouldn't exist otherwise. so physicists have kind of got confused about time. time is a real thing. well, i mean, so look, i'm very happy with the current description of the universe as physics give me because i can do a lot of stuff, right? i can go to the moon with newtonian physics, i think, and i can understand the orbit of mercury with relativity. and so, and i can build transistors with quantum mechanics, right? and i can do all this stuff. yeah. so i'm not saying the physics is wrong. i'm just saying, if we say that time is fundamental, i.e. time is non-negotiable, there's a global clock, i don't need to require that there's order being magically made in the past because that asymmetry is built into the way the universe is. so if time is fundamental, i mean, you've been referring to this kind of, an interesting formulation of that is memory. yeah. so time is hard to put a finger on, what the hell are we talking about? well. it's just a direction, memory is a construction, especially when you have , think about these local pockets of complexity, these non-zero assembly index entities that's being constructed and they remember. never forget molecules. but remember, the thing is i invented assembly theory. i'll tell you i invented it. when i was a kid, i mean, the thing is, i keep making fun of myself from a search group. i've only ever had one idea, i keep exploring that idea over the 40 years or so since i had that idea. well, aren't you the idea that the universe had? so it's very kind of hierarchical. anyway, go ahead, i'm sorry. that's very poetic. so i think i came up with assembly theory with the following idea when i was a kid. i was obsessed about survival kits. what is the minimum stuff i would need to basically replicate my reality? and i love computers and i love technology or what technology was going to become. so i imagined that i would have basically this really big truck full of stuff. and i thought, well, can i delete some of that stuff out? can i have a blueprint? and then, and in the end, i kept making this, making it smaller and got to maybe half a truck and then to a suitcase. and then went, okay, well, screw it. i wanna carry my entire technology in my pocket. how do i do it? and i'm not gonna launch into a steve jobby and you know, i'm an iplayer. i came up with a matchbox survival kit. in that matchbox survival kit, i would have the minimum stuff that would allow me to interact the environment, to build my shelter, to build a fishing rod, to build a water purification system. and it's kind of , so what did i use in my box to assemble in the environment, to assemble, to assemble, to assemble? and i realized i could make a causal chain in my survival kit. so i guess that's probably why i've been obsessed with assembly theory for so long. and i was just pre-configured to find it somewhere. and when i saw it in molecules, i realized that the causal structure that we say emerges and the physics kind of gets really stuck because they're saying that time, you can go backwards in time. i mean, how do we let physicists get away with the notion that we can go back in time and meet ourselves? i mean, that's clearly a very hard thing to let, physicists would not let other sciences get away with that kind of heresy, right? so why are physicists allowed to get away with it? let's- so first of all, to push back to play devil's advocate, you are clearly married to the idea of memory. you see in this, again, rick from rick and morty way, you see, you have these deep dreams of the universe that is writing the story through its memories, through its chemical compounds that are just building on top of each other. and then they find useful components they can reuse. and then their reused components create systems that themselves are then reused and all in this way construct things. but when you think of that as memory, it seems quite sad that you can walk that back. but at the same time, it feels that memory, you can walk in both directions on that memory in terms of time. you could walk in both directions, but i don't think that that makes any sense because the problem that i have with time being reversible is that, i mean, i'm just a, you know, i'm a dumb experimental chemist, right? so i love burning stuff, burning stuff and building stuff. but when i think of reversible phenomena, i imagine in my head, i have to actually manufacture some time. i have to borrow time from the universe to do that. i can't, when anyone says, let's imagine that we can go back in time or reversibility, you can't do that. you can't step out of time. time is non-negotiable, it's happening. no, but see, you're assuming that time is fundamental, which most of us do when we go day to day, but it takes a leap of wild imagination to think that time is emergent. no, time is not emergent. yeah, i mean, this is an argument we can have, but i believe i can come up with an experiment. an experiment that proves that time cannot possibly be emergent. an experiment that shows how assembly theory kind of is the way that the universe produces selection and that selection gives rise to life. and also to say, well, hang on, we could allow ourselves to have a theory that requires us to have these statements to be possible. like we need to have order in the past, or we can have used the past hypothesis, which is order in the past, but as well, okay. and we have to have an arrow of time. we have to require that entropy increases. and then we can say, look, the universe is completely closed and there's no novelty, or that novelty is predetermined. what i'm saying is very, very important that time is fundamental, which means, if you think about it, the universe becomes more and more novel each step. it generates this more states and next step than it was before. so that means bigger search. so what i'm saying is that the universe wasn't capable of consciousness at day one. actually, because it didn't have enough states. but today, the universe is, so it's how- all right, all right, hold on a second. now we've pissed off the panpsychist too. okay. no, this is brilliant, sorry. part of me is just joking, having fun with this thing, but because you're saying a lot of brilliant stuff and i'm trying to slow it down before my brain explodes. so, because i wanna break apart some of the fascinating things you're saying. so novelty, novelty is increasing in the universe because the number of states is increasing. what do you mean by states? so i think the physicists almost got everything right. i can't fault them at all. i just think there's a little bit of dogma. i'm just trying to play devil's advocate. i'm very happy to be entirely wrong on this, right? i'm not right on many things at all. but if i can make less assumptions about the universe with this, then potentially that's a more powerful way of looking at things. if you think of time as fundamental, you can make less assumptions overall. exactly. it's fundamental, i don't need to add on a magical second law because the second law comes out of the fact the universe is actually, there's more states available. i mean, we might even be able to do weird things dark energy in the universe might actually just be time, right? yeah, but then you still have to explain why time is fundamental. because i can give you one explanation that's simpler than time and say god. just because it's simple doesn't mean it's, you still have to explain god and you still have to explain time. like why is it fundamental? so let's just say existence is default, which means time is the default. so look, how did you go from the existence to the default to time is the default? well, look, we exist, right? so let's just be very- we're yet to talk about what exists means. all right, let's go all the way back. yeah, yeah, yeah, okay. i think it's very poetic and beautiful what you're weaving into this. i don't think this conversation is even about the assembly, which is fascinating and we'll keep mentioning it as some of the index and this idea that i don't think is necessarily connected to time. oh, i think it is deeply connected. i can't explain it yet. so you don't think everything you've said about assembly theory and assembly index can still be correct even if time is emergent? so yeah, right now, assembly theory appears to work. i appear to be able to measure objects of high assembly in a mass spectrometer and look at their abundance and you know, all that's fine, right? it's a nice, if nothing else, it's a nice way of looking at how molecules can compress things. now, am i saying that a time has to be fundamental and not emergent for assembly theory to work? no. i think i'm saying that the universe, it appears that the universe has many different ways of using time. you could have three different types of time. you could just have time that's, the way i would think of it, if you want to hold onto emergent time, i think that's fine, let's do that for a second. hold onto emergent time and the universe is just doing its thing, then assembly time only exists when the universe starts to write memories through bonds. so let's just say there's rocks running around, you know, there's, when the bond happens and selection starts, suddenly there are, the universe is remembering cause in the past and those structures will have effects in the future. so suddenly a new type of time emerges at that point, which has a direction. and i think sean carroll at this point might even turn the podcast back on and go, okay, i can deal with that. that's fine. but i'm just basically trying to condense the conversation and say, hey, let's just have time fundamental and see how that screws with people's minds. why- you're triggering people by saying fundamental. why not? let's say , let's say- why am i, look, i'm walking through the wall. why should i grow up in a world where time, i don't go back in time. i don't meet myself in the past. there are no aliens coming from the future, right? you know, it's just - no, no, no, but that's not, no, no, no, no, no, hold on a second. that's saying, we're talking about biology or evolutionary psychology and you saying, okay, let's just assume that clothing is fundamental. people wearing clothes is fundamental. it's , no, no, no, no, wait a minute. you can't, , i think you're gonna get a lot of trouble if you assume time is fundamental. why? give me one reason why i'm getting into trouble with time being fundamental. because you might not understand the origins of this memory that might be deeper. like that, this memory, that could be a thing that's explaining the construction of these higher complexities better than just saying it's a search. it's chemicals doing a search for reusable structures that they can then use as bricks to build a house. okay, so i accept that. so let's go back a second because it's a kind of, it is, i wanted to drop the time bomb at this part because i think we can carry on discussing it for many, many, many, many, many days, many months. but i'm happy to accept that it might be wrong. but what i would to do is imagine a universe where time is fundamental and time is emergent and ask, let's just then talk about causation because physicists require that causation, so this is where i'm gonna go, causation emerges and it doesn't exist at the microscale. well, that clearly is wrong because if causation has to emerge at the macroscale, life cannot emerge. so how does life emerge? life requires molecules to bump into each other, produce replicators. those replicators need to produce polymers. there needs to be cause and effect at the molecular level. there needs to be a non-agordic to an agordic transition at some point. and those replicators have consequence, material consequence in the universe. physicists just say, , you know what? i'm gonna have a bunch of particles in a box. i'm gonna think about it in a newtonian way, in a quantum way, and i'll add on an arrow of time so i can label things and causation will happen magically later. well, how? explain causation. and they can't. the only way i can reconcile causation is having a fundamental time because this allows me to have a deterministic universe that creates novelty. and there's so many things to unpack here, but let's go back to the point. you said, can assembly theory work with emergent time? sure, it can, but it doesn't give me a deep satisfaction about how causation and assembly gives rise to these objects that move through time and space. and again, what am i saying to bring it back? i can say without fear, take this water bottle and look at this water bottle and look at the features on it. there's writing, you've got a load of them. i know that causal structures gave rise to this. in fact, i'm not looking at just one water bottle here. i'm looking at every water bottle ever been conceived of by humanity. this here is a special object. in fact, leibniz knew this. leibniz, it was at the same time of newton, he kind of got stuck. i think leibniz actually invented assembly theory. he gave soul. the soul that you see in objects wasn't the mystical soul, it is assembly. it is a fact there's been a history of objects related. and without the object in the past, this object wouldn't exist. there is a lineage and there is conserved structures, causal structures have given rise to those. fair enough. and you're saying it's just a simpler view if time is fundamental. and it shakes the physicist cage a bit, right? because i'm gonna say, but i think that- i just enjoy the fact that physicists are in cages. i think that, i mean, i would say that, you know, lee smolin, i don't want to speak for lee. i'm talking to lee about this. i think lee also is in agreement that time has to be fundamental. but i think he goes further. you know, even in space, i don't think you can go back to the same place in space. i've been to austin a few times now. this is my, i think third time i've been to austin. is austin in the same place? no, the solar system is moving through space. i'm not going back in the same space. locally i am. every event in the universe is unique. in space. and time. and time. doesn't mean we can't go back though. i mean, you know, let's just, you know, rest this conversation, which was beautiful, with a quote from the rolling stones that you can't always get what you want, which is you want time to be fundamental, but if you try, you'll get what you need, which is assembly theory. okay, let me ask you about, continue talking about complexity, and to clarify with this beautiful theory of yours that you're developing, and i'm sure we'll continue developing both in the lab and in theory. yeah, it can't be said enough. just the ideas you're playing with in your head are just, and we've been talking about it, are just beautiful. so if we talk about complexity a little bit more generally, maybe in an admiring romantic way, how does complexity emerge from simple rules? the why, the how. okay, the nice algorithm of assembly is there. i would say that the problem i have right now is, i mean, you're right, we can, about time as well. the problem is i have this hammer called assembly, and everything i see isn't there. so now let's just apply it to all sorts of things. we take the bernard instability, the bernard instability is you have oil, if you heat up oil, let's say on a frying pan, when you get convection, you get honeycomb patterns. take the formation of snowflakes, right? take the emergence of a tropical storm or the storm on jupiter. when people say, let's talk about complexity in general, what they're saying is, let's take this collection of objects that are correlated in some way, and try and work out how many moving parts or how this got, how this exists. so what people have been doing for a very long time is taking complexity and counting what they've lost, calculating the entropy. and the reason why i'm pushing very hard on assembly is entropy tells you how much you've lost. it doesn't tell you the microstates are gone. but if you embrace the bottom up with assembly, those states, and you then understand the causal chain that gives rise to the emergence. so what i think assembly will help us do is understand weak emergence, at the very least, and maybe allow us to crack open complexity in a new way. and i've been fascinated with complexity theory for many years. i mean, as soon as i could, i learned of the mandelbrot set, and i could just type it up in my computer and run it, and just show it and see it kind of unfold. it was just this kind of, this mathematical reality that existed in front of me, i just found incredible. but then i realized that actually we were cheating. we're putting in the boundary conditions all the time. we're putting in information. and so when people talk to me about the complexity of things, i say, but relative what? how do you measure them? so my attempt, my small attempt, naive attempt, because there's many greater minds than mine on the planet right now thinking about this properly, and you've had some of them on the podcast, right? just absolutely fantastic. but i'm wondering if we might be able to reformat the way we would explore algorithmic complexity using assembly. what's the minimum number of constraints we need in our system for this to unfold? so whether it's , you know, if you take some particles and put them in a box, at a certain box size, you get quasi-crystallinity coming out, right? but that emergence, it's not magic. it must come from the boundary conditions you put in. so all i'm saying is a lot of the complexity that we see is a direct read of the constraints we put in, but we just don't understand. so as i said earlier to the poor origin of life chemists, you know, origin of life is a scam. i would say lots of complexity calculation theories, a bit of a scam, because we put the constraints in, but we don't count them correctly. and i'm wondering if- oh, you're thinking in, sorry to interrupt, is assembly theory, assembly index, is a way to count the constraints? yes, that's it, that's all it is. so assembly theory doesn't lower any of the importance of complexity theory, but it allows us to go across domains and start to compare things, compare the complexity of a molecule, of a microprocessor, of the text you're writing, of the music you may compose. you've tweeted, quote, assembly theory explains why nietzsche understood we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom. so we've applied assembly theory to cellular automata in life and chemistry. what does nietzsche have to do with assembly theory? oh, that gets me into free will and everything. so let me say that again, assembly theory explains why nietzsche understood we had limited freedom rather than radical freedom. limited freedom, i suppose, is referring to the fact that there's constraints or what is radical freedom? what is freedom? so sartre was believed in absolute freedom and that he could do whatever he wanted in his imagination. and nietzsche understood that his freedom was somewhat more limited. and it kind of takes me back to this computer game that i played when i was 10. so i think it's called dragon's lair. okay. do you know dragon's lair? i think i know dragon's lair, yeah. dragon's lair, i knew i was being conned, right? dragon's lair, when you play the game, you're lucky that you grew up in a basically procedurally generated worlds. that was rpg a little bit. no, it's , is it turn-based play? was it? no. it was a role-playing game, but really good graphics and one of the first laser discs. and when you actually flick the stick, you took, it's it was a graphical adventure game with animation. and when i played this game, i really, you know, you could get through the game in 12 minutes if you knew what you were doing, if you're not making mistakes, just play the disc, play the disc, play the disc. so it was just that timing. and actually it was a complete fraud because all the animation has been prerecorded on the disc. it's the black mirror, the first interactive where they had all the, you know, several million kind of permutations of the movie that you could select on netflix. i've forgotten the name of it. so this was exactly that in the laser disc. you basically go left, go right, fight the ogre, slay the dragon. and when you flick the joystick at the right time, it just goes to the next animation to play. it's not really generating it. and i played that game and i knew i was being had. so, okay, i see. so to you, dragon lair is the first time you realized that free will is an illusion. yeah. and why does assembly theory give you hints about free will, whether it's an illusion or not? yeah, so no, so not tightly. if i do think i have some will and i think i am an agent and i think i can interact and i can play around with the model i have of the world and the cost functions. and i can hack my own cost functions, which means i have a little bit of free will. but as much as i want to do stuff in the universe, i don't think i could suddenly say, i mean, actually this is ridiculous because now i say i could try and do it. it's i'm suddenly give up everything and become a rapper tomorrow. maybe i could try that, but i don't have sufficient agency to make that necessarily happen. i'm on a trajectory. so when in dragon's lair, i know that i have some trajectories that i can play with, where sartre realized he thought that he had no assembly, no memory. he could just leap across and do everything. and nietzsche said, okay, i realize i don't have full freedom, but i have some freedom. and the 70 theory basically says that. it says, if you have these constraints in your past, they limit what you were able to do in the future, but you can use them to do amazing things. let's say i'm a poppy plant and i'm creating some opiates. opiates are really interesting molecules. i mean, they're obviously great for medicine, cause great problems in society. but let's imagine we fast forward a billion years, what will the opioids look in a billion years? well, we can guess because we can see how those proteins will evolve and we can see how the secondary metabolites will change. but they can't go radical. they can't suddenly become, i don't know, a molecule that you find in an oled in a display. they will have some, they will be limited by the causal chain that produced them. and that's what i'm getting at, saying, we're predict, we are unpredictably predictable or predictably unpredictable, predictably unpredictable within a constraint on the trajectory we're on. yeah, so the predictably part is the constraints of the trajectory and the unpredictable part is the part that you still haven't really clarified the origin of the little bit of freedom. yeah. so you're just arguing, you're basically saying that radical freedom is impossible. you're really operating in a world of constraints that are constrained by the memory of the trajectory of the chemistry that led to who you are. okay, but even just a tiny bit of freedom, even if everything, if everywhere you are in cages, if you can move around in that cage a little bit, you're free. i agree. and so the question is in assembly theory, if we're thinking about free will, where does the little bit of freedom come from? what is the i that can decide to be a rapper? what, why, what is that? that's a cute little trick we've convinced each other of so we can do fun tricks at parties or is there something fundamental that allows us to feel free, to be free? i think that that's the question that i wanna answer. i know you wanna answer it and i think it's so profound. let me have a go at it. i would say that i don't take the stance of sam harris because i think sam harris, when he said, the way he says it is almost, it's really interesting. i'd love to talk to him about it. sam harris almost thinks himself out of existence, right? because i don't, because, do you know what i mean? yeah, well, i mean, he has different views on consciousness versus free will. i think he saves himself with consciousness. he thinks himself out of existence with free will. yeah, yeah, exactly. so that mean there's no point, right? so i- he's a leaf floating on a river. yeah, i think that he, i don't know, i'd love to ask him whether he really believes that and then we could play some games. oh yeah. no, no, i then would say, i'll get him to play a game of cards with me and i'll work out the conditions on which he says no and then i'll get him to the conditions he says yes. and then i'll trap him in his logical inconsistency with that argument. because at some point when he loses enough money or the prospect of losing enough money, there's a way of basically mapping out a series of, so what will is about, let's not call it free will, what will is about is to have a series of decisions equally weighted in front of you. and those decisions aren't necessarily energy minimization. those decisions are a function of the model you've made in your mind, you're in your simulation and the way you've interacted in reality and also other interactions that you're having with other individuals and happenstance. and i think that there's a little bit of delay in time. so i think what you're able to do is say, well, i'm gonna do the counterfactual. i've done all of them and i'm gonna go this way. and you probably don't know why. i think free will is actually very complex interaction between your unconscious and your conscious brain. and i think the reason why we're arguing about it is so interesting in that we just, some people outsource their free will to that unconscious brain and some people try and overthink the free will in the conscious brain. i would say that sam harris has realized his conscious brain doesn't have free will but his unconscious brain does. that's my guess, right? and that he can't have access to the unconscious brain. and that's kind of annoying. so he's just, he's going to, through meditation, come to acceptance with that fact. yeah, which is maybe okay. i maybe, but i do think that i have the ability to make decisions and i my decisions. in fact, i mean, this is an argument i have with some people that some days i feel i have no free will and it's just an illusion. and this is one, and it makes me more radical, if you . as a, that i get to explore more of the state space and i'm , i'm gonna try and affect the world now. i'm really gonna ask the question that maybe i dare not ask or dare not, or do the thing i dare not do. and that allows me to kind of explore more. it's funny that if you truly accept that there's no free will, that is a kind of radical freedom. it's funny, but you're, because the little bit of the illusion in under that framework that you have that you can make choices, if choice is just an illusion of psychology, you can do whatever the hell you want. that's the- but we don't, do we? and i think- but because you don't truly accept that you think that there's, , you think there's a choice which is why you don't just do whatever the hell you want. like, you feel there's some responsibility for making the wrong choice, which is why you don't do it. but if you truly accept that the choice has already been made, then you can go, i don't know what is the most radical thing. i mean, but yeah, i wonder what am i preventing myself from doing that i would really want to do? probably humor stuff. like, i would love to, if i could save a game, do the thing, and then reload it later, do undo, it'd probably be humor, just to do something super hilarious. that's super embarrassing, and then just go, i mean, it's basically just fun. i would add more fun to the world. i mean, i sometimes do that. as i, you know, i sometimes, i try and mess up my reality in unusual ways by just doing things because i'm bored, but not bored. i'm not expressing this very well. i think that this is a really interesting problem that perhaps the hard sciences don't really understand that they're ever responsible for, because the question about how life emerged and how intelligence emerges and consciousness and free will, they're all ultimately boiling down to some of the same mechanics, i think. my feeling is that they are the same problem again and again and again. the transition from a boring world or a world in which there is no selection. so i wonder if free will has something to do with selection and models, and also the models you're generating in the brain, and also the amount of memory, your working memory, have available at any one time to generate counterfactuals. well, that's fascinating, so the decision-making process is a kind of selection, and that could be just another, yet another manifestation of the selection mechanism that's pervasive throughout the universe. okay, that's fascinating to think about. yeah, there's not some kind of fundamental, its own thing or something that, that is just yet another example of selection. yeah, and in the universe that's intrinsically open, you want to do that because you generate novelty. you mentioned something about, do cellular automata exist outside the human mind in our little offline conversation? why is that an interesting question? so cellular automata, complexity, what's the relationship between complexity in the human mind and trees falling in the forest? infrastructure, so the ca, so when john von neumann and conway and feynman were doing ca, so doing on paper. ca is cellular automata. yeah, just drawing them on paper. how awesome is that, that they were doing cellular automata on paper? yeah. and then they were doing a computer that takes forever to print out anything and program. sure. people are now with the tiktok, kids these days with the tiktok, don't understand how amazing it is to just play with cellular automata, arbitrarily changing the rules as you want, the initial conditions, and see the beautiful patterns emerge, sing with fractals, all of that. oh, you've just given me a brilliant idea. i wonder if there's a tiktok account that's just dedicated to putting out ca rules and if it isn't, we should make one. 100. and that will get- that will get millions of views. millions, yes. no, it will get dozens. just have it running. so look, i kind of, ca, i love cas. sorry. yeah, no. we just have to make one. i actually, a few years ago, i made some robots that talked to each other, chemical robots that played the game of hex invented by john nash by doing chemistry and they communicated by twitter, which experiments they were doing. and they had a lookup table of experiments and robot one said, i'm doing experiment 10. the other robot, okay, i'll do experiment one then. and they communicated- by twitter. like publicly or dms? yeah, yeah, yeah. can you maybe quickly explain what the game of hex is? yeah, so it's basically a hexagonal board and you try and basically, you color each element on the board of each hexagon and you try and get from one side to the other and the other one tries to block you. how are they connected? so what are the robots? it's a chemical- yeah, let's go back. so there were two robots. each robot was doing die chemistry. so making rgb, red, green, blue, red, green, blue, red, green, blue. and they could just choose from experiments to do red, green, blue. initially, i said to my group, we need to make two chemical robots that play chess. and my group were , that's too hard. no, go away. but anyways, we had the robot. by the way, if people listening to this should probably know that lee cronin is an amazing group of brilliant people. he's exceptionally well-published. he's written a huge number of amazing papers. whenever he calls himself stupid and is a sign of humility, and i deeply respect that and appreciate it. so people listening to this should know this is a world-class scientist who doesn't take himself seriously, which i really appreciate and love. anywho, talking about serious science, we're back to your group projecting your idea of chemical robots playing chess via dies. so you went to a simpler game of hex. okay, so what else? the team that did it were brilliant. i really take, i think they still have ptsd from doing it. cause i said, this is a workshop. what i'd often do is i have about 60 people on my team. and occasionally before lockdown, i would say, i'm a bit bored. we're gonna have a workshop on something. who wants to come? and then basically about 20 people turn up to my office and i say, we're gonna do this mad thing. and then it would just self-organize. and some of them would be , no, i'm not doing this. and then you get left with the happy dozen. and what we did is we built this robot and doing die chemistry is really easy. you can just take two molecules, react them together and change color. and what i wanted to do is have a palette of different molecules. you can react commentorially and get different colors. so you've got two robots. i went, wouldn't it be cool if the robots basically shared the same list of reactions to do? and they said, , and because of then you could do a kind of multi-core chemistry. like they weren't, so you'd have two chemical reactions going on at once and they could basically outsource the problem. but they're sharing the same tape. exactly. so robot one would say, i'm gonna do experiment one. and the other robot says, i'll do experiment 100. and then they cross it off. but i wanted to make it- that's brilliant by the way. i wanted to make it- that is genius. well, i wanted to make it groovier. and i said, look, let's have them competing to make, so they're playing a game of hex. and so when the robot does an experiment and the more blue the die, the more it gets the chance, the higher chance it gets to make the move it wants on the hex board. so if it gets a red color, it gets down weighted in the other robot. and so what the robots could do is they play each player move. and because the fitness function or the optimization function was to make the color blue, they started to invent reactions we weren't on the list. and they did this by not cleaning because we made cleaning optional. so when one robot realized if it didn't clean its pipes, it could get blue more quickly. and the other robot realized that, so it was getting dirty as well. and they- i didn't tell the consequences of super intelligence. okay. but- that was the game. communicating through twitter though. they were doing it through twitter and twitter bland them a couple of times. i said, come on, you've got a couple of robots doing chemistry, it's really cool. stop banning them. yeah. but in the end, we had to take them off twitter and they just communicated via a server. cause it was just, there were people saying, you can still find it, cronin lab 1 and cronin lab 2 on twitter. and it was make move, wait, mix a and b, wait 10 seconds, answer blue. i really find it super compelling that you would have a chemical entity that's communicating with the world. that was one of the things i wanna do with my origin of life reaction, right? is basically have a reactor that's basically just randomly enumerating through chemical space and have some kind of cycle. and then read out what the molecule's reading out using a mass spectrometer. and then convert that to text and publish it on twitter. and then wait until it says i'm alive. i reckon that twitter account would get a lot of followers. and i'm still trying to convince my group that we should just make an origin of life twitter account. where it's going, and it's , hello testing. i'm here. well, i'll share it. i it. i particularly enjoy this idea of a non-human entity communicating with the world via human design social network. it's quite a beautiful idea. how we were talking about ca's existing outside the human mind. so i really admire stephen wolfram. i think he's a genius, clearly a genius. and trapped in is actually, it's a problem with being so smart is you get trapped in your own mind, right? and i try to actually, i try to convince stephen that assembly theory wasn't nonsense. i'm , no, it's just nonsense. i was a little bit sad by that. so nonsense applied, even if it applied to the simplest construct of a one dimensional cellular automata, for example. yeah, yeah. but i mean, actually, maybe i'm doing myself a bit too down. it was just as a theory was coming through and i didn't really know how to explain it. but we are gonna use assembly theory in ca's instead of automata. but i wanted to, what i was really curious about is why people marvel. i mean, you marvel at ca's and they're complex. i said, well, hang on, that complexity is baked in because if you play the game of life in a ca, you have to run it on a computer. you have to have a, you have to do a number of operations, put in the boundary conditions. so is it surprising that you get this structure out? is it manufactured by the boundary conditions? and it is interesting because i think cellular automata running them is teaching me something about what real numbers are and aren't. and i haven't quite got there yet. i was playing on the airplane coming over. i'm just realized i have no idea what real numbers are really. and i was , well, i do actually have some notion of what real numbers are. and i think thinking about real numbers as functions rather than numbers is more appropriate. and then if you then apply that to ca's, then you're saying, well, actually, why am i seeing this complexity in this rule? is it, you know, is it, you've got this deterministic system and yet you get this incredible structure coming out. well, isn't that what you'd get with any real number as you apply it as a function? and you're trying to read it out to an arbitrary precision? and i wonder if ca's are just helping me, my misunderstanding is ca's might be helping me understand them in terms of real numbers. i don't know what you think. yeah, well, the function, but the devil's in the function. like which is the function that's generating your real number? it seems it's very important the specific algorithm of that function, because some lead to something super trivial, some lead to something that's all chaotic and some lead to things that are just walked that fine line of complexity and structure. i think we agree. so let's take it back a second. so take the logistic map or something, logistic equation, where you have this equation, which is you don't know what's gonna happen at m plus one, but once you've done m plus one, you know full time, you can't predict it. for me, ca's and logistic equation feel similar. and i think what's incredibly interesting, and i share your kind of wonder at running a ca, but also i'm saying, well, what is it about the boundary conditions and the way i'm running that calculation? so in my group, with my team, we actually made a chemical ca. we made game of life. we actually made a physical grid. i haven't been able to publish this paper. it's been trapped in purgatory for a long time. but it might be about- you wrote it up as a paper, how to do a chemical formulation of the game of life. we made a chemical computer and little cells. and i was playing game of life. with a bz reactions, each cell would pulse on and off, on and off, on and off. we have little stirrer bars and we have little gates. and we actually played conway's game of life in there. and we got structures in that game from the chemistry that you wouldn't expect from the actual ca. so that was kind of cool in that- cause they're interacting outside of the cells, some how. so what's happening is you're getting noise. so the thing is that you've got this bz reaction that gives on off, on off, on off, but there's also a wake and those wakes constructively interfere. and it's such a non-trivial way that's non-deterministic. and the non-determinism in the system gives very rich dynamics. and i was wondering if i could physically make a chemical computer with this ca that gives me something different that i can't get in a silicon representation of a ca where all the states are clean. cause you don't have the noise trailing into the next round. you just have the state. so the paper in particular, so that's just a beautiful idea to use a chemical computer to construct a cellular automaton, the famous one of game of life. but it's also interesting and it's a really interesting scientific question of whether some kind of random perturbations or some source of randomness can have a significant constructive effect on the complexity of the system. and indeed, i mean, whether it's random or just non-deterministic and can we bake in that non-determinism at the beginning? i wonder what is the, i'm trying to think about what is the encoding space? encoding space is pretty big. we have 49 star, so 49 cells, 49 chem bits, all connected to one another in an analog computer, but being read out discreetly as the bz reaction. so just to say the bz reaction is a chemical oscillator. and what happened in each cell is it goes between red and blue. so two russians discovered it, belousov-zaborskinski. i think belousov first proposed it and everyone said, you're crazy, it breaks the second law. and zaborskinski said, no, it doesn't break the second law, it's consuming a fuel. and so, and then, and it's , there's a lot of chemistry hidden in the russian literature actually, because russians just wrote it in russian, they didn't publish it in english speaking journals. it's heartbreaking actually. well, yeah, sadden, it's great that it's there, right? it's not lost. i'm sure we will find a way of translating it properly. well, the silver lining slash greater sadness of all of this is there's probably ideas in english speaking, there's ideas in certain disciplines that if discovered by other disciplines would crack open some of the biggest mysteries in those disciplines. like computer science, for example, is trying to solve problems nobody else has ever tried to solve problems. as if it's not already been all addressed in cognitive science and psychology and mathematics and physics and just whatever you want to, economics even. but if you look into that literature, you might be able to discover some beautiful ideas. obviously, russian is an interesting case of that is because there's a lawson translation, but you said there's a source of fuel, a source of energy. yeah, yeah, so the bz reaction, you have an acid in there called melonic acid. and what happens is it, when it, when it, it's basically a battery that powers it and it loses co2, so decarboxylates. it's just a chemical reaction. what that means we have to do is continuously feed or we just keep the bz reaction going in a long enough time. so it's it's reversible in time. but only . but only , but it's fascinating. i mean, the team that did it, i'm really proud of their persistence. we made a chemical computer. it can solve little problems. it can solve traveling salesman problems actually. nice. but i say, it's cop, it's true. but not any faster than a regular computer. is there something you could do? maybe, i'm not sure. i'm not, i think we can come up with a way of solving problems, also really complex, hard ones. cause it's an analog computer and we can, we can, the, it can energy minimize really quickly. it doesn't have to basically go through every element in the matrix, flip it. it just reads out. so we could actually do monte carlo by just shaking the box. it's literally a box shaker. you don't actually have to encode the shaking of the box and it's silicon memory and then just shuffle everything around. yeah. it's analog, it's natural. so it's a, it's an organic computer. yeah. so we're, so i was playing around with this and i was kind of annoying some of my colleagues. i'm wondering if we could get to chemical supremacy, quantum supremacy. and i kind of calculated how big the grid has to be so we can actually start to solve problems faster than a silicon computer. but i'm not willing to, to state how that is yet. cause i'm probably wrong. it's not that i'm, it's any top secret thing is i want, i think i can make a chemical computer that can solve optimization problems faster than the silicon computer. that's fascinating. but then you're unsure how big that has to be. yeah. i think, i mean, i'd be a big box, hard to shake. it might be exactly a big box, hard to shake and basically a bit sloppy. did we answer the question about do a cellular atomic exist outside the mind? we didn't, but i would, i would posit that they don't. and i, and, but i think minds can, well. so the mind is fundamental. what's the, why? well, i mean, sorry, let's just go to the back. so as a physical phenomena, do cas exist in physical reality, right? i would say they probably don't exist outside the human mind, but now we've constructed them, they exist in computer memories. they exist in my lab, they exist on paper. so they are, they emerge from the human mind. i'm just interested in, because stephen wolfram cas, a lot of people cas and likes to think of them as minimal computational elements. i'm just saying, well, do they exist in reality or are they a representation of a simple machine that's just very elegant to implement? so it's a platonic question, i guess. yeah. i mean, it's, there's initial conditions. there's a memory in the system. there's simple rules that dictate the evolution of the system. so what exists? the idea, the rules, the- yeah. people who are using cas as models for things in reality to say, hey, look, you can do this thing in a ca. and my, when i see this, i'm saying, , that's cool. but what does that tell me about reality? where's the ca in space? oh, i see. well, right. it's a mathematical object. so for people who don't know cellular automata, there's usually a grid, whether it's one dimensional, two dimensional, or three dimensional, and it evolves by simple local rules. like you die or are born. if the neighbors are alive or dead. and it turns out if you have, with certain kinds of initial conditions and with certain kinds of very simple rules, you can create arbitrarily complex and beautiful systems. and to me, you know, whether drugs are involved or not, i can sit back for hours and enjoy the mystery of it, how such complexity can emerges. it gives me almost , you know, people talk about religious experiences. it gives me a sense that you get to have a glimpse at the origin of this whole thing. whatever is creating this complexity from such simplicity is the very thing that brought my mind to life. this me, the human, our human civilization. and yes, those constructs are pretty trivial. i mean, that's part of their magic is even in this trivial framework, you could see the emergence, or especially in this trivial framework, you could see the emergence of complexity from simplicity. i guess what lee, you're saying is that this is not, you know, this is highly unlike systems we see in the physical world, even though they probably carry some of the same magic, mechanistically. i would say, i mean, i'm saying that the operating system that a ca has to exist on is quite complex. right. and so i wonder if you're getting the complexity at the ca from the boundary conditions, the operating system, the underlying digital computer. oh, wow, those are some strong words against ca's then. i didn't realize- not against. i mean, i'm in love with ca's as well. i'm just saying they aren't as trivial as people think. they are incredible. to get to that richness, you have to iterate billions of times, and you need a display, and you need a math co-processor, and you need a von neumann machine based on a turing machine with digital error correction and states. wow, to think that for the simplicity of a grid, you're basically saying a grid is not simple. yeah. it requires incredible complexity to bring a grid to life. yeah. yeah, that's- what then, what is simple? that's all i wanted to say. i agree with you with the wonder of ca's, i just think, but remember, we take so much for granted what the ca is resting on, because von neumann and feynman weren't showing, weren't seeing these elaborate structures. they could not get that far. yeah, but that's the limitation of their mind. yeah, yeah, exactly, limitation of their pencil. but i think that's, the question is whether the essential elements of the cellular automata is present without all the complexities required to build a computer. and my intuition, the reason i find it incredible is that, yeah, my intuition is yes. it might look different. there might not be a grid- structure, but local interactions operating under simple rules and resulting in multi-hierarchical complex structures feels a thing that doesn't require a computer. i agree, but coming back to von neumann and feynman and wolfram, their minds, the non-trivial minds, to create those architectures and do it and to put on those state transitions. and i think that's something that's really incredibly interesting that is understanding how the human mind builds those state transition machines. i could see how deeply in love with the idea of memory you are. so it's how much of e equals mc squared is more than an equation. it has albert einstein in it. like you're saying, , you can't just say this is a, the equations of physics are a really good simple capture of a physical phenomena. it is also has the, that equation has the memory of the humans. absolutely, absolutely, yeah. but i don't, i don't know if you're implying this, i don't, that's a beautiful idea, but i don't know if i'm comfortable with that sort of diminishing the power of that equation. no, no, it enhances it. because it's built on the shoulders, it enhances it. i think it enhances it. it's not, that equation is the minimal compressed representation of reality, right? we can use machine learning or max tegmark's ai feynman to find lots of solutions for gravity, but isn't it wonderful that the laws that we do find are the maximally compressed representations? yeah, but that representation, you can now give it as, i guess the universe has the memory of einstein with that representation, but then you can now give it as a gift for free. yeah, yeah, it's low memory. einstein had to go through a lot of pain to get there, but it's low memory. so i say that physics and chemistry and biology are the same discipline. they're just physics, laws in physics, there's no such thing as a law in physics, it's just low memory stuff. because you've got low memory stuff, you can, things reoccur quickly. as you build in more memory, you get to chemistry, so things become more contingent. when you get to biology, more contingent still, and then technology. so the more memory you need, the more your laws are local. that's all i'm saying, in that the less memory, the more the laws are universal, because they're not laws, they are just low memory states. we have to talk about a thing you've kind of mentioned already a bunch of times, but doing computation through chemistry, chemical-based computation. i've seen you refer to it as, in a sexy title of chemputation. so what is computation, and what is chemically, chemical-based computation? okay, so chemputation is a name i gave to the process of building a state machine to make any molecule physically in the lab. and so as a chemist, chemists make molecules by hand. and they're quite hard, the chemists have a lot of tacit knowledge, a lot of ambiguity. it's not possible to go uniformly to the literature and read a recipe to make a molecule, and then go and make it in the lab every time. some recipes are better than others, but they all assume some knowledge. and it's not universal what that is. so it's carried from human to human, some of that implicit knowledge. and you're saying, can we remove the human from the patient? can we program? what, by the way, what is a state machine? so a state machine is a, i suppose, a object either abstract or mechanical, where you can do a unit operation on it and flick it from one state to another. so a turnstile would be a good example of a state machine. there's some kinds of states and some kind of transitions between states. and it's very formal in nature in terms of how precise how you do those transitions. yes, you can mathematically precisely describe a state machine. so, i mean, a very simple boolean gates are a very good way of building kind of logic-based state machines. obviously a turing machine, the concept of a turing machine where you have a tape and a read head and a series of rules in a table. and you would basically look at what's on the tape. and if you're shifting the tape from left to right, and if you see a zero or one, you look in your lookup table and say, right, i've seen a zero and a one. i then do, i then respond to that. so in the turnstile would be, is there a human being pushing the turnstile in direction clockwise? if yes, i will open, let them go. if it's anti-clockwise, no. so yeah, so a state machine has some labels and a transition diagram. so you're looking to come up with a chemical computer to form state machines to create molecules or? yeah. which, what's the chicken and the egg? so computation is not a chemical computer because we talked a few minutes about actually doing computations with chemicals. what i'm now saying is i want to use state machines to transform chemicals. and so- so build chemicals programmatically. yeah. i mean, i get in trouble saying this. i said to my group, i shouldn't say it because it's, but i said, look, we should make the crack bot. is it in the crack robot? the robot that makes crack? the crack bot? oh, crack bot. the robot that makes crack, but maybe we should scrub this from, but- no, or, well, so maybe you can educate me on breaking bad with maths, right? yeah, so in breaking bad- so you want to make basically some kind of mix of ex machina and breaking bad. no, i don't. i don't, on the record, i don't, but i said- you don't. i said, that's what i'm going to do once you release the papers. but i shaved my head and i'm going to live a life of crime. anyway, i'm sorry. no, no. so yeah, let's get back to, so indeed, it is about making drugs, but importantly, making important drugs. all drugs matter. yeah, but let's go back. so the basic thesis is chemistry is very analog. there is no state machine. and i wandered into the, through the paper walls in the japanese house a few years ago and said, okay, hey, organic chemists, why are you doing this analog? they said, well, chemistry is really hard. you can't automate it. it's impossible. i said, but is it impossible? they said, yeah. and they said, i got the impression they're saying it's magic. and so when people tell me things are magic, it was , no, no, they can't be magic. right, so let's break this down. and so what i did is i went to my group one day about eight years ago and said, hey guys, i've written this new programming language for you. and so everything is clear. and you have to, you're not allowed to just wander around the lab willy nilly. you have to pick up things in order, go to the balance of the right time and all this stuff. and they looked at me as if i was insane and basically kicked me out of the lab and said, no, don't do that. we're not doing that. and i said, okay. so i went back the next day and said, i'm gonna find some money so we can make cool robots do chemical reactions. and everyone went, that's cool. and so in that process. the person tried to convert the humans to become robots. and next you could, you might as well just create the robots. yes, but so in that, in that, the formalization process. yeah, so what i did is said, look, chemical, to make a molecule, you need to do four things abstractly. i want to make a chemical turing machine. because a turing machine, you think about this, imagine a turing machine. turing machine is the ultimate abstraction of a computation because it's been shown by turing and others that basically a universal turing machine should be able to do all computations that you can imagine. it's , wow, why didn't i think of a turing machine for chemistry? let's think of a magic robot that can make any molecule. let's think about that for a second. okay, great. how do we then implement it? and i think it's, so what is the abstraction? so to do, to make any molecule, you have to do a reaction. so you have to put reagents together, do a reaction in a flask, typically. then you're after the reaction, you have to stop the reactions. you do what's called a workup. so whatever, cool it down, add some liquid to it, extract. so then after you do the workup, you separate. so you then remove the molecules, separate them all out. and then the final step is purification. so reaction, workup, separate, purify. so this is basically exactly a turing machine where you have your tape, you have your tape head, you have some rules, and then you run it. so i thought, cool. i went to all the chemists and said, look, chemistry isn't that hard. reaction, workup, separation, purification, do that in cycles forever for any molecule, all the chemistry, done. and they said, chemistry is that hard. i said, but just in principle. and i got a few very enlightened people to say, yeah, okay, in principle, but it ain't gonna work. and this was in about 2013, 2014. and i found myself going to an architecture conference almost by accident. it's , why am i at this random conference on architecture? and that was because i published a paper on inorganic architecture. and they said, come to architecture conference, but the inorganic architecture is not nano architecture. and i went, okay. and then i found these guys at the conference, 3d printing ping pong balls and shapes. and this is through it, 3d printing was cool. and it's , this is ridiculous. why are you 3d printing ping pong balls? and i gave them a whole load of abuse, i normally do when i first meet people, how to win friends and influence people. and then i was , my god, you guys are geniuses. and so i got from, they were a bit confused because i was calling them idiots and then call them geniuses. it's , will you come to my lab and we're gonna build a robot to do chemistry with a 3d printer? and they said, , that's cool. all right. so i had them come to the lab and we started to 3d print test tubes. so you imagine, 3d print a bottle and then use the same gantry to basically, rather than to squirt out plastic out of a nozzle, have a little syringe and jump chemicals in. so we had the 3d printer, because simultaneously print the test tube and then put chemicals into the test tube. and then- oh, so it's really end to end. yeah. and it's , that'll be cool because they've got g-code to do it all. and i was , that's cool. so i got my group doing this and i developed it a bit. and i realized that we could take those unit operations and we built a whole bunch of pumps and valves. and i realized that i could basically take the literature and i made the first version of the computer in 2016, 17. i made some architectural decisions. so i designed the pumps and valves in my group. i did all the electronics in my group. they were brilliant. i cannot pay tribute to my group enough in doing this. they were just brilliant. and there were some poor souls there that said, lee, why are you making this design electronics? i'm , well, because i don't understand it. they're , so you're making this design stuff because you don't understand. i was , yeah. but can we not just buy some? i said, well, we can, but then i don't understand how to, what bus they're gonna use and the serial ports and all this stuff. i just wanted, and i made, i came up with a decision to design a bunch of pumps and valves. i use power over ethernet. so i got one cable for power and data. plug them all in, plug them all into a router and then i made the state machine. and there was a couple of cool things i did. oh, they did actually. we got the abstraction. so reaction, workup, separation, purification. and then i made the decision to do it in batch. now it's in batch. all chemistry had been digitized before, apparently. it was, it's been done, but everyone had been doing it in flow. and flow is continuous and there are infinities everywhere. and you have to just, and i realized that i could actually make a state machine where i basically put stuff in the reactor, turn it from one state to another state, stop it and just read it out. and okay, and i was kind of pitching it, electrical engineers saying, you have it easy. you don't have to clean out the electrons. electrons don't leave a big mess. they leave some em waste. but in my state machine, i built in cleaning. so it's , we do an operation and then it cleans the backbone and then can do it again. so there's no- so what we managed to do over a couple of years is develop the hardware, develop the state machine, and we encoded three molecules. we did three, the first three, we did nitrile, a sleeping drug, rifinamide, anti-seizure and viagra. and i could make jokes on the paper. it's a hard problem, blah, blah, blah, blah. that is very good. and then in the next one, what we did, said, okay, my poor organic chemist said, look, lee, we've worked with you this long. we've made a robot that looks it's gonna take our jobs away and not just take our jobs away, what we love in the lab, but now we have to become programmers. but we're not even good programmers. we just have to spend ages writing lines of code that are boring and it's not as elegant. i went, you're right. so then, but i knew because i had this abstraction and i knew that there was language, i could suddenly develop a state machine that would interpret the language, which was lossy and ambiguous and populate my abstraction. so i built a chemical programming language that is actually gonna be recursively innumerable. it's gonna be a turing complete language actually, which is kind of cool, which means it's for me verifiable. so where we are now is we can now read the literature using a bit of natural language processing. it's not the best. there are many other groups have done better job, but we can use that language reading to populate the state machine and basically add, subtract. we got about a number of primitives that we basically program loops that we dovetail together and we can make any molecule with it. okay, so that's the kind of program synthesis. so you start at , literally you're talking about a paper, a scientific paper that's being read natural language processing, extracting some kind of details about chemical reactions and the chemical molecules, the compos involved. and then that's, in gpt terms, serves as a prompt for the program synthesis that's kind of trivial right now. there you have a bunch of different for loops and so on that creates a program in this chemical language that can then be interpreted by the chemical computer, the computer. yeah, computer, that's right. yeah. everything sounds better in your british accent, i love it. so into the computer and that's able to then basically be a 3d printer for these molecules. yeah, i wouldn't call it a 3d printer, i would call it a universal chemical reaction system because 3d printing gives the wrong impression, but yeah. and it purifies. and the nice thing is that that code now, we call it the kydl code is really interesting because now, so computation, what is computation? computation is what computing is to mathematics, i think. computation is the process of taking chemical code and some input reagents and making the same molecule, making the molecule reproducibly every time without fail. what is computation? it's the process of using a program to take some input conditions and give you an output, same every time, right? well, reliably. so the problem is, now maybe you can push back and correct me on this. so i know biology is messy. my question is how messy is chemistry? so if we use the analogy of a computer, it's easier to make computation in a computer very precise, that it's repeatable, it makes errors almost never. if it does the exact same way over and over and over and over. what about chemistry? is there messiness in the whole thing? can that be somehow leveraged? can that be controlled? can be that removed? do we wanna remove it from the system? oh, yes and no, right. is there messiness? there is messiness because chemistry is , you're doing reactions on billions of molecules and they don't always work, but you've got purification there. and so what we've found is at the beginning, everyone said it can't work. it's gonna be too messy. it'll just fail. and i said, but you managed to get chemistry to work in the lab. are you magic? are you doing something? so i would say, now go back to the first ever computer or the eniac, 5 million soldered joints, 400,000 valves that are exploding all the time. was that, would you have gone, okay, that's messy. so we've got the, and have we got the equivalent of the eniac in my lab? we've got 15 computers in the lab now and they, are they unreliable? yeah, they fall apart here and there, but are they getting better really quickly? yeah. are they now able to reliably make more? are we at the point in the lab where there are some molecules we would rather make on the computer than have a human being make? yeah, we've just done, we've just made a anti-influenza molecule and some antivirals, six steps on the computer that would take a human being about one week to make arbidol of continuous labor. and all they do now is load up the reagents, press go button and just go away and drink coffee. wow, so this, i mean, and this is, you're saying this computer is just the early days. and so some of the criticism just have to do with the early days. and yes, i would say that something this is quite impossible. so the fact that you're doing this is incredible. not impossible, of course, but extremely difficult. it did seem really difficult. and i do keep pinching myself when i go in the lab. i was , is it working? like, yep. and it's not, it does clog, it does stop. you gotta clean, this is great. but it's getting more reliable because i made some, we just made design decisions and said, we are not gonna abandon the abstraction. think about it, if the von neumann implementation was abandoned, i mean, think about what we do to semiconductors to really constrain them to what we do to silicon in a fab lab. we take computation for granted. silicon is not in its natural state. we are doping the hell out of it. it's incredible what they're able to accomplish and achieve that reliability at the scale they do. like you said, that's after moore's law, what we have now and what we, you know, how it started, you know, now we're here. so think about it now. we started at the bottom, now we're here. we have only have 20 million molecules, well, say 20 million molecules in one database, maybe a few hundred million in all the pharmaceutical companies. and those few hundred million molecules are responsible for all the drugs that we've had in humanity, except, you know, biologics for the last 50 years. now imagine what happens when a drug goes out of print, goes out of print because there's only a finite number of manufacturing facilities in the world that make these drugs. is that a print? yeah, isn't that computer? it's a printing press for chemistry. yeah, and not only that, we can protect the kydl so we can stop bad actors doing it. we can encrypt them and we can give people light. kydl, that's the name, sorry to interrupt, is the name of the programming language? yeah, the kydl is the name of the programming language and the code we give the chemicals. so ky, as in, you know, just for, it's a, it's actually an xml format, but i've now taken it from script to a fully expressible programming language so we can do dynamics and there's four loops in there and conditional statements. right, but the structure, it started out as a, an xml type of thing. yeah, yeah, yeah. now we also, the chemist doesn't need to program in kydl, they can just go to the software and type in, add a to b, reflux, do what they would normally do and you just convert it to kydl and they have a linter to check it. and they're correct. so how do you, you know, not with ascii, but because it's a greek letter, how do you go with, how do you spell it just using the english alphabet? we just, x-d-l? x-d-l, but we put in ky. and it was named by one of my students and one of my post-docs many years ago and i quite liked it. it's , it's important i think, when the team are contributing to such big ideas, cause there's their ideas as well. i try not to just rename, i didn't call it cronin or anything that, cause they keep saying, you know, is the chemistry, when they're putting stuff in the computer one of my students said, we are asking now, is it cronin complete? and i was , what does that mean? they said, well, can we make it on the damn machine? and i was , , is that a compliment or a majority? and they're , well, it might be better. yeah, so you tweeted, quote, why does chemistry need a universal programming language, question mark? for all the reasons you can think of, reliability, interoperability, collaboration, remove ambiguity, lower cost, increase safety, open up discovery, molecular customization and publication of executable chemical code. which is fascinating by the way, just publish code. and can you maybe elaborate a little bit more about this chidl, what is the universal language of chemistry look ? a cronin complete language. it's a turing complete language really. but so what it has, it has a series of operators in it, add, heat, stir. so there's a bunch of just unit operations. and all it is really is just, with chemical engineers, when i talked about this, that you've just rediscovered chemical engineering. and i said, well, yeah, i know. they said, well, that's trivial. i said, well, not really. well, yes, it is trivial. and that's why it's good because not only have we rediscovered chemical engineering, we've made it implementable on the universal hardware that doesn't cost very much money. and so the chidl has a series of statements define the reactor. so defines the reagents. so they're all labels. so you assign them. and what i also implemented at the beginning is because i give all the hardware ip address, you put it on a graph. and so what it does is the graph is equivalent to the processor firmware, the processor code. so when you take your chidl and you go to run it on your computer, you can run it on any compatible hardware in any configuration, it says, what's your graph look ? as long as i can solve the problem on the graph with these unit operations, you have the resources available, chem piles. ah ha. ha ha ha. ah. all right, we can carry on for years. i mean, it is really, it's compilation. and compilation, yeah. and what it now does is it says, okay, the problem we have before is it was possible to do robotics for chemistry, but the robots were really expensive. they were unique. they were vendor locked. and what i want to do is to make sure that every chemist in the world can get access to machinery this at virtually no cost because it makes it safer. it makes it more reliable. and then if you go to the literature and you find a molecule that could potentially cure cancer, and let's say the molecule that could potentially cure cancer takes you three years to repeat, and maybe a student finishes their phd in the time and they never get it back. so it's really hard to kind of get all the way to that molecule and it limits the ability of humanity to build on it. if they just download the code and can execute it, it turns, i would say the electronic laboratory notebook in chemistry is a data symmetry because no one will ever reproduce it. but now the data symmetry is a jupiter notebook and you can just execute it. a notebook and people can play with it. they access to it. reversion it. orders of magnitude is increased. we'll talk about the, so as with all technologies, i think there's way more exciting possibilities, but there are also terrifying possibilities and we'll talk about all of them. but let me just kind of linger on the machine learning side of this. so you're describing programming, but it's a language. i don't know if you've heard about openai codex, which is- yeah, i'm playing with it. you're playing with it? of course you are. you really are rick from rick and morty. this is great. okay. except philosophically, i mean, he is, i guess, kind of philosophically deep too. so for people who don't know gpt, gpt-3, it's a language model that can do natural language generation. so you can give it a prompt and it can complete the rest of it. but it turns out that that kind of prompt, it's not just completes the rest of it, it's generating novel sounding text. and then you can apply that to generation of other kinds of stuff. so these kinds of transformer-based language models are really good at forming deep representations of a particular space, a medium, language. so you can then apply it to a specific subset of language programming. so you can have it learn the representation of the python programming language and use it to then generate syntactically and semantically correct programs. so you can start to make progress on one of the hardest problems in computer science, which is program synthesis. how do you write programs that accomplish different tasks? so what openai codex does is it to generate those programs based on a prompt of some kind. usually you can do a natural language prompt. so basically as you do when you program, you write some comment, which serves the basic documentation of the inputs and the outputs and the function of the particular set of code and it's able to generate that. point being is you can generate programs using machine learning, using neural networks. those programs operate on the boring old computer. can you generate programs that operate, this gotta be a clever version of programs for this, but can you write programs that operate on a computer? yep, there's actually software out there right now. we can go and do it. really? yeah, yeah, it's a heuristic. it's rule-based, but we have what we've done, inspired by codex actually, is over the summer i ran a little workshop. some of my groups got this inspired idea that we should get a load of students and ask them to manually collect data to label chemical procedures into kydl. and we have a cool synth reader. so there's a bunch of people doing this right now, but they're doing it without abstraction. and because we have an abstraction that's implementable in the hardware, we've developed basically a chemical analog of codex. when you say abstraction in the hardware, what do you mean? so right now, a lot of people doing machine learning and reading chemistry and saying, , you've got all these operations, add, shake, whatever, but because they don't have a uniform, i mean, there's a couple of groups doing it, some competitors actually, and they're good, very good, but they can't run that code automatically. they are losing meaning. and the really important thing that you have to do is generate context. and so what we've learned to do with our abstraction is make sure we can pull the context out of the text. and so can we take a chemical procedure and read it and generate our executable code? yes. what's the hardest part about that whole pipeline, from the initial text, interpreting the initial text of a paper, extracting the meaningful context and the meaningful chemical information, to then generating the program, to then running that program in the hardware. what's the hardest part about that pipeline as we look towards a universal turing computer? so the hardest thing with the pipeline is that the software, the model gets confused between some meanings, right? so if chemists are very good at inventing words that aren't broken down, so the classic word that you would use for boiling something is called reflux. so reflux is, you'd have a solvent in a round-bottom flask, at reflux it would be boiling, going up the reflux condenser and coming down. but that term reflux, to reflux, could be changed, you know, to, people often make up words, new words, and then the software can fall over. but what we've been able to do is a bit in python, or any programming language, is identify when things aren't matched. so you present the code and you say, this isn't matched, you may want to think about this, and then the user goes and says, , i mean reflux, and just ticks a box and collects it. so what the codex or the chemex does in this case, is it just, it suggests the first go, and then the chemist goes and corrects it. and i really want the chemist to correct it, because it's not safe, i believe, for it to allow ai to just read literature and generate code at this stage. because now you're having actual, by the way, chemex, nice. nice name. so you are unlike, which is fascinating, is that we live in a fascinating moment in human history. but yes, you're literally connecting ai to some physical, and , it's building something in the physical realm. yeah. especially in the space of chemistry that operates sort of invisibly. yeah, yeah, i would say that's right. and it's really important to understand those labeling schemes, right? and one of the things i was never, i was always worried about at the beginning that the abstraction was gonna fall over. and the way we did it was just by brute force to start with. we just kept reading the literature and saying, is there anything new? can we add a new rule in? and actually, our chidl language expand, exploded. there was so many extra things we had to keep adding. and then i realized the primitives still were maintained and i could break them down again. so it's pretty good. i mean, there are problems. there are problems with interpreting any big sentence and turning it into an actionable code. and the codex is not without its problems. you can crash it quite easily, right? you can generate nonsense. but boy, it's interesting. i would love to learn to program now using codex, right? just hacking around, right? and i wonder if chemists in the future will learn to do chemistry by just hacking around with the system writing different things. because the key thing that we're doing with chemistry is that where a lot of mathematical chemistry went wrong is people, and i think wolfram does this in mathematica, he assumes that chemistry is a reaction where atom a or molecule a reacts with molecule b to give molecule c. that's not what chemistry is. chemistry is take some molecule, take a liquid or a solid, mix it up and heat it, and then extract it. so the programming language is actually with respect to the process operations. and if you flick in process space, not in chemical graph space, you unlock everything. because there's only a finite number of processes you need to do in chemistry. and that's reassuring. and so we're in the middle of it. it's really exciting. it's not the be all and the end all. and there is, i say, errors that can creep in. one day we might be able to do it without human interaction, you simulate it. and you'll know enough about the simulation that the lab won't catch fire. but there are so many safety issues right now that we've got to really be very careful. protecting the user, protecting the environment, protecting misuse. i mean, there's lots to discuss if you want to go down that route, because it's very, very interesting. you don't want novichok being made or explosives being made or recreational drugs being made. but how do you stop a molecular biologist making a drug that's gonna be important for them looking at their particular assay on a bad actor trying to make methamphetamine? i saw how you looked at me when you said bad actor, but that's exactly what i'm gonna do. i'm trying to get the details of this can be first. don't worry, we can protect you from yourself. okay. i'm not sure that's true, but that statement gives me hope. does this ultimately excite you about the future or does it terrify you? so let's, we mentioned that time is fundamental. it seems you're at the cutting edge of progress that will have to happen, that will happen. that there's no stopping it. and i, as we've been talking about, i see obviously a huge number of exciting possibilities. so whenever you automate these kinds of things, just the world opens up. it's programming itself and the computer, regular computer has created innumerable applications. it made the world better in so many dimensions. and it created of course a lot of negative things that we for some reason to focus on using that very technology to tweet about it. but i think it made a much better world, but it created a lot of new dangers. so maybe you can speak to when you have, when you kind of stand at the end of the road for building a really solid, reliable, universal computer. what are the possibilities that are positive? what are the possibilities that are negative? how can we minimize the chance of the negative? yeah, that's a really good question. so there's so many positive things from drug discovery, from supply chain stress, for basically enabling chemists to basically build more productive in the lab, right? where this isn't, the computer's not gonna replace the chemist. there's gonna be a moore's law of molecules, right? there's gonna be so many more molecules we can design, so many more diseases we can cure. so chemists in the lab as researchers, that's better for science. so they can build a bunch of, they could do science at a much more accelerated pace. so it's not just the development of drugs, it's actually doing the basic understanding of the science of drugs. and the personalization, the cost of drugs right now, we're all living longer. we're all having more and more, we know more about our genomic development. we know about our predetermination and we might be able to, one dream i've got is , imagine you can work at your genomic system, tells you you're gonna get cancer in seven years time, and you have your personal computer that cooks up the right molecule just for you to cure it. that's a really positive idea. the other thing is when drugs, so right now i think it is absolutely outrageous that not all of humanity has access to medicine. and i think the computer might be able to change that fundamentally, because it will disrupt the way things are manufactured. so let's stop thinking about manufacturing in different factories. let's say that computers, clinical grade computers or drug grade computers will be in facilities all around the world, and they can make things on demand as a function of the cost. maybe people won't be able to afford the latest and greatest patent, but maybe they'll be able to get the next best thing and we'll basically democratize, make available drugs to everybody that they need. and there's lots of really interesting things there. so i think that's gonna happen. i think that now let's take the negative. before we do that, let's imagine what happened, go back to a really tragic accident a few years ago, well not accident, an act of murder by that pilot on the, i think it was eurowings or swisswings, but what he did is plane took off. he waited till his pilot went to the toilet. he was a co-pilot. he locked the door and then set the autopilot above the alps, he set the altimeter or the descend height to zero. so the computer just took the plane into the alps. now, i mean, that was such a tragedy that obviously the guy was mentally ill, but it wasn't just a tragedy for him, it was for all the people on board. but what if, and i was inspired by this and my thinking, what can i do to anticipate problems this in the computer? had the software and i'm sure boeing and airbus will be thinking, , maybe i can give the computer a bit more situational awareness. so whenever one tries to drop the height of the plane and it knows it's above the alps, we'll just say, no, computer says no, we're not letting you do that. of course he would have been out to find another way, maybe fly it until it runs out of fuel or something, but you know. keep anticipating all the large number of trajectories that can go negative, all those kinds of running into the alps and try to at least make it easy for the engineers to build systems that are protecting us. yeah, and let's just think, so what in the computer world right now with kyde-ls, let's just not think about what i'm doing right now. what i'm doing right now is completely open, right? everyone's gonna know kyde-ls and be playing with them, making them more easier and easier and easier. but what we're gonna start to do, it makes sense to encrypt the kyde-ls in such a way that let's say you work for a pharmaceutical company and you have a license to make a given molecule. well, you get issued with a license by the fda or your local authority and they'll say, right, your license to do it, here it is, it's encrypted and the kyde-l gets run. so you have a license for that instance of use. easy to do, computer science has already solved the problem. so the fact that we all trust online banking, right? the right now, then we can secure it. i'm 100 sure we can secure the computer because of the way we have a many, it's the same mapping problem that you to actually reverse engineer a kyde-l will be as hard as reverse engineering the encryption key, brute force, it will be cheaper to just actually buy the regulated medicine. and actually people aren't gonna want to then make their own fake pharmaceuticals because it'll be so cheap to do it. we'll drop the cost of access to drugs. now what will happen, recreational drugs. people start saying, well, i want access to recreational drugs. well, it's gonna be up to, it's gonna accelerate that social discussion that's happening in the us and canada and uk, everywhere, right? because cost goes down, access goes up. given cannabis, thc, to some people who've got epilepsy isn't literally, forgive the term, a no-brainer because these poor people go from seizures every day to maybe seizures just once every few months. that's an interesting idea to try to minimize the chance that it can get into the hands of individuals, terrorists or people that want to do harm. now with that kind of thing, you're putting a lot of power in the hands of governments, in the hands of institutions. and so then emerge the kind of natural criticism you might have of governments that can sometimes use these for ill, use them as weapons of war, not weapon, not tools of betterment. so, and sometimes not just war against other nations, but war against its own people has been done throughout history. well, i'm thinking, so there's another way of doing it, a decentralized peer-to-peer version where, and what you have to do, i'm not saying you should adopt a blockchain, but there is a way of maybe taking kydls and put them in blockchain. here's an idea, let's just say, the way we're doing it in my lab right now is we go to the literature, we take a recipe to make a molecule, convert that to kydl, and diligently make it in the robot and validate it. we, that, so we, that i would call mining, proof of work, proof of synthesis, right? proof of the synthesis, that'd be cool. yeah, yeah, but this is cool because certainly, when you actually synthesize it, you can get the analytical data, but there's also a fingerprint in there of the impurities that get carried across, because you can never make one something 100 pure. that fingerprint will allow you to secure your kydl. so what you do is encrypt those two things. so suddenly you can have people out there mining, and what you could do, perhaps, is do the type of thing, we need to basically look at the way that contact tracing should have been done in covid, where people are given the information. so you've just been in contact with someone covid, you choose, i'm not telling you to stay at home, you choose, right? so now, if we could imagine a similar thing, you have got access to these chemicals, so you will have these effects, you choose and publicize it, or maybe it's out somewhere, i don't know. i'm not a policymaker on this. and my job here is to not just make the technology possible, but to have it as open as a discussion as possible with people to say, hey, can we stop childhood mortality with this technology? and to those benefits outweigh the one-off where people might use it for terrorism, or people might use it for recreational drugs. chemify, which is the name of the entity that will make this happen, i think we have some social responsibilities as an entity to make sure that we're not enabling people to manufacture personal drugs, weapons at will. and what we have to do is have a discussion with society, with the people who invest in this, with people that are gonna pay for this, to say, well, do you wanna live longer? and do you wanna be healthier? and are you willing to accept some of the risks? and i think that's a discussion to have. so by the way, when you say personal drugs, do you mean the illegal ones? or do you have a concern of just putting the manufacturer of any kind of legal drugs in the hands of regular people, because they might, dose matters, they might take away too much? i mean, i would say, to be honest, that the chances of computers being, well, should always never, so the fact i can now say this means it's totally gonna come true, right? i'm going to do it. i cannot imagine that computers will be in people's houses anytime soon, but they might be at the local pharmacy, right? and if you've got a drug manufacturing facility in every town, then you just go and they give you a prescription. they do it in such a way, they format it so that you don't have to take 10 pills every day. you get one manufactured for you that has all the materials you need and the right distribution. got it. but you mentioned recreation drugs. and the reason i mentioned it, because i know people are gonna speak up on this. if the drug is legal, there's to me no reason why you can't manufacture, i mean, for recreation. i mean, you can do it right now. what do you have against fun lee? so, i mean, i'm a chemistry professor in a university who's an entrepreneur as well. i just think i need to be as responsible as i can in the discussion. sure. not sure, sure. but i know, so let me be the one that says, there's nothing, because you have said recreational drugs and terrorism in the same sentence. yeah, yeah, okay. i think let's make sure we draw a line that there's real dangers to the world of terrorists, of bio warfare, and then there's a little bit of weed. so, i have, i mean, i think it's up to the society to tell its governments what it wants, what's acceptable. right? and if it becomes, let's say that thcs become heavily acceptable and that you can modify them. so, let's say it's blood type. there's a particular type of thc that you tolerate better than i do. then why not have a machine that makes the one you ? yeah. and then, and why not? it's the perfect brownie. and i think that that's fine. but i'm, you know, we're so far away from that. i can barely get the thing to work in the lab, right? and i mean, it's reliability and all this other stuff. but what i think is gonna happen in the short term, it's gonna turbocharge molecular discovery, reliability, and that will change the world. that's super exciting. you have a draft of a paper titled autonomous intelligent exploration, discovery and optimization of nanomaterials. so, we are talking about automating engineering of nanomaterials. how hard is this problem? and as we continue down this thread of the positives and the worrisome, what are the things we should be excited about? and what are the things we should be terrified about? and how do we minimize the chance of the terrifying consequences? so in this robot, the robot does all the heavy lifting. so the robot basically is an embodied ai. i really ai in a domain-specific way. one of the, as you should say at this point, there was an attempt in the 60s, joshua leidenberg and some really important people did this that made an ai to try and guess if organic molecules in a mass spectrum were alien or not. yes. and they failed because they didn't have assembly theory. i see. and when i- wait, wait, what does assembly theory give you about alien versus human life? well, no, it just, it tells you about unknown, the degree of unknown. so you can fingerprint stuff. they weren't looking at, they were trying to basically just look at the corpus of complex organic molecules. so when i was a bit down about assembly theory, because i couldn't convince referees and couldn't convince computational, people interested in computational complexity, i was really quite depressed about it. and i mean, i've been working with sarah walker's team and i think she also invented assembly theory in some way. we can talk about it later. when i found the ai not working for the dendrel project, i suddenly realized i wasn't totally insane. coming back to this nano robot. so what it does is it basically, a computer, but now what it does is it squirts a liquid with gold in it in the test tube and it adds some reducing agents, so some electrons to make the gold turn into a nanoparticle. now, when gold becomes a nanoparticle, it gets a characteristic color, a plasmon. so it's a bit if you look at the sheen on the gold wedding ring or gold bar or something, those are the ways of conducting electrons basically reflect light. what we did is we randomly squirt the gold particle and the reducing agent in and we measure the uv, we measure the color. and so what we do is we've got the robot has a mind, so it has a mind where in a simulation, it randomly generates nanoparticles and the plasmon, the color that comes out, randomly imagines in its head. so that's the imaginary side of the robot. in the physical side of the robot, it squirts in the chemicals and looks at the color and it uses a genetic algorithm and a map elite actually on it and it goes around in cycles and refines the color to the objective. now we use two different points. we have an exploration and an optimization. they're two different. so the exploration just says, just do random stuff and see how many different things you can get. and when you get different things, try and optimize and make the peak sharper, sharper, sharper. and what it does after a number of cycles is it physically takes a sample of the optimized nanomaterial, resets all of the round bottom flasks, cleans them and puts the seed, physical seed back in. and then what this robot is able to do is search a space of 10 to the 23 possible reactions in just a thousand experiments in three days. and it makes five generations of nanoparticles which get nicer and nicer in terms of shape and color and definition. and then at the end it outputs a kydeo code. the then being- wow, it's doing the search for programs in the physical space. so it's doing a kind of reinforcement learning. yeah, yeah, in the physical space. with the exploration and the optimization. and that kydeo will work on any computer or any qualified hardware. now that's it, now that's a general piece of code that can replicate somewhat, maybe perfectly what it created. that's amazing, that's incredible. but the nanoparticles themselves are dumb. the robot has all the thinking. so we don't try and imply any self replication or try and get the particles to make themselves. although it would be cool to try. so, well, there you go. that's, those are famous last words for the end of human civilization. would be cool to try. so is it possible to create molecules that start approaching this question that we started this conversation, which is the origin of life. to start to create molecules that have lifelike qualities. so have the replication, have complex, start to create complex organisms. so we have done this with the oxides. i talked about earlier with the limton oxides and the rings and the bulls. and the problem is that what they are, they do, they autocadalytically enhance one another. so they would, i guess you would call it self replication. but because there's limited function and mutation, they're pretty dumb. so they don't do very much. so i think the prospect of us being able to engineer a nanomaterial life form in the short term, i said earlier, my aim is to do this, of course. i mean, on one hand i'm saying it's impossible and the other hand i'm saying i'm doing it. so which is it, lee? it's , well, i think we can do it, but only in the robot. so the causal chain that's gonna allow it is in the robot. these particles, if they do start to self replicate, the system's gonna be so fragile that i don't think anything dangerous will come out. it doesn't mean we shouldn't treat them as potentially, i mean, i don't want to scare people gain of function, we're gonna produce stuff that comes out. our number one kill switch is that we always try to search a space of objects that don't exist in the environment. so even if something got out, it just would die immediately. it's making a silicon life form or something. which is the opposite of oftentimes gain of function research just focused on how do you get a dangerous thing to be closer to something that works with humans. yeah. and then you have a jump to humans. so that's the one good mode to operate on is always try to operate on chemical entities that are very different than the kind of chemical environment that humans operate in. yeah, and also, i mean, i'll say something dramatic, which may not be true, so i should be careful. if let's say we did discover a new living system and it was made out of a shadow biosphere and we just released it in the environment, who cares? it's gonna use different stuff. it'll just live. just live, yeah. i found one of my biggest fantasies is actually is a planet. there's basically half in the sun, it doesn't rotate, right? and you have two different origins of life on that planet. and they don't share the same chemistry. yeah. and then the only way time they recognize each other is when they become intelligent, they go, well, what's that moving? yeah. i wonder if it- they co-evolve, that's fascinating. i mean, so one fascinating thing to do is exactly what you were saying, which is a life bomb, which is try to focus on atmospheres or chemical conditions of other planets and try within this kind of exploration optimization system, try to discover life forms that can work in those conditions. and then you send those life forms over there and see what kind of stuff they build up. like you can do a large scale, it's kind of a safe physical environment to do large scale experiments. it's another planet. yeah, so look, i'm gonna say something quite contentious. i mean, elon wants to go to mars. i think it's brilliant wants to go to mars, but i would count on that and say, is elon just obsessed with getting humanized? humanity or earth or what about just technology? so if we do technology, so elon either needs to take a computer to mars because he needs to manufacture drugs on demand, right? because zero cost payload and all that stuff is just code. or what we do is we actually say, hang on, it's quite hard for humans to survive on mars. why don't we write a series of origin of life algorithms where we embed our culture in it, right? it's a very ridley spot prometheus, right? which is a terrible film by the way, but anyway. and dump it on mars and just terraform mars. and what we do is we evolve life on mars that is suited to life on mars. rather than brute forcing human life on mars. so one of the questions is, what is human culture? what are the things you encode? some of it is knowledge, some of it is information. but the thing that elon talks about and the thing i think about, i think you think about as well is some of the more unique aspects of what makes us human, which is our particular kind of consciousness. so he talks about the flame of human consciousness. that's one of the questions is, can we instill consciousness into other beings? because that's a sad thought that whatever this thing inside our minds that hopes and dreams and fears and loves can all die. yeah, but i think you already know the answer to that question. i have a robot lawn mower at home. my kids call it cc, cool car. it's a robot mow. and the way it works, it has an electric field around the perimeter and it just tell it the area. and it goes out and goes from its base station, just mows a bit. gets to the perimeter, detects perimeter, then chooses a random angle, rotates around and goes on. yeah. but my kids call it cool cutter. it's a she. i don't know why it's a she. they just, when they were quite young, they called it, i don't want to be sexist there. it could be a he, but they liked. they gendered the lawn mower. they gendered the lawn mower. okay. yeah, why not? but i was thinking this lawn mower, if you apply integrated information theory to lawn mower, lawn mower is conscious. now, integrated information theory is that people say as a flawed way of measuring consciousness, but i don't think it is. i think assembly theory actually measures consciousness in the same way. consciousness is something that is generated over a population of objects of humans. consciousness didn't suddenly spring in. our consciousness has evolved together, right? the fact we're here and the robots we leave behind, they all have some of that. so we won't lose it all. sure, consciousness requires, we have many models being generated. it's not just one domain specific ai, right? i think the way it created consciousness, i'm going to say unashamedly, the best way to make a consciousness is in a chemical system because you just have access to many more states. and the problem right now, we're making silicon consciousness is you just don't have enough states. so there are more possible states, or sorry, there are more possible configurations possible in your brain than there are atoms in the universe. and you can switch between them. you can't do that on a core i10. it's got 10 billion, 12 billion, 14 billion transistors, but you can't reconfigure them as dynamically. well, you've shared this intuition a few times already that the larger number of states somehow correlates to greater possibility of life, but it's also possible the constraints are essential here. yeah, yeah. i mean, but coming back to the, you worry that something's lost, i agree. but i think that, you know, we will get to an agi, but i wonder if it's not, it can't be separate from human, it can't be separate from human consciousness because the causal chain that produced it came from humans. so what i kind of try and suggest heavily to people worry about the existential threat of ai saying, i mean, you put it much more elegantly earlier, we should worry about algorithms, dumb algorithms written by human beings on twitter, driving us insane, right? and doing acting in odd ways. yeah, i think intelligence, this is what i have been in eloquent in trying to describe it, partially because i try not to think too deeply through this stuff because then you become a philosopher, i still aspire to actually building a bunch of stuff. but my sense is super intelligence leads to deep integration into human society. so intelligence is strongly correlated, intelligence, the way we conceive of intelligence materializes as a thing that becomes a fun entity to have at a party with humans. so it's a mix of wit, intelligence, humor, intelligence, knowledge, ability to do reasoning and so on, but also humor, emotional intelligence, ability to love, to dream, to share those dreams, to play the game of human civilization, the push and pull, the whole dance of it, the whole dance of life. and i think that kind of super intelligent being is not the thing that worries me. i think that ultimately will enrich life. it's again, the dumb algorithms, the dumb algorithms that scale in the hands of people that are too, don't study history, that don't study human psychology and human nature, just applying too broadly for selfish near-term interests. that's the biggest danger. yeah, i think it's not a new danger, right? i now know how i should use twitter and how i shouldn't use twitter, right? i to provoke people into thinking. i don't want to provoke people into outrage. it's not fun. it's not a good thing for humans to do, right? and i think that when you get people into outrage, they take sides and taking sides is really bad. but i think that we're all beginning to see this. and i think that actually i'm very optimistic about how things will evolve because, i wonder how much productivity has twitter and social media has taken out of humanity? because how many now, i mean, so the good thing about twitter is it gives power. so it gives voice to minorities, right? and that's good in some degree, but i wonder how much voice does it give to all sorts of other problems that don't need this emerge? by the way, when you say minorities, i think, or at least if i were to agree with you, what i would say is minorities broadly defined any small groups of people that, it magnifies the concerns of the small versus the big. that is good to some degree. but i think, i mean, i have to be careful because i think i have a very, i mean, i think that the world isn't that broken, right? i think the world is pretty cool place. i think academia is really great. i think climate change presents a really interesting problem for humanity that we will solve. i how you said it's a pretty cool problem for civilization. it's a big one. well, it's a bunch of, i wanna- there's a bunch of really, really big problems that if solved can significantly improve the quality of life or learn, that ultimately is what we're trying to do, improve how awesome life is for the maximum number of people. yeah, and i think that the coming back to consciousness, i don't think the universe is doomed to heat death, right? it's one of the optimists. that's why i want to kind of nudge you into thinking that time is fundamental because if time is fundamental, then suddenly you don't have to give it back. the universe just constructs stuff. and what we see around us in our construction, i know everyone's worried about how fragile civilization is. and i mean, look at the fundamentals. we're good until the sun expands, right? we've got quite a lot of resource on earth. we're trying to be quite cooperative. humans are nice to each other when they're not under enormous stress. but coming back to the consciousness thing, are we going to send human beings to mars or conscious robots to mars? or are we gonna send some hybrid? and i don't know the answer to that question right now. i guess, you know, elon's gonna have a pretty good go at getting there. i'm not sure whether, i have my doubts, but i'm not qualified. you know, i'm sure people have their doubts that computation works, but i've got it working. and i, you know. and most of the cool technologies we have today and take for granted, the airplane, a aforementioned airplane, were things that people doubted. every, majority of people doubted before they came to life and they come to life. and speaking of hybrid ai and humans, it's fascinating to think about all the different ways that hybridization, that merger can happen. i mean, we have, currently have the smartphones, so there's already a hybrid, but there's all kinds of ways that hybrid happens, how we and other technology play together, a computer, how that changes. the fabric of human civilization is wide open. who knows? who knows? if you remove, if you remove cancer, if you remove major diseases from humanity, there's going to be a bunch of consequences we're not anticipating. many of them positive, but many of them negative. many of them, most of them, at least i hope, are weird and wonderful and fun in ways that are totally unexpected. and we sitting on a porch with a bottle of jack daniels and a rocker will say, kids these days don't appreciate how hard we had it back in the day. i gotta ask you, speaking of nudging, you and josje bach nudge each other on twitter quite a bit in wonderful intellectual debates. and of course, for people who don't know josje bach, he's this brilliant guy. he's been on the podcast a couple of times. you tweeted, or he tweeted, josje bach, everyone should follow him as well. you should definitely follow mr. lee cronin, dr. lee cronin. he tweeted, dinner with lee cronin. we discussed that while we can translate every working model of existence into a turing machine, the structure of the universe might be given by wakes of non-existence in a pattern generated by all possible automata which exist by default. and then he followed on saying face to face is the best. so the dinner was face to face. what is josje talking about in wakes, quote, wakes of non-existence in a pattern generated by all possible automata which exist by default. so automata exists by default, apparently. and then there's wakes of non-existence. what the hell is non-existence in the universe? that's, and also in another conversation, you tweeted, it's state machines all the way down, which presumably is the origin story of this dinner discussion. and then josje said, again, nudging, nudging, nudging slash trolling. josje said, you've seen the light, welcome friend. many foundational physicists effectively believe in some form of hypercomputation. lee is coming around to this idea. and then you said, i think there are notable differences. first, i think the universe does not have to be a computer. second, i want to understand how the universe emerges, constructors that build computers. and third is that there is something below church touring. okay, what the heck is this dinner conversation about? maybe, and put another way, maybe zooming out a little bit, are there interesting agreements and disagreements between you and josje bach that can elucidate some of the other topics we've been talking about? yeah, so josje has an incredible mind and he's so well-read and uses language really elegantly. it bamboozles me at times. so often i'm describing concepts in a way that i built from the ground up. and so we misunderstand each other a lot. and he's floating in the clouds, is that what you're saying? something , not quite, but i think so. this concept of a turing machine. so turing machines, i would argue, and i think this is not, the turing machine, the universe is not a turing machine. biology is not even a turing machine, right? and because turing machines don't evolve, right? there is this problem that people see turing machines everywhere, but isn't it interesting, the universe gave rise to biology, that gave rise to intelligence, that gave rise to alan turing, who invented the abstraction of the turing machine and allowed us to digitize. and so i've been looking for the mystery at the origin of life, the origin of intelligence, and the origin of this. and when i discussed with josje, i think josje, he was saying, well, the universe, of course, the universe is a turing machine. of course, there's a hypercomputer there. and i think we got kind of trapped in our words and terms because of course it's possible for a turing machine or computers to exist in the universe. we have them. but what i'm trying to understand is, where did the transition of continuous discrete occur? and this is because of my general foolishness of understanding the continuous. but i guess what i'm trying to say is, there were constructors before there were abstractors, because how did the universe abstract itself into existence? and it goes back to earlier saying, could the universe of intelligence have come first? what's a constructor? what's an abstractor? so the abstractor is the ability of, say, of alan turing and gödel and church to think about the mathematical universe and to label things. and then from those labels to come up with a set of axioms with those labels and to basically understand the universe mathematically and say, okay, i can label things. where did the label come from? where is the prime labeler? even if the universe is not a turing computer, does that negate the possibility that a turing computer can simulate the universe? like, just because the abstraction was formed at a later time, does that mean that abstraction, this is to our cellular automata conversation. you were taking away some of the magic from the cellular automata because very intelligent biological systems came up with that cellular automata. well, this is where the existence is the default, right? is it, does the fact that we exist and we can come up with a turing machine, does that mean the universe has to be a turing machine as well? but can it be a turing machine though? that's a, so there has to be and it can't be. can it be? sure. i don't know, i don't understand if it has to be or not. can it be? but can the universe have turing machines in it? sure. they exist now. i'm wondering though, maybe, and this is really if things get really hairy, is i think the universe, maybe in the past, did not have the computational power that it has now. this is almost a law of physics kind of, so the computational power is not, you can get some free lunch? yeah, i mean, the fact that we now, we sit here in this period in time and we can imagine all these robots and all these machines and we built them. and so we can easily imagine going back in time that the universe was capable of having them, but i don't think it can. so the universe may have been a lot dumber computationally? and i think that's why i don't want to go back to the time discussion, but i think it has some relationship with it. the universe is basically smarter now than it used to be and it's gonna continue getting smarter over time because of novelty generation and the ability to create objects within objects within objects. you know, there's a, perhaps it's grounded in physics, there's this intuition of conservation, that stuff is conserved. like you're not, you've always had all, everything, you're just rearranging books on the bookshelf through time. so, okay. you're saying new books are being written. which laws you wanna break? at the origin of the big bang, you had to break the second law because we got order for free. well, what i'm telling you now is that the energy isn't conserved in the universe. oh, it was the second law. okay, i got you. so because, but not in a mad way. okay, so computation potentially is not conserved, which is a fascinating idea. intelligence is not conserved. complexity is not conserved. mm-hmm. i suppose that's deeply connected to time being fundamental. the natural consequence of that is if time is fundamental and the universe is inflating in time, if you , then there are one or two conservation laws that we need to have a look at. and i wonder if that means the total energy of the universe is actually increasing over time. and i might, this may be completely ludicrous, but we do have all this dark energy that's, we have some anomalies, let's say, dark matter and dark energy. if we don't add them in, galaxy, it's so dark matter, i think, doesn't hold, you know, you need to hold the galaxies together and there's some other observational issues. could dark energy just be time? so figuring out what dark energy is might give us some deep clues about this, not just time, but the consequences of time. yeah, so it could be that, i mean, i'm not saying there's perpetual motions allowed in this free lunch, but i'm saying, if the universe is intrinsically asymmetric and it appears to be, and it's generating novelty and it appears to, couldn't that just be mechanistically how reality works? mm-hmm. and therefore, i don't really this idea that the, and so i want to live in a deterministic universe that is undetermined. yeah. right? the only way i can do that is if time is fundamental. because otherwise, it's all the rest of it's just, it's just sleight of hand because the physicist will say, yes, everything's deterministic, newton is, newtonian mechanics is deterministic, quantum mechanics is deterministic, let's take the everrhenium view. and then basically we can just draw out this massive universe branching but it closes again and we get it all back. and don't worry, you're feeling a free will is effective. but what the physicists are actually saying is the entire future is mapped out and that is clearly problematical. and clearly... that's not so clear. yeah. it's just, it's just problematic. it, well, yeah, yeah, so it's... because that maybe is just the way it is. it's problematic to you, a particular creature along the way. i want to reduce the number of beliefs i need to understand the universe. so if time is fundamental, i don't need to have magic order at the beginning and i don't need a second law. but you do need the magical belief that time is fundamental. well, i need the, i need the observation that i'm seeing to be just the how it is all the way down. but the earth also looks flat if you, if you agree with your observation. so we can't necessarily trust our observation i know the earth isn't flat because i can send this satellite into space. i can fly. no, but now you see, now you're using the tools of science and the technology of science. but i'm using, but i'm saying i'm going to do experiments that start to show. i mean, i think that it's worth, so if you can't... so if i cannot do an experiment or a thought experiment that will test this assumption, then the assumption is without merit really in the end. you know, that's, it's fine. yeah. so... that's a beautiful idea you made. that's a beautiful idea you hold yourself to. that's, that's a, that's given that you think deeply in a philosophical way, you think about some of these really important issues and you have theoretical frameworks, assembly theory. it's really nice that you're always grounded with experiment. that's all i have. that's so refreshing. that's so beautifully refreshing. now that we're holding you to the grounded and experiment to the harsh truth of reality, let me ask the big ridiculous question. what is the meaning of this whole thing? what's the meaning of life? why? this time is fundamental. it's marching forward and along this long timeline, come along a bunch of descendants of apes that have come up with cellular automata and computers and now computers. why? i have so many different answers to this question. it depends on what day. i would say that given the way of the conversation we had today, i'd say the meaning. well, we make our own meaning. i think that's fine. but i think the universe wants to explore every possible configuration that it's allowed us to explore. and this goes back to the kind of question that you're asking about yasha and the existence and non-existence of things, right? so if the universe is a turing machine that's churning through a lot of states and you think about combinatorial theory before assembly theory, so everything is possible. what yasha and i were saying is, well, not everything is possible. we don't see the combinatorial explosion. we see something else. and what we see is evidence of memory. so there clearly seems to be some interference between the combinatorial explosion of things and what the universe allows. and it's this kind of constructive, destructive interference. so maybe the universe is not just about, it is assembling objects in space and time. and those objects are able to search more space and time. and the universe is just infinitely creative. and i guess i'm searching for why the universe is infinitely creative, is it infinitely creative? and maybe the meaning is just simply to make as many objects, create as many things as possible. and i see a future of the universe that doesn't result in the heat death of the universe. the universe is gonna extract every ounce of creativity it can out of it, because that's what we see on earth, right? and if you think that, almost intelligence is not conserved, that maybe creativity isn't either. maybe , it's an infinite well. so creativity is ultimately tied to novelty. you're coming up with cool new configurations of things, and maybe that just can continue indefinitely. and this human species that was created along the way is probably just one method, that's able to ask the universe about itself. it's just one way to explore creativity. maybe there's other meta levels on top of that. like obviously as a collective intelligence will create organisms, maybe there'll be organisms that ask themselves questions about themselves in a deeper, bigger picture way that we humans do. first to ask questions about the humans, and then construct some kind of hybrid systems that ask themselves about the collective aspect. just some weird stacking that we can't even imagine yet. and that stacking, i mean, i have discussed this stacking a lot with sarah walker, who's a professor of physics and astrobiology at asu. and we argue about how creative the universe is gonna be, and is it as deterministic as all that, because i think she's more of a free will thinker, and i'm of a less free will thinker, but i think we're beginning to converge and understanding that. because there's simply a missing understanding. right now we don't understand how the universe, we don't know what rules the universe has to allow the universe to contemplate itself. so asking the meaning of it before we even know what those rules are is premature. but my guess is that it's not meaningless, and it isn't just about that. and there are three levels of meanings. obviously the universe wants us to do stuff. we're interacting with each other, so we create meaning in our own society, in our own interactions with humanity. but i do think there is something else going on. but because reality is so weird, we're just scratching at that. and i think that we have to make the experiments better, and we have to perhaps join across, not just for the computation lists. and what i tried to do with yasha is meet him halfway, say, well, what happens if i become a computation list? what do i gain? a lot, it turns out, because i can make turing machines in the universe. because on the one hand, i'm making computers, which are state machines inspired by turing. on the other hand, i'm saying they can't exist. well, clearly i can't have my cake and eat it, so there's something weird going on there. so then, did the universe have to make a continuous to discrete transition, or is the universe just discrete? it's probably just discrete. so if it's just discrete, then there are, i will then give yasha his turing- property in the universe, but maybe there's something else below it, which is the constructor that constructs a turing machine, that then constructs, you know, it's a bit you generate a computing system that then is able to build an abstraction that then recognizes, it can make a generalizable abstraction, because human beings, with mathematics, have been able to go on and build physical computers, if that makes any sense. and i think that's the meaning. i think that's, you know, as far as we can, the meaning will be further elucidated with further experiments. well, you mentioned sarah. i think you and sarah walker are just these fascinating human beings. i'm really fortunate to have the opportunity to be in your presence, to study your work, to follow along with your work. i'm a big fan. like i told you offline, i hope we get a chance to talk again with perhaps just the two of us, but also with sarah. that's a fascinating dynamic for people who haven't heard, i suppose on clubhouse is where i heard you guys talk, but you have an incredible dynamic. and i also can't wait to hear you and yasha talk. so i think if there's some point in this predetermined or yet to be determined future, where the three of us, you and sarah, or the four of us with yasha could meet and talk would be a beautiful future. and i look forward to most futures, but i look forward to that one in particular. lee, thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today. thanks, lex. it's been a pleasure. thanks for listening to this conversation with lee cronin. to support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. and now let me leave you with some words from the mad scientist rick sanchez of rick and morty fame. to live is to risk it all. otherwise, you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': 'we will discover how it differs from panel or cross-sectional data and why time-series analysis is tricky. after that, well introduce you to some of the most basic time-series notation and terminology. all of this should give you a good idea of the role time series play in data science! lets begin with the definition. what is a time series? a time series is a sequence of information that attaches a time period to each value. the value can be pretty much anything measurable that depends on time in some way, prices, humidity, or a number of people. as long as the values we record are unambiguous, any medium could be measured with time series. what are some prominent features of time series? time period for starters, there arent any limitations regarding the total time span of a time series. it could be a minute, a day, a month, or even a century. all thats needed is a starting and an ending point. of course, there are usually numerous points in-between and the interval of time separating two consecutive ones is called a time period. for example, if the data was recorded once per day from 112000 to new years eve 2009, a single time period would be a day, while the entire time span would be a decade. frequency the frequency of the dataset tells us how often the values of the data set are recorded. to be able to analyse time series in a meaningful way, all time-periods must be equal and clearly defined. this, in turn, results in a constant frequency, so you see how the two features are related. this frequency is a measurement of time and could range from a few milliseconds to several decades. however, the ones we most commonly encounter are daily, monthly, quarterly and annual. patterns lastly, patterns observed in time-series are expected to persist in the future. that is why we often try to predict the future by analysing recorded values. now that youre familiar with the main features of time-series data, lets look at some examples. how do we use time series data in weather prediction? meteorologists often cope with the task of forecasting the weather for days ahead. to make even remotely accurate predictions on a consistent basis, they rely on analysing past data. that said, if the data is not ordered chronologically, finding the correct pattern would be extremely difficult. for instance, simply knowing the highest temperature for the last 5 days would be useless unless we know which value corresponds to each day. why? because chances that the temperature rose 5 days in a row or dropped 5 days in a row are equal. thus, without the corresponding time periods for each value, the data is much less relevant. how do we use time series data in business? time series data in finance in the world of business, time-series data is largely applied in finance. for investors, as well as company owners, its crucial to determine whether prices, returns, profits, and sales will increase or decrease in the future. therefore, a common topic in time-series analysis is determining the efficiency and stability of financial markets and portfolios. for instance, if we can accurately predict the prices of market indexes from past values, then these markets arent very efficient. time series data in sales forecasting another application of time series in business comes in the form of sales forecasting. in other words, were looking at trends from before to anticipate future demands. this enables companies to fill up their warehouses, so they dont run out of stock. additionally, it helps them adjust prices to make the biggest possible profit. a prime example of such behavior comes from airplane companies, which manipulate their prices depending on expected demand. this demand is forecasted using the demand from previous years and months, so it utilizes time-series data. if there is a significant relationship between past and present values, the one we just suggested, then we are dealing with time dependency. what is time dependency in time series data? time-series data is usually time-dependent. this means the values for every period are not only affected by outside factors, but also by the values of past periods. for instance, we expect tomorrows temperature outside to be within some reasonable proximity to todays values. furthermore, time-series data can suffer from seasonality. some values rain or temperature vary depending on the time of day and the season of the year. since its a repeating cycle, we can anticipate these changes and account for them when making our predictions. seasonality as a trait isnt often observed in regular data. and that is only logical. when there is no chronological order, we dont expect repeating cycles, right? how do we denote time series? in order to express time-series efficiently, we need to introduce some notation. we describe time-series variables with capital letters of the latin alphabet x or y. for example, we can label the prices of the sp 500 over some period of time as x. we describe the entire period covered by a time-series with capital t, while we use lower-case t to describe a single period within the interval. now, imagine we had the daily closing prices for the sp 500 for the entire 2008. given the uppercase t represents the entire year, the lower-case t would represent a single day. then, to denote the closing price on a specific day, we would use x of t. alternatively, we could simply write the precise date, time or year as a subscript. since t represents the order of the period we are interested in, we express the previous period as t minus 1. similarly, we express the next period as t plus 1. this notation is extremely helpful when trying to model time-series data to make predictions about the future. some final words all things considered, time-series data has many important applications in todays data-driven world. and, although this article is a great first introduction to the topic, its barely touching the surface', 'completion': 'written'}\n",

      "{'prompt': 'as we open this session of the general assembly the world is still facing problems of peace and security, crises, conflicts, inequality among states, poverty, hunger and disease. to those recurrent problems are added new challenges, such as climate change, natural disasters, terrorism, piracy, transnational organized crime, human trafficking, nuclear proliferation and the world economic and financial crisis. all these many issues by their very nature call out to the whole of the international community and demand global, collective, coordinated solutions. the united nations because of its global nature offers now more than ever the best framework for finding lasting solutions. to do that, we need a strong, reformed organization that can respond to the new demands of our time. in this connection, my delegation welcomes the new entity un women and the appointment at its head of the former president of chile, michelle bachelet a brilliant woman, to whom i wish every success. we will need to work with determination to bring about the reforms necessary to restore to the united nations its operation as a global organization and to make it a real instrument of world governance. the process must continue with reform of the security council, both in its membership and its working methods. also we should continue to deal with the matter of how to strengthen the general assembly and its role. the high-level plenary meeting on the millennium development goals (mdgs) that ended 22 september culminated in the adoption of an outcome document (resolution 651) that exhorts us to keep our promises. we welcome it. indeed, we must unite to attain these goals. as i said at that time, just two days ago, congos commitment to reaching the mdgs remains firm. while ten years after the goals were announced the overall results in achieving them are mixed, especially in africa, it is nevertheless undeniable that major advances have been made in africa during that same period in such other essential areas as peace, security and democracy. africa as a whole is increasingly emerging from a cycle of armed conflicts that have greatly worked against its forward progress towards development and prosperity. today, thanks to the efforts of the african union, the backing of the international community and the involvement of african leaders themselves, many conflicts have been or are being resolved. with that in mind, 2010 has been named a year of peace and security in africa. despite difficulties encountered here and there in carrying out electoral processes, in a general way democracy is undeniably making a home in africa. in gabon and burundi, to mention only those two countries, the popular will has expressed itself freely. we nurture the hope that the elections upcoming in the next months, notably in côte divoire, guinea, the niger, nigeria, the central african republic and the democratic republic of the congo, will play out in a climate of calm. that is likewise our hope for the referendum to be held in south sudan, as called for in the comprehensive peace agreement. in this connection we call on the international community to continue supporting that process until it is completed. on the subject of central africa, the united nations office about to open will provide an additional tool, besides existing mechanisms, to promote good governance and build peace, cooperation and development. in the same vein of building confidence and peace in our subregion, from 15-19 november brazzaville will be hosting the thirty-first meeting of the united nations standing advisory committee on security questions in central africa. on that occasion the states of the subregion will seal their commitment to fight the traffic in small arms and light weapons, by signing the kinshasa convention. since the tragic events that brought such suffering to my country in the 1990s and early 2000s, the congolese government has invested in the quest for peace and national reconciliation, and works to preserve that precious accomplishment. moreover, our good neighbour policy a policy we have always advocated is one of the pillars of our foreign policy. it is evident today in the way in which we are handling the humanitarian crisis resulting from the arrival in our territory of over 100,000 nationals from équateur province in the democratic republic of the congo. the signing this past 10 june of the tripartite accord among the republic of the congo, the democratic republic of the congo and the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees should make possible an imminent resolution of the problem and contribute to stabilizing the situation in our brother country so in need of peace and security, especially on the eve of its elections. 10-54965 56 here i would to thank the all the bilateral and multilateral partners, namely france, italy, the united states of america, the world food programme and the office of the high commissioner for refugees, for all the assistance they have graciously given us. we have just dedicated a high-level segment to biodiversity in this year 2010, which has been proclaimed the international year of biodiversity. yet another new challenge of our age, biodiversity is crucial to life on earth and holds especial interest for the congo, since we are one of the countries that houses the congo basin, a major carbon sink. we have no doubt that the results of this segment will resonate into the upcoming meetings in nagoya, japan, in october and in cancún, mexico, in november and december. the president of our republic, denis sassou nguesso, holds the question of biodiversity to be of critical global importance, because tropical forests play a vital role in regulating and stabilizing the global climate and generally in providing environmental services. in this context, the copenhagen agreement, which took into account the process of reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation, known as redd-plus, represented the culmination of major efforts deployed by the three forest basins, the amazon basin in south and central america, the congo basin in central africa and the mekong basin in south-east asia. with our partners in dialogue and cooperation of the forest eleven tropical rainforest countries, the republic of the congo reaffirms its will and determination to meet the challenges of conservation and the promotion of biodiversity. such an effort can bring about lasting results only if it is supported by additional financing that is sustainable and predictable. the question of human rights is also on the agenda for this session. my government promotes human rights because they are so closely related to peace and development. with regard to human rights, the congo has always acted within the process of international legitimacy. that is evident in the philosophy underpinning our constitution, in what we do on a day-to-day basis and in our extensive participation in the relevant international instruments. domestically, besides promulgating a law on the protection of the child in the republic of the congo, our parliament will shortly adopt a bill on promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples, which the government has just submitted to it. the republic of the congo has undertaken a number of initiatives in this field, thus taking an important step towards recognizing, defending and protecting the rights of minorities. next november, the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people will visit brazzaville. that will be an opportune moment for dialogue and consultations on matters related to indigenous peoples. it should also help us speed up the implementation of recommendations of the universal periodic review, a human rights council mechanism of which my country was the subject from 6 to 8 may 2009 in geneva. my country is a candidate for membership in the human rights council for the period from 2011 to 2014, and we thus reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling our international commitments and to supporting efforts of the international community to strengthening those rights. i therefore take this opportunity to appeal for the assemblys support for our candidacy in the elections, which will be held in may 2011. on 15 august 2010, my country celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of its independence. the day was devoted to the theme of remembering, but also and above all, of responsibilities and action. on that occasion, the government announced a number of socio-economic measures to benefit our people. those measures were made possible by the release of additional financial resources following the significant foreign debt relief because of congos accession to the heavily indebted poor countries (hipc) initiative. those measures are part of the governments resolve to move towards attaining the millennium development goals. such an enabling situation will allow my country to lay the foundations for an emerging economy. indeed, it is president denis sassou nguessos ambition to make congo a modern and prosperous state that plays its part in the family of free modern nations. but that ambition, however legitimate, can be achieved only in a world that is safer, more just and with more solidarity. more than ever before, we must return to the ideals that inspired the founding fathers of the league of nations and the united nations. we must place the 57 10-54965 moral values and the deep aspirations of our peoples at the heart of our work. this is the world that we all aspire to. this is the world that we should strive to build in this hall.', 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': 'mr. president, on behalf of the government and the people of the republic of trinidad and tobago, i extend congratulations to mr. ping on his election to the presidency of the general assembly at its fifty- ninth session. we are confident that his experience and diplomatic skills will enable him to discharge fully the weighty responsibilities of his office. permit me to convey to his predecessor, the honourable julian hunte, minister of foreign affairs of saint lucia, our deep appreciation of his efforts towards revitalization of the general assembly. i wish also to convey to our secretary-general, mr. kofi annan, the full support of the government and the people of trinidad and tobago as he continues the global initiatives of the united nations towards making the world better and safer for all humanity. today trinidad and tobago is celebrating its twenty-eighth anniversary as a republic. over our 42 years as an independent country, we have made significant strides in the development of our nation. we have maintained a strong tradition of democratic 7 governance through an increasingly inclusive and multiparty political system; by respecting fully the constitutionally entrenched and internationally recognized fundamental human rights and freedoms of the individual; and by ensuring strict adherence to the rule of law. we have sought increasingly to diversify our economic base. through consistent and sound macro- economic policies, together with prudent management and use of our resources, we have sustained more than a decade of positive economic growth, which last year was of the order of 13.2 per cent. our country has made significant strides in advancing the capabilities of our people through universal access to primary and secondary education. we have gone further through our state-sponsored preschool programme, which targets universal early childhood education by 2010, and by fully opening the gateway to tertiary education through support for every student, enhanced funding for deserving ones, and our recently established university of trinidad and tobago. our archipelagic republic, populated by 1.3 million people of african, indian, european, chinese, middle eastern and mixed ancestries, constitutes a veritable microcosm of the people of the world. however, we have been able to foster racial harmony and religious tolerance through the collective embrace of the diversity of our people. that approach, together with adherence to integrity and transparency in public affairs and equality of opportunity for all, has been essential to the continued peace, stability and progress we enjoy as we propose to make trinidad and tobago a beacon of integrity in the world. trinidad and tobago has demonstrated remarkable strength and resilience in the face of a global environment characterized by rapid economic, social and other changes; this has mobilized us to embark on the realization of a bold new vision in the pursuit of our developmental agenda. in that respect, our government and people are currently engaged in a highly participatory consultative process aimed at formulating a national strategic development plan to guide trinidad and tobago towards becoming a developed nation by the year 2020 or earlier. it is called vision 2020, and its agenda includes human capital development; the evolution of a technologically driven, knowledge-based society; the development of a highly productive and globally competitive economy; and, by the year 2020, the provision for all our citizens of a standard of living comparable to that enjoyed in developed countries. our achievements stand in indisputable testimony to what a small, independent nation such as ours can do in that regard. there is an instructive link between two of the features that today define and distinguish our country among others in the region. one is our oil and natural gas resources the foundation and mainstay of our economy; the other, the steelpan, our creation derived from heating and tuning the top of discarded oil drums. the steelpan is one of the most important musical instruments invented during the last century. we are proud to have created it, and equally so of its growing international recognition and popularity, which is an apt reflection of the phenomenal ingenuity of the peoples of developing countries. the same holds true in respect of achievements in our energy sector. at just over 130,000 barrels of oil per day, trinidad and tobagos production is not significant by international standards. our natural gas production, however, stands at 2.9 billion cubic feet per day, and that has propelled my country to become today the worlds largest exporter of methanol and also of ammonia. we are currently supplying 80 per cent of united states liquid natural gas imports out of our three trains, and we propose to leverage that fact towards caribbean regional development. we are also a critical supplier of energy to our caribbean neighbours. to further facilitate this, we are exploring the feasibility of several energy-related projects, including the establishment of a natural gas pipeline through the eastern caribbean. we have also entered into a joint venture with neighbouring venezuela to liquefy that countrys natural gas in trinidad and tobago. meanwhile, our iron and steel production facilities are being expanded. several new production facilities are in train, among them an ethylene production complex, an aluminium smelter project, and others for expanded ammonia and methanol production as well as other downstream petrochemical products. the combination of an attractive and enabling investment climate, available and affordable energy, a 8 strategic location vis-à-vis the north, central and south american and european markets, a population literacy level of over 90 per cent, and a sound work ethic, as well as a good communications infrastructure, continue to make trinidad and tobago one of the largest per-capita recipients of foreign direct investment in the hemisphere. indeed, last year we were the second-largest recipient after canada. like other countries we, too, have our fair share of challenges. for example, our strategic location less than nine miles off the south american coast and to the south of the caribbean island chain, with excellent air and sea transport links to major north atlantic cities renders trinidad and tobago highly vulnerable to trade in illegal drugs and firearms. combating narco-trafficking, drug-related crimes and the spread of hivaids is among our greatest challenges, but the government of trinidad and tobago remains resolute in its determination to eradicate those scourges. we continue to implement the measures necessary to fight them and are confident that we shall win the battle. our development agenda is not centred solely on the republic of trinidad and tobago. it is part and parcel of a pan-caribbean agenda to which we are irrevocably and solidly committed, and which takes into consideration the fullest development of the countries of our region. many historical and other ties bind our caribbean nations and we understand that the fundamental basis for our development lies in being able to work more closely together to exert a greater influence on our own as well as global development, which for centuries have been dictated by others. today, our level of functional cooperation in the region has increased over a range of areas and trinidad and tobago continues to play a central role at all levels. we therefore look forward to the operationalization of our newest caribbean institution, the caribbean court of justice, which will serve as the arbitral body for the soon-to-be-established caricom single market and economy, as well as the regions final appellate court, and will be headquartered in port of spain. the development of trinidad and tobago and caricom are intertwined. caricom is our second largest export market after the united states of america, absorbing close to 20 per cent of our exports. our share of regional trade grew to 80 per cent in 2001. since 1996, we have contributed approximately us$ 1.4 billion in assistance to caribbean states through a variety of mechanisms including capital market activities, foreign direct investment, debt relief, and direct assistance. last year we provided us$ 505 million in loans to companies and governments in the region, some of whom have difficulty in borrowing on the international market. in addition, we have recently established a new grant facility, to be based on sales of petroleum products to the region, which will be dedicated to poverty eradication within caricom. my country sees the development of the caribbean, our second largest market, as integral to the development of trinidad and tobago. even so, our national and regional development efforts require an international economic environment of greater sensitivity, one facilitating a more beneficial integration of developing countries into the world economy. in that regard, as sanguine as we are about the future of trinidad and tobago, i must on this occasion take a stand in the interest of the beleaguered nations of the caribbean. how often have small independent states preached from this very mountaintop of the need for multilateral trading arrangements that take into account the inherent vulnerabilities of small island developing states, and consequently the need to be accorded special and differential treatment? there is a notable reluctance of some partner countries to respond accordingly, and that continues to have negative consequences, especially for the small economies of the caribbean. trinidad and tobago therefore stands resolute with our developing country partners in calling for what must be conceived of as the application of a social conscience within the management of globalization and its processes. as capital importing economies, the developing countries of the caribbean are only too well aware, sometimes painfully so, of the implications of capital shortage for the generation of employment and the provision of housing, education and health care for our citizens. and perhaps i speak even for those yet unborn. it is through softer trading arrangements, increased financial flows and the consequent empowerment of our citizens that we will be able to realize the most central of all the millennium development goals, the eradication of poverty. the implications are clear. the course on which some of our european union (eu) country partners are 9 embarked will render the achievement of our millennium development goals more difficult. in speaking of those goals our attention is now drawn to haiti, our newest caricom member, where over 1,000 people died from the onslaught of hurricane jeanne, further aggravating the tremendous problems that that nation already suffers. trinidad and tobago therefore welcomes the decision taken by the security council in its resolution 1542 (2004) of 30 april 2004 to establish the united nations stabilization mission in haiti. we also support the recent decision by the economic and social council to reactivate its ad hoc advisory group on haiti to promote the coordination and development of a long-term programme of assistance to that country. we believe that those efforts by the international community will contribute significantly to the stability and urgently needed development of haiti. at this juncture, however, haiti needs a tremendous outpouring of international humanitarian assistance. the same holds true for grenada and several other caribbean states whose misfortune it was to have been visited by ivan, the terrible. on 8 september, hurricane ivan descended on grenada. in less than two hours it had completely destroyed the economy and infrastructure of grenada, ravaging that country beyond description. ninety percent of the buildings on the island were damaged or destroyed. a primarily agricultural economy, dependent also on tourism, all of grenadas crops disappeared with the strong wind. caricom leaders were recently advised by a grenadian representative that today grenada has no gross domestic product. before visiting grenada, hurricane ivan sowing varying amounts of disruption and destruction visited tobago and barbados. after grenada, it proceeded to saint vincent and the grenadines, jamaica, the cayman islands, cuba, bahamas and the southern united states. everywhere there was considerable damage, but grenada and the cayman islands were the hardest hit. before ivan, there was charley and frances. after ivan came jeanne, with death and destruction for puerto rico, the dominican republic and haiti. a number of caricom countries are now saddled with the immense challenge of trying to restore normalcy. permit me to ask, to what extent have these obvious climate changes been influenced by incursions into space from planet earth, or for that matter by ecological imbalances caused by industrialization? in the aftermath of the devastation visited on grenada, caricom countries have been rallying to the assistance of that island, and must be applauded for their massive outpouring of humanitarian aid that continues to flow to grenada. in that regard, permit me to recognize and applaud the most appropriate response of the secretary-general. trinidad and tobago pledges its support to our beleaguered caribbean neighbours, and we have thus committed ourselves through direct financial and other assistance. but what grenada and haiti require is well beyond the regions capacity to deliver. i urge the wider international community and donor agencies to respond adequately and to play their part. help is needed and needed now. the catastrophic events of the present hurricane season bring into sharper focus yet another dimension of the vulnerability of caribbean countries. the january 2005 international meeting in mauritius to review the implementation of the barbados programme of action must seek to comprehensively address the new and emerging threats to the sustainable development of small island developing states. the international community should take note that a whole new set of security issues have now arisen in the caribbean as a result of those developments. the answer to so many of our problems lies in multilateralism, if approached the right way. belief in and respect for multilateralism led to trinidad and tobagos respect for all major global and regional forums. today, we are active participants in the creation of the free trade area of the americas, which, when realized, will stretch from alaska in the north to tierra del fuego in the south, creating a market of more than 800 million consumers and generating tremendous opportunity for economic and social development. our regions commitment to that hemispheric integration process has led trinidad and tobago and its partners in the caribbean community (caricom) to propose our capital city, port-of-spain, as the ideal location for the seat of the proposed permanent secretariat of the free trade area of the americas. unanimous regional support for this caricom proposal would demonstrate the hemispheres 10 solidarity with one of its smaller members and give true meaning to the principle of the sovereign equality of all states. it would further decentralize the headquartering of major international and regional organizations and enable a small island developing state to place its resources at the service of the hemispheric community. accordingly, we look forward to receiving the support of all our neighbours in the hemisphere. we remain pleased with the progress of certain multilateral initiatives, including the new african partnership for development, which i urge caricom and african countries to support by exploring opportunities to develop investment, trade, tourism and regular transport routes between our region and the african continent. we also consider the establishment of the international criminal court to be a major achievement, and we urge partner countries to uphold the integrity of the rome statute. the commission of war crimes, genocide and other such crimes against humanity has been facilitated by a global culture of impunity. the people of the world will be safe only when the perpetrators of such crimes know that punishment is inescapable. trinidad and tobago condemns all forms and manifestations of terrorism, wherever and by whomever they are committed. we are already a party to the principal international legal instruments against terrorism, and the government will shortly take parliamentary action to enact legislation honouring our obligations with respect to the international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. as the international community continues to confront the many threats to the survival of mankind, the worlds political leadership must unequivocally reaffirm its commitment to the united nations so that the united nations can continue its role in fighting injustice, inequality, inequity and intolerance worldwide through resolute and speedy action, in respect of its commitment to the ideals for which it was founded. trinidad and tobago is of the view that the issue of united nations reform takes on even more urgency as the institution approaches the sixtieth anniversary of its founding in 1945. we therefore look forward to discussion of the secretary-generals recommendations based on the report of the high-level panel on threats, challenges and change, chaired by former prime minister anand panyarachun. in conclusion, i wish to propose that on 24 october, 2005, united nations day, a special commemorative meeting of the general assembly be held in san francisco, where our charter was signed, to reaffirm our commitment to the lofty ideals enunciated some 50 years ago, which are still valid today.', 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

for the exemplary manner in which he presided over our deliberations during a very eventful year. i wish to avail myself of this opportunity to express to our secretary-general my delegation's congratulations for his outstanding contribution in the pursuit of world peace and stability. he has succeeded in solving a number of pending regional crises and in improving the work of the secretariat under difficult financial constraints. he can rest assured of our continued support. this year we have witnessed the consolidation of peace processes. great progress has been made in relations between the united states and the soviet union. the treaty on the elimination of inter mediate-range and shorter-range missiles signed by the united states and the soviet union and ratified in june 1988 is a historic agreement because it is the first in recent history to abolish a whole category of nuclear weapons from the arsenals of the superpowers. in the sphere of multilateral disarmament the paris conference on chemical weapons, held in january this year, gave support and impetus to the geneva conference on disarmament. my delegation looks forward to the day when an effective and universal chemical-weapons convention banning the production, storage and use of such weapons can be implemented. my delegation notes with satisfaction the progress achieved in the negotiation on conventional arms in europe, proposals for military reductions and confidence-building measures have been admitted by both western and eastern groups at the recent vienna meeting. it is hoped that those talks will lead to an effective and concrete reduction in the armed forces and conventional weapons in that region. our concern for peace should be global, we must take advantage of the new rapport between washington and moscow to liquidate any area of tension and confrontation, wherever it happens to be. it is high time that the littoral and hinterland states of the indian ocean started the process of the demilitarisation of that ocean by calling for the convening of the long-overdue conference not later than 1990, with the active participation of all permanent meters of the security council as well as the major maritime powers. as the assembly is aware. the government and people of mauritius have not accepted the fact that an important part and parcel of their territory has been excised by the former colonial peer in contravention of united nations general assembly resolutions 1514 ,xv and 2066 (xx,. the dismemberment of mauritian territory constitutes an unacceptable affront to our sovereignty. mauritius cannot and .ill not remain silent until diego garcia and the chagos archipelago, as well as the tromelin islands. are returned to us. our claim is just and legitimate. we have the total support of the organisation of african unity and the movement of non-aligned countries, we appeal to the international community and to all peace-loving countries to assist us in the restoration of our territories. our islands should not serve as a nuclear base and should not constitute a threat to our own security and to that of all the littoral d hinterland states of the region. the current political situation in south africa calls for careful reflection and handling. we all agree that apartheid is the root cause of conflict in that region, and we have repeatedly called for its total elimination. it is a matter of comfort to note that many of our elder statesmen in africa are initiating contacts with the south african government in the true spirit of dialogue with a view to pressing that government to make the necessary changes to the satisfaction of one and all. we fervently hope that the changes promised by the new south african government are genuine and that it will soon embark on the total dismantling of apartheid and the establishment of a free, united and democratic society based on universal suffrage. we cannot accept that a leader of the calibre of nelson mandela should be eternally confined to house arrest simply because he dared to raise his voice against apartheid. we demand his immediate release and that of all political prisoners. the lifting of all political restrictions, the withdrawal of troops from black townships, the lifting of the state of emergency and the cessation of all political court proceedings can only help to create a climate of confidence for the pursuit of a real and meaningful dialogue between the south african government and its people. the opening of dialogue with the african national congress will be a test of the sincerity of the new south african government. the liberation of namibia has been a cause near and dear to us. mauritius has always stood firmly by security council resolution 435 (1978, and its reaffirmation this year in resolution 632 (1989), as well as the united nations plan for the independence of namibia. the united nations transition assistance group (untag, needs all our political and diplomatic support to lead and organize a smooth transition through free elections without interference and intimidation. we wish namibia and the valiant namibian people a new dawn and a bright and prosperous future. with the resolution of the namibian problem there was hope for a quick end to the conflict in angola. we note with much regret, however, that the recent gbadolite accord has failed to be given concrete effect, leaving the people of angola still in the grips of war. it is our fervent wish that peace will prevail in mozambique, which has endured untold sufferings for far too long, similarly, we greatly commend the initiative of president mubarak, the current chairman of the organization of african unity, to mediate in the tragic conflict between two neighbourly african countries, mauritania and senegal. my delegation last year rejoiced at the cessation of hostilities between the brotherly states of iran and iraq and their acceptance of the implementation of security council resolution 598 (1987). we pledge to support the secretary-general in his ceaseless efforts to quicken the pace of negotiations and entreat both parties to co-operate in good faith in order to reach a common understanding and a lasting peace between the two countries. we are deeply concerned over the deterioration of the situation in the middle east as a result of the continued israeli occupation of the west bank end the gaza strip, which poses a serious threat to international peace and security. we fully support the just struggle of the palestinian people and the palestine liberation organization (plo) for the recovery of their lost territory. the intifadah, which has been going on for nearly two years, has made it clear that the middle east stalemate cannot continue for ever. israel must negotiate with the sole and legitimate representative of the palestinian people, the plo. any attempt to create a local palestinian leadership in the west bank is doomed to failure. the plo's desire for peace has been expressed emphatically, at the palestinian national council meeting in algiers and at the united nations general assembly session in geneva last year. this has entailed a major shift in the attitude of many nations to the plo. tb prevent the tragic scenario in the middle east from deteriorating further into a global crisis, the convening of an international conference under the aegis of the united nations, with all parties, including the plo, in accordance with security council resolutions 242 (1967) and 335 (1973), is of the utmost necessity. no one can be insensible to the tragedy which has engulfed lebanon. such tragedies will recur unless and until we see the withdrawal of all external forces. the arab league, the tripartite committee on lebanon and the international community must continue their efforts towards bribing peace and security in this war-torn country. my delegation also deplores the fact that despite the korean people's aspirations for the peaceful reunification of their homeland, korea remains divided. this situation remains a great threat to peace. we welcome the efforts of the korean people to reunify their homeland peacefully without any foreign interference and by means of dialogue and consultations between the north and the south. the signing of the geneva agreements and the withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan had raised high hopes that peace would soon come to that country. my delegation notes with regret that the hopes have not been realized because of the non-observance of the spirit of the geneva agreements. afghanistan presents a harrowing picture of devastation, of a million dead and 5 million refugees. the flow of more, lethal weapons will not break the stalemate that has settled over the conflict. the civil war since the pullout by the soviet troops, during the last six months, has amply demonstrated that there can be no military solution to the afghan conflict. a political settlement is the only way out. we appeal to the united states and the soviet union, to bring the diverse elements together with a view to bringing an end to the present bloodshed in afghanistan and restoring peace under an afghan government of national reconciliation. my delegation welcomes the recent initiatives of the presidents of the five central american countries in their quest for peace and stability in that region. we are glad to learn that a united nations mission will be sent to observe the elections in nicaragua early next year. similarly, we commend the ceaseless efforts of the united nations secretary-general in bringing about the resumption of intercommunal talks in cyprus. we hope that a permanent and durable solution will be found, to the satisfaction of both communities there. we also wish to see peace and stability prevail in south-east asia. the people of cambodia have gone through great sufferings in recent years. the international conference in paris did not bring about the much-desired agreement between the parties engaged in the conflict. we still believe that all foreign troops should leave cambodia - and we welcome the withdrawal of the vietnamese troops - and that the cambodians should be given the opportunity to determine their destiny freely and without any hindrance. there should, however, be a guarantee that there will not be a return to the 'killing fields', to the genocide that still haunts the people of cambodia. it is an undeniable fact that the economies of the industrialized countries have been steadily growing during the last few years. unfortunately, the developing countries have not benefited from this growth. on the contrary - their economies have been declining. most countries in africa and latin america and several in asia have fallen into a deep and protracted crisis. their economic conditions are worsening, their social services are deteriorating, and the political stability is endangered. this negative trend in the world economy is likely to persist in the years to come unless decisive steps are taken globally. the combined effect of the debt problem and the scarcity of new financial flows has further exacerbated the economic crisis in the developing countries. african debt has risen sharply from $78 billion in 1980 to $230 billion in 1988. african countries are having to borrow more and more to service their debts, thus enduring more severe economic hardship, while we appreciate the gestures made by some industrialized countries, such as france, the united states. canada, the federal republic of germany and others, in alleviating the debt burdens of several of the most indebted developing countries, we cannot but re-emphasize that as long as the third world is made to retain the role of mere supplier of raw materials at non-remunerative prices, its future will continue to be bleak and the scourges of poverty, hunger, disease and illiteracy will continue to exist as we step into the next century. a redefinition of economic co-operation is therefore essential to the prevention of a further deterioration in the situation. economic relationships must be based on equality, partnership and interdependence. it is imperative that products originating in the third world countries should receive fair and remunerative prices and should not be subjected to various constraints. international agreements aimed at stabilizing prices of primary commodities must be negotiated and implemented. the countries of the industrialized world, which has the skills, the technical know-how and the economic means, are better placed to restructure their industries so as not to affect the nascent industries of third world countries, which otherwise will have to face severe competition. growth and prosperity can be realized only by these measures. such a liberalizing philosophy will mirror international solidarity and true partnership, m order to address adequately the pressing issue of international debt, there is an urgent need to reactivate the north-south dialogue and convene, as proposed by the recent summit conference of the non-aligned countries, an appropriate forum under the auspices of the united nations to review ail aspects of the problem of external debt within the context of an improved environment for development and international economic co-operation. we are deeply concerned by the state of the world environment. the warming of the atmosphere and the depletion of the ozone layer constitute a threat to the ecosystem which nay in turn affect the very existence of mankind. island countries which are already prone to natural disasters such as cyclones and hurricanes are now facing grave threats from the rising seas - which is a direct effect of environmental imbalances. furthermore, the oceans are being polluted by the irrational dumping of industrial wastes. unless immediate measures are taken to prevent the aggravation of the situation we shall run the risk of compromising an important source of food supplies and raw materials. while we welcome recent initiatives on global environmental issues, such as the montreal protocol on the ozone layer and the hague convention, and take note of the positive actions relating to dumping of toxic wastes, we urgently appeal for remedial measures to be taken in favour of the most affected regions and we call for international support and solidarity in checking the pollution of our environment. at the national level also, the protection and the preservation of the environment must become an important factor in the conception, implementation and execution of new projects and programmes. finally, i should to refer to a problem which has assumed alarming international proportions. drug trafficking and addiction, to which the problem of aids is intimately connected, is already the new scourge of mankind. my government has taken drastic measures to combat drug trafficking, and we will support all steps taken at the international level in this respect. we are almost on the threshold of a new millennium, and we have no doubt that the major intractable global problems facing mankind and our planet will be handled with wisdom, vision and foresight, bearing in mind the enlightened principles of the united nations charter. the challenges we face prompt us to arm ourselves with a spirit of solidarity enabling us to confront the future with confidence and serenity. man has survived many wars and conflicts, and i am confident that in the nuclear age he will be able to muster courage and fortitude and use the natural intelligence with which he has been endowed to keep premature death and destruction away from his doorstep. i conclude by reaffirming my faith in mankind's willingness and ability to survive and to create conditions for a better tomorrow.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"813 ies council bill 1477 has passed. councilman cashman, will you please put council bill 1539 on the floor? yes, mr. president. i move the council bill 18 dash 1539 be placed upon final consideration and do pass. has been moved and seconded. the public hearing for council bill 1539 is open. may we have the staff report? good evening. my name is karen with community planning and development and we are here for 5001 packing house road. it's also known as the armor and company administration building. landmark designation was established in 1967, which provides you the authority to designate properties within the city and county of denver. approximately 4 of the structures in the city are designated, or about one in 25 buildings. for this particular property, the owner is the city and county of denver and it is in the national western center, as you can see, as highlighted on the map in red. if you look down towards the bottom of the map, you can see the outline of the stadium arena. that is also a denver landmark. this particular property is in an area of change with its current zoning as i am x five with a use overlay of two. there is plain support for the designation in both the national western center master plan and the elyria swansea neighborhood plans, which both call out for the designation of historic structures. specifically the designation of structures within the national western center. and as you can see, the red box down there at the bottom is the stadium arena. and the small diamond up at the towards the top is the property that we are looking at for a property be designated per ordinance. it needs to meet a designation criteria in at least two of the following categories history, architecture and geography, and to maintain its historic and physical integrity. and then the lpc needs to consider how it relates to a historic context or theme. so for this particular property, it meets two criteria under history one under architecture and three or two under geography. in the first under history, it has a direct association with the historical development of the city, state or nation. this particular property is strongly associated with the meat processing facilities at the denver union stockyards. the armor building was the administration building for the armor and company. the in this particular area, the meat packing processing plants had a huge amount of authority and power within the city and county of denver, and the industry was incredibly strong. they oftentimes not only owned the meat processing plants, but they also owned some of the yards, they owned the cattle, they owned the ranches. so this is one of the last remaining buildings that's associated with the meat processing plant, which was so intrinsic to the development of the city and county of denver. it is also significant under history for having a direct and substantial association with a person or groups of persons who had influence on society. so this particular building is associated with a couple of different groups. the first is the gephardt family. the gephardt family is the is the family that started the armor company. henry and then his son, charles, were the two that were the instrumental members of the gephardt family within the armor packing industry. henry founded the colorado packing and provision company, and then he was really instrumental in the denver union stockyards. he was an executive of the western stock show, and he present he helped produce the national western stock show. it was then passed onto his son, charles gephardt, and he was there when the armor company ended up purchasing what had initially been the colorado packing and provision company. and then they allowed the gephardt family to continue to run the business. and this is the building that was constructed for the administration of it. but since so much else has been lost, this is the one of the buildings that's associated with the gephardt family. this property is also associated with the the neighborhood that surrounds it, that the meatpacking and the meat processing was one of the stable positions that could be gained by the immigrants who came over. and so it is primarily blue collar employment for the immigrants who are primarily russian, slavic and eastern european, east from eastern european countries at this time. and so the meat processing plants provided stable employment for the populations that lived in the neighborhood. and so this is a representative of the ability to maintain and live in that community was through the meat processing plant and so it provided stable employment for the population. the property is also significant for its architecture, for embodying distinguishing characteristics of an architectural style or type. and this is a neoclassical style. it was constructed in 1917, and it can be seen through its cobbled cornice at the top. from the simple geometric designs on the brick walls. the very regular and symmetrical form. and in the fenestration pattern. and then the one story porch. oftentimes on a neoclassical, you'll actually see a two story porch. in this case, it's a slightly stripped down version with the one story classical columns. and then finally, it's significant for its geography for promoting an understanding and appreciation of the urban environment by means of a distinctive physical characteristic or rarity. in this particular instance, it's rare for being the sole remaining building that's related to the meatpacking industry of the swift and armor plants that had been demolished. and so as you look at the 1961 sanborn map, you can see the arrow that points to the the one admin building. all of those other buildings that are on there were associated with the with the with a swift in armor plate or with this with the armor plants. and they have since been demolished. and so this is the a rarity for being one of the only remaining meatpacking industry plants in the city. and finally, it's a significant under geography for making a special contribution to denver's distinctive characteristic. this isn't something that is used or is there aren't many properties that are designated under this. it's the designation that is what makes denver. denver and the national western stock show and the denver union stockyards are intrinsic to the character of denver, and they have defined denver as a major livestock hub since the early 20th century. and so this building is strongly associated with the intrinsic nature of denver's history. after meeting all of the criteria, a property still has to maintain its historic and physical integrity, which is basically does the property look what it used to look ? and as you can see from these pictures, it is remarkably intact. underneath the boarded out, underneath the boards, there are the windows that still remain. so overall, there are minimal changes that have occurred to this building on the right hand side, which is actually a little hard to see. it's behind some bushes on one of the windows have been turned into doors. but overall, other than the painting of the brick and the boarding up of windows, but the windows there are still underneath. it has a remarkably good integrity and staff, as well as the landmark preservation commission, found that it maintained its historic and physical integrity . and finally, the landmark preservation commission considered how the structure relates to historic context or themes. and they looked at how it is associated with the development of the meatpacking industry in denver, the growth of ranching in the livestock industry, and then with the national western stock show and found that it was related to multiple historic contexts in denver's history. when the commission reviewed that, they found that history under one a and one c, architecture under two a, geography three b and three c, that it maintained its historic and physical integrity. and they found that it was eligible to be a denver landmark. they voted unanimously, eight zero. and i'm happy to answer any questions you may have. thank you very much. we have three individuals lined up to speak this evening. so if you've signed up to speak on this item, ask you to come up to the front bench. when i call your name, step up to the podium and your time will begin to elapse. first up, we have eric anderson. good evening, councilmembers. my name is eric anderson. i'm the design manager for the mayor's office of the national restaurant center. this is a very important building to our new campus. it sits right. in the middle of all the things that. are going to happen. and we're really looking forward to seeing a new use here. so i'm here to answer any questions regarding the site or the building itself. thank you. thank you very much. thank you very much. next up, john olsen. thank you very much, council members. my name is john olsen. i'm the deputy director of historic denver. i'm here to absolutely support this as a designation up at the national western center, part of the national western stock trail. i'm here as a part of of being with this historic denver, which, of course, you're very used to seeing me from that standpoint. but i'm also here from the point of view of the national western citizen advisory committee. and in our conversations with the community members and with history colorado and with the national western center, this was one of those buildings that was identified very early on as being very important to the site. we're talking about a very exciting development that's going to happen to the national western center and a national western stock show area . but we want this to be part of denver. and this is something that is a part of denver. it's associated with denver. the community members have associated with this with the meatpacking industry because they have a large history with the meatpacking industry. a lot of the descendants still live in the globeville, elyria, swansea area. so from that standpoint, this is going to be very exciting. this is going to be a piece that's going to integrate, i think, very well with the development that's going to be going there. and it's really going to show what we're all about here in denver that we're forward thinking when it comes to agriculture and urban ideas. but we understand and identify the importance of our past and the reasons why this location was so important to denver. so thank you very much. thank you. and next up, jesse pearce. jesse paris black starts a movement for self-defense. deborah thomas out loud and positive commitment for social change. and i'm also now large candidate for 2019. we are actually in favor of this. abbie reminds me of a time when denver was such a humble place to live and it was a cow town and you could travel through the town in 10 minutes. now try to. it takes over an hour. so, yeah, we're definitely in favor of this. it should have been done already, but yes, we're in favor of this. thank you. thank you. that concludes our speakers. are there any questions from members of council? councilman flynn. thank you, eric. could you tell us from the standpoint of the national western center project, how does the landmark designation fit into the plan overall? if you go back to the master plan that was approved 2015, there were four structures. that were historically significant. that we thought at some point needed to be kind of kept. and talked about and make sure that we we. were clear about what they wanted to be before we did anything else. and this was one of them. very important. of course, the 1909 stadium arena building was the first one. and then and then we also had the livestock exchange building. which will be moving forward hopefully soon. and then, of course, the denver coliseum, which is to be determined at a later date. tbd. yes, thank you. i just want to make sure that folks understood how this fit into the overall plan. we've been looking at this for a long time. yes. okay. thank you. that's all, mr. president. thank you. councilman flynn. councilman brooks. no, it's okay. you're good. councilwoman ortega. i'm not sure who can answer this. i'm just trying to clarify. is this the the residence that tom anthony lived in? it is. okay. thank you. thank you. councilwoman ortega, seeing no other question, the public hearing for council 1539 is closed. comments by members of council councilman brooks. yeah, thank you, mr. president. it's it's nice to have a landmark designation where everyone is in support of designating this. so i think all parties and i think the national lessons center for for taking the lead on this and making this easy over this 250 acre redevelopment. so we've been talking about this for a long time, and it's always been a priority and a value from the residents in the area to make sure that these properties are historically designated and that they capture the fabric of the context in the neighborhood. and so i'm excited to support this and i hope my colleagues will do the same. thank you. thank you very much. councilman brooks. seeing no other comments, madam secretary, roll call on council bill 1339. yeah.

the greatest american president was abraham lincoln. and tolstoy reflected on this himself, actually, saying that when he was in the caucuses, he asked these peasants in the caucuses who was the greatest man in the world that they had heard of, and they said abraham lincoln. and why? well, because he gave voice to people who had no voice before. he turned politics into an art. this is what tolstoy recounted, the peasants in the caucuses telling him. lincoln made politics more than about power. he made it an art. he made it a source of liberation. and those living even far from the united states could see that model, that inspiration from lincoln. he was a man who had two years of education, yet he mastered the english language, and he used the language to help people imagine a different kind of world. you see, leaders and presidents are at their best when they're doing more than just manipulating institutions and power, when they're helping the people imagine a better world. and he did that as no other president has. and you say he gave voice to those who are voiceless. who are you talking to about in general? is this about african-americans, or is this about just the populace in general? certainly part of it is about slaves, african-americans, and many immigrants, immigrants from all parts of europe and other areas that have come to the united states. but part of it was just for ordinary american citizens. the republican party, for which lincoln was the first president, was a party created to give voice to poor white men, as well as slaves and others. and lincoln was a poor white man himself. grew up without slaves and without land, which meant you had almost nothing. what do you think about the trajectory of that man with only two years of education? is there something to be said about how does one come from nothing and nurture the ideals that kind of make this country great into something where you can actually be a leader of this nation to espouse those ideas, to give voice to the voiceless? yes, i think you actually hit the nail on the head. i think what he represented was the opportunity, and that was the word that mattered for him, opportunity that came from the ability to raise yourself up, to work hard, and to be compensated for your hard work. and this is at the core of the republican party of the 19th century, which is the core of capitalism. it's not about getting rich. it's about getting compensated for your work. it's about being incentivized to do better work. and lincoln was constantly striving. one of his closest associates, herndon, said, he was the little engine of ambition that couldn't stop. he just kept going, taught himself to read, taught himself to be a lawyer. he went through many failed businesses before he even reached that point. many failed love affairs, but he kept trying. he kept working, and what american society offered him and what he wanted american society to offer everyone else was the opportunity to keep trying to fail and then get up and try again. what do you think was the nature of that ambition? was there a hunger for power? i think lincoln had a hunger for success. i think he had a hunger to get out of the poor station he was in. he had a hunger to be someone who had control over his life. freedom for him did not mean the right to do anything you want to do, but it meant the right to be secure from being dependent upon someone else. so independence. he writes in his letters when he's very young that he hated being dependent on his father. he grew up without a mother. his father was a struggling farmer, and he would write in his letters that his father treated him a slave on the farm. some think his hatred of slavery came from that experience. he didn't ever want to have to work for someone again. he wanted to be free and independent, and he wanted again, every american, this is the kind of jeffersonian dream, to be the owner of themselves and the owner of their future. you know, that's a really nice definition of freedom. we often think kind of this very abstract notion of being able to do anything you want, but really it's ultimately breaking yourself free from the constraints, the very tight dependence on whether it's the institutions or on your family or the expectations or the community or whatever, being able to be, to realize yourself within the constraints of your own abilities. it's still not true freedom. this true freedom is probably sort of, almost designing a video game character, something that. i agree, i think that's exactly right. i think freedom is not that i can have any outcome i want. i can't control outcomes. the most powerful, freest person in the world cannot control outcomes, but it means that at least i get to make choices. someone else doesn't make those choices for me. is there something to be said about lincoln and on the political game front of it, which is he's accomplished some of them? i don't know, but it seems there were some tricky politics going on. we tend to not think of it in those terms because of the dark aspects of slavery. we tend to think about it in sort of ethical and human terms, but in their time, it was probably as much a game of politics, not just these broad questions of human nature. it was a game. so is there something to be said about being a skillful player in the game of politics that you take from lincoln? absolutely, and lincoln never read karl von clausewitz, the great 19th century german thinker on strategy and politics, but he embodied the same wisdom, which is that everything is politics. if you want to get anything done, and this includes even relationships, there's a politics to it. what does that mean? it means that you have to persuade, coerce, encourage people to do things they wouldn't otherwise do. and lincoln was a master at that. he was a master at that for two reasons. he had learned through his hard life to read people, to anticipate them, to spend a lot of time listening. one thing i often tell people is the best leaders are the listeners, not the talkers. and then second, lincoln was very thoughtful and planned every move out. he was thinking three or four moves, maybe five moves down the chessboard, while others were move number one or two. that's fascinating to think about him just listening, just studying. that's, they look at great fighters in this way. like the first few rounds of boxing and mixed martial arts, you're studying the movement of your opponent in order to sort of define the holes. that's really interesting for him to think about it. is there, in terms of relationships, where do you think as president or as a politician is the most impact to be had? i've been reading a lot about hitler recently, and one of the things that i'm more and more starting to wonder, what the hell did he do alone in a room, one-on-one with people? because it seems that's where he was exceptionally effective. when i think about certain leaders, i'm not sure stalin was this way. i apologize, been very obsessed with this period of human history. it just seems certain leaders are extremely effective one-on-one. a lot of people think of hitler in lincoln as a speech maker, as a great charismatic speech maker. but it seems to me that some of these guys were really effective inside a room. what do you think? what's more important, your effectiveness to make a hell of a good speech, sort of being in a room with many people, or is it all boiled down to one-on-one? well, i think in a sense it's both. one needs to do both, and most politicians, most leaders are better at one or the other. it's the rare leader who can do both. i will say that if you are going to be a figure who's a president or the leader of a complex organization, not a startup, but a complex organization where you have many different constituencies and many different interests, you have to do the one-on-one really well. because a lot of what's going to happen is you're going to be meeting with people who represent different groups, right? the leader of the labor unions, the leader of your investing board, et cetera, and you have to be able to persuade them. and it's the intangibles that often matter most. lincoln's skill, and it's the same that fdr had, is the ability to tell a story. i think hitler was a little different, but what i've read of stalin is he was a storyteller too. one-on-one storyteller? yeah, that's my understanding is that he, and what lincoln did, i don't want to compare lincoln to stalin, but lincoln did, is he was not confrontational. he was happy to have an argument if an argument were to be had, but actually what he would try to do is move you through telling a story that got you to think about your position in a different way, to basically disarm you. and franklin roosevelt did the same thing. ronald reagan did the same thing. storytelling is a very important skill. it's almost heartbreaking that we don't get to have, or maybe you can correct me if i'm wrong on this, but it feels we don't have a lot of information how all of these folks were in private, one-on-one conversations. even if we get stories about it, it's , again, sorry to bring up hitler, but people have talked about his pearson gaze when they're one-on-one. there's a feeling he's just looking through you. i wonder, it makes me wonder, it was lincoln, somebody who was a little bit more passive, who's more, the ego doesn't shine. it's not an overwhelming thing. or is it more , again, don't wanna bring up controversial figures, but donald trump, where it's more menacing, right? there's a more physically menacing thing where it's almost a bullying kind of dynamic. so i wonder, i wish we knew. i wish, because from a psychological perspective, i wonder if there's a thread that connects most great leaders. great question. so i think the best writer on this is max weber, right? and he talks about the power of charisma, that the term charisma comes from weber, right? and weber's use of it actually to talk about profits. and i think he has a point, right? leaders who are effective in the way you describe are leaders who feel prophetic, or weber says they have a kind of magic about them. and i think that can come from different sources. i think that can come from the way someone carries themselves. it can come from the way they use words. so maybe there are different kinds of magic that someone develops. but i think there are two things that seem to be absolutely necessary. first is you have to be someone who sizes up the person on the other side of the table. you cannot be the person who just comes in and reads your brief. and then second, i think it's interactive. and there is a quickness of thought. so you brought up donald trump. i don't think donald trump is a deep thinker at all, but he's quick. and i think that quickness is part of it. it's different from delivering a lecture where it's the depth of your thought. can you for 45 minutes analyze something? many people can't do that, but they still might be very effective if they're able to quickly react, size up the person on the other side of the table, and react in a way that moves that person in the way they wanna move them. yeah, and there's also just a couple to the quickness as a kind of instinct about human nature. yes. sort of asking the question, what does this person worry about? what are the biggest problems? somebody, what is this, stephen schwartzman, i think, said to me, this businessman, i think he said, what i've always tried to do is try to figure out, ask enough questions to figure out what is the biggest problem in this person's life. try to get a sense of what is the biggest problem in their life, because that's actually what they care about most. and most people don't care enough to find out. and so he kind of wants to sneak up on that and find that and then use that to then build closeness in order to then, probably he doesn't put in those words, but to manipulate the person into whatever, to do whatever the heck they want. and i think part of it is that, and part of the effect that donald trump has is how quick he's able to figure that out. you've written a book about how the role and power of the presidency has changed. so how has it changed since lincoln's time, the evolution of the presidency as a concept, which seems a fascinating lens through which to look at american history. as a president, we seem to only be talking about the presidents, maybe a general here and there, but it's mostly the story of america is often told through presidents. that's right, that's right. and one of the points i've tried to make in my writing about this and various other activities is we use this word president as if it's something timeless, but the office has changed incredibly. it just, from lincoln's time to the present, which is 150 years, he wouldn't recognize the office today. and george washington would not have recognized it in lincoln, just as i think a ceo today would be unrecognizable to a rockefeller or a carnegie of 150 years ago. so what are some of the ways in which the office has changed? i'll just point to three, there are a lot. one, presidents now can communicate with the public directly. i mean, we've reached the point now where a president can have direct, almost one-on-one communication. president can use twitter if he so chooses to circumvent all media. that was unthinkable. lincoln, in order to get his message across, often wrote letters to newspapers and waited for the newspaper for horace greeley in the new york tribune to publish his letter. that's how he communicated with the public. there weren't even many speaking opportunities. so that's a big change, right? we feel the president in our life much more. that's why we talk about him much more. that also creates more of a burden. this is the second point. presidents are under a microscope. presidents are under a microscope. you have to be very careful what you do and what you say, and you're judged by a lot of the elements of your behavior that are not policy relevant. in fact, the things we judge most and make most of our decisions on about individuals are often that. and then third, the power the president has. it's inhuman, actually. and this is one of my critiques of how the office has changed. this one person has power on a scale that's, i think, dangerous in a democracy and certainly something the founders 220 years ago would have had trouble conceiving. presidents now have the ability to deliver force across the world to literally assassinate people with a remarkable accuracy. and that's an enormous power that presidents have. to your sense, this is not to get conspiratorial, but do you think a president currently has the power to initiate the assassination of somebody, of a political enemy or a terrorist leader or that kind of thing, to frame that person in a way where assassination is something that he alone or she alone could decide to do? i think it happens all the time, and it's not to be conspiratorial. this is how we've fought terrorism, by targeting individuals. now you might say these were not elected leaders of state, but these were individuals with a large following. i mean, the killing of osama bin laden was an assassination operation. and we've taken out very successfully many leaders of terrorist organizations, and we do it every day. you're saying that back in lincoln's time or george washington's time, there was more of a balance of power, a president could not initiate this kind of assassination? correct, i think presidents did not have the same kind of military or economic power. we could talk about how a president can influence a market by saying something about where money is gonna go or singling out a company or critiquing a company in one way or another. they didn't have that kind of power. now, much of the power that a lincoln or a washington had was the power to mobilize people to then make their own decisions. at the start of the civil war, lincoln doesn't even have the power to bring people into the army. he has to go to the governors and ask the governors to provide soldiers. so the governor of wisconsin, the governor of massachusetts, could you imagine that today? yeah, so they use speeches and words to mobilize versus direct action in closed door environments, initiating wars, for example. correct. it's difficult to think about, if we look at barack obama, for example, if you're listening to this and you're on the left or the right, please do not make this political. in fact, if you're a political person and you're getting angry at the mention of the word obama or donald trump, please turn off this podcast and unsubscribe. we're not gonna get very far. i hope we maintain a political discussion about even the modern presidents that view through the lens of history. i think there's a lot to be learned about the office and about human nature. some people criticize barack obama for sort of expanding the military industrial complex, engaging in more and more wars, as opposed to sort of the initial rhetoric was such that we would pull back from sort of be more skeptical in our decisions to wage wars. so from the lens of the power of the presidency, as the modern presidency, the fact that we continued the war in afghanistan at different engagements in military conflicts, do you think barack obama could have stopped that? do you put the responsibility on that expansion on him because of the implied power that the presidency has? or is this power just sits there and if the president chooses to take it, they do, and if they don't, they don't. almost you don't want to take on the responsibility because of the burden of that responsibility. so a lot of my research is about this exact question, not just with obama. and my conclusion, and i think the research is pretty clear on this, is that structure has a lot more effect on us than we to admit, which is to say that the circumstances, the institutions around us drive our behavior more than we to think. so barack obama, i'm quite certain, came into the office of the presidency committed to actually reducing the use of military force overseas and reducing presidential war-making power. as a trained lawyer, he had a moral position on this, actually, and he tried, and he did withdraw american forces from iraq and was of course criticized by many people for doing that. but at the same time, he had some real problems in the world to deal with, terrorism being one of them. and the tools he has are very much biased towards the use of military force. it's much harder as president to go and get vladimir putin and xi jinping to agree with you. it's much easier to send these wonderful toys we have and these incredible soldiers we have over there. and when you have congress, which is always against you, it's also easier to use the military because you send them there. and even if members of congress from your own party or the other are angry at you, they'll still fund the soldiers. no member of congress wants to vote to starve our soldiers overseas. so they'll stop your budget. they'll even threaten not to pay the debt, but they'll still fund your soldiers. and so you are pushed by the circumstances you're in to do this and it's very hard to resist. so that's, i think the criticism of obama, the fair one would be that he didn't resist the pressures that were there, but he did not make those pressures. so is there something about putting the responsibility on the president to form the structure around him locally such that he can make the policy that matches the rhetoric? so what i'm talking to is hiring. so basically just everybody you work with, you have power as a president to fire and hire or to basically schedule meetings in such a way that can control your decision-making. so i imagine it's very difficult to get out of afghanistan or iraq when most of your scheduled meetings are with generals or something that. but if you reorganize the schedule and you reorganize who you have late night talks with, you potentially have a huge ripple effect on the policy. i think that's right. i think who has access to the president is absolutely crucial. and presidents have to be more strategic about that. they tend to be reacting to crises because every day has a crisis. and if you're reacting to a crisis, you're not controlling access because the crisis is driving you. so that's one element of it. but i also think, and this is the moment we're in right now, presidents have to invest in reforming the system, the system of decision-making. should we have a national security council that looks the way it does? should our military be structured the way it is? the founding fathers wanted a military that was divided. they did not want a unified department of defense. that was only created after world war ii. should we have as large a military as we have? should we be in as many places? there are some fundamental structural reforms we have to undertake. and part of that is who you appoint, but part of that is also how you change the institutions. the genius of the american system is that it's a dynamic system. it can be adjusted. it has been adjusted over time. that's the heroic story. the frustrating story is it often takes us a long time to make those adjustments until we go into such bad circumstances that we have no choice. so in the battle of power of the office of the president versus the united states military, the department of defense, do you have a sense that the president has more power ultimately? so to decrease the size of the department of defense, to withdraw from any wars or increase the amount of wars, is the president, you're kind of implying the president has a lot of power here in this scale. yes, the president has a lot of power and we are fortunate. and it was just proven in the last few years that our military uniquely among many countries with large militaries is very deferential to the president and very restricted in its ability to challenge the president. so that's a strength of our system. but the way you reform the military is not with individual decisions. it's by having a strategic plan that re-examines what role it plays. so it's not just about whether we're in afghanistan or not. the question we have to ask is when we look at our toolbox of what we can do in our foreign policy, are there other tools we should build up and therefore some tools in the military we should reduce? that's the broader strategic question. let me ask you the most absurd question of all that you did not sign up for, but it's especially, i've been hanging out with a guy named joe rogan recently. sure. so it's very important for me and him to figure this out. if a president, because you said, you implied the president is very powerful. if a president shows up and the us government is in fact in possession of aliens, alien spacecraft, do you think the president will be told? a more responsible adult historian question version of that is there some things that the machine of government keeps secret from the president? or is the president ultimately at the very center? so if you map out the set of information and power, you have cia, you have all these organizations that that do the machinery of government, not just the passing of bills, but gaining information, homeland security, actually engaging in wars, you know, all those kinds of things. how central is the president? would the president know some of the shady things that are going on? aliens or some kind of cybersecurity stuff against russia and china, all those kinds of things. is the president really made aware? and if so, how nervous does that make you? so presidents leaders of any complex organizations don't know everything that goes on. they have to ask the right questions. this is machiavelli. most important thing a leader has to do is ask the right questions. you don't have to know the answers. that's why you hire smart people, but you have to ask the right questions. so if the president asks the us government, those who are responsible for the aliens or responsible for the cyber warfare against russia, they will answer honestly, they will have to, but they will not volunteer that information in all cases. so the best way a president can operate is to have people around him or her who are not the traditional policy makers. this is where i think academic experts are important, suggesting questions to ask to therefore try to get the information. makes me nervous because i think human nature is such that the academics, the experts, everybody is almost afraid to ask the questions for which the answers might be burdensome. yes, that's right. and you can get into a lot of trouble not asking, it's the old elephant in the room. correct, correct. this is exactly right and too often mediocre leaders and those who try to protect them try to shield themselves. they don't want to know certain things. so this is part of what happened with the use of torture by the united states, which is a war crime during the war on terror. president bush at times intentionally did not ask and people around him prevented him from asking or discouraged him from asking questions he should have asked to know about what was going on. and that's how we ended up where we did. you could say the same thing about reagan and iran-contra. i wonder what it takes to be the kind of leader that steps in and asks some difficult questions. so aliens is one, ufo spacecraft, right? another one, yeah, torture is another one. the cia, how much information is being collected about americans? i can see as a president being very uncomfortable asking that question. because if the answer is a lot of information is being collected by americans, then you have to be the guy who lives with that information. for the rest of your life, you have to walk around. you're probably not going to reform that system. it's very difficult. you probably have to be very picky about which things you reform. you don't have much time. it takes a lot of sort of effort to restructure things. but you nevertheless would have to be basically lying to yourself, to others around you about the unethical things. depends of course what the ethical system is. i wonder what it takes to ask those hard questions. i wonder if how few of us can be great leaders that. and i wonder if our political system, the electoral system, such that makes it likely that such leaders will come to power. it's hard and you can't ask all the right questions and there is a legal hazard if you know things at certain times. but i think you can, back to your point on hiring, you can hire people who will do that in their domains. and then you have to trust that when they think it's something that's a question you need to ask, they'll pass that on to you. this is why it's not a good idea to have loyalists, because loyalists will shield you from things. it's a good idea to have people of integrity who you can rely on and who you think will ask those right questions. and then pass that down through their organization. what's inspiring to you? what's insightful to you about several of the presidencies throughout the recent decades? is there somebody that stands out to you that's interesting and sort of in your study of how the office has changed? well, bill clinton is one of the most fascinating figures. why can't i apologize? bill clinton just puts a smile on my face every time somebody mentions him at this point. i don't know why. it's charisma, i suppose. well, and he's a unique individual, but he fascinates me because he's a figure of such enormous talent and enormous appetite and such little self-control and such extremes. and i think it's not just that he tells us something about the presidency, he tells us something about our society, american society. this is not new to our time. it's filled with enormous reservoirs of talent and creativity, and those have a bright and a dark side. and you see both with bill clinton. in some ways, he's the mirror of the best and worst of our society. and maybe that's really what presidents are in the end. they're mirrors of our world that we get the government we deserve, we get the leaders we deserve. i wish we embraced that a little bit more. a lot of people criticize donald trump for certain human qualities that he has. a lot of people criticize bill clinton for certain human qualities. i wish we kind of embraced the chaos of that. you know, because he does, you're right, in some sense represent, i mean, he doesn't represent the greatest ideal of america, but the flawed aspect of human nature is what he represents, and that's the beautiful thing about america, the diversity of this land with the mix of it, the corruption within capitalism, the beauty of capitalism, the innovation, all those kinds of things, the people that start from nothing and create everything the elon musk's of the world and the bill gates and so on, but also the people, bernie madoffs, and all as the me too movement has showed, the multitude of creeps that apparently permeate the entirety of our system. so i don't know, there is something, there is some sense in which we put our president on a pedestal, which actually creates a fake human being. the standard we hold them to is forcing the fake politicians to come to power versus the authentic one, which is in some sense the promise of donald trump is , it's a definitive statement of authenticity. it's , this the opposite of the fake politician, it's whatever else you wanna say about him, is there's the chaos that's unlike anything else that came before. one thing, and this is a particular maybe preference and quirk of mine, but i really admire, maybe i'm romanticizing the past again, but i romanticize the presidents that were students of history. they were almost king philosophers, great, that made speeches that reverberated through decades after. we kind of, using the words of those presidents, whether written by them or not, we tell the story of america. and i don't know, even obama has been an exceptionally good, as far as i know, i apologize if i'm incorrect on this, but from everything i've seen, he was a very deep scholar of history. and i really admire that. is that through the history of the office of the president, through the history of the office of the presidency, is that just your own preference or is that supposed to come with a job? are you supposed to be a student of history? i think, i mean, i'm obviously biased as a historian, but i do think it comes with a job. every president i've studied had a serious interest in history. now, how they pursued that interest would vary. obama was more bookish, more academic. so was george w. bush in strange ways. george h.w. bush was less so, but george h.w. bush loved to talk to people. so he would talk to historians, right? ronald reagan loved movies and movies were an insight into history for him. he likes to watch movies about another time. it wasn't always the best of history, but he was interested in what is a fundamental historical question. how has our society developed? how has it grown and changed over time? and how has that change affected who we are today? that's the historical question. it's really interesting to me. i do a lot of work with business leaders and others too. you reach a certain point in any career and you become a historian because you realize that the formulas and the technical knowledge that you've gained got you to where you are. but now your decisions are about human nature. your decisions are about social change and they can't be answered technically. they can only be answered by studying human beings. and what is history? it's studying the laboratory of human behavior. to sort of play devil's advocate, i kind of, especially in the engineering scientific domains, i often see history holding us back. sort of the way things were done in the past are not necessarily going to hold the key to what will progress us into the future. of course, with history in studying human nature, it does seem humans are just the same. it's just the same problems over and over. so in that sense, it feels history has all the lessons, whether we're talking about wars, whether we're talking about corruption, whether we're talking about economics. i think there's a difference between history and antiquarianism. so antiquarianism, which some people call history, is the desire to go back to the past or stay stuck in the past. or antiquarianism is the desire to have the desk that abraham lincoln sat at. wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk? i'd love to have that desk. if i had a few extra million dollars, i'd acquire it, right? so in a way, that's antiquarianism. that's trying to capture and hold on, hold on to the past. the past is a talisman for antiquarians. what history is, is the study of change over time. that's the real definition of historical study and historical thinking. and so what we're studying is change. and so a historian should never say, we have to do things the way we've done them in the past. the historian should say, we can't do them the way we did them in the past. we can't step in the same river twice. every podcast of yours is different from the last one. you plan it out and then it goes in its own direction. and what are we studying then in history? we're studying the patterns of change and we're recognizing we're part of a pattern. so what i would say to the historian who's trying to hold the engineer back, i'd say, no, don't tell that engineer not to do this. tell them to understand how this fits into the relationship with other engineering products and other activities from the past that still affect us today. for example, any product you produce is gonna be used by human beings who have prejudices. it's gonna go into an unequal society. don't assume it's gonna go into an equal society. don't assume that when you create a social media site, that people are going to use it fairly and put only truthful things on it. we shouldn't be surprised. that's where human nature comes in. but it's not trying to hold onto the past. it's trying to use the knowledge from the past to better inform the changes today. i have to ask you about george washington. maybe you have some insights. it seems he's such a fascinating figure in the context of the study of power because i kind of intuitively have come to internalize the belief that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. yes. and sort of basically in thinking that we cannot trust any one individual. i can't trust myself with power. nobody can trust anybody with power. we have to create institutions and structures that prevent us from ever being able to amass absolute power. and yet here's a guy, george washington, who seems to, you can correct me if i'm wrong, but he seems to give away relinquished power. it feels george washington did it , almost the purest of ways, which is believes in this country, but he just believes he's not the person to carry it forward. what do you make of that? what kind of human does it take to give away that power? is there some hopeful message we can carry through to the future to elect leaders that or to find friends to hang out with who are that? like, what is that? how do you explain that? so it's actually the most important thing about george washington. it's the right thing to bring up. what the historian gary wills wrote years ago, i'm gonna quote him, was that washington recognized that sometimes you get more power by giving it up than by trying to hold on to every last piece of it. washington gives up power at the end of the revolution. he's successfully carried through the revolutionary war aims. he's commander of the revolutionary forces and he gives up his command. and then of course he's president. and after two terms, he gives up his command. what is he doing? he's an ambitious person, but he's recognizing that the most important currency he has for power is his respected status as a disinterested statesman. that's really what his power is. and how does he further that power? by showing that he doesn't crave power. so he was self-aware. very self-aware of this and very sophisticated in understanding this. and i think there are many other leaders who recognize that. you can look to in some ways the story of many of our presidents who even before there is a two term limit in the constitution leave after two terms. they do that because they recognize that their power is the power of being a statesman, not of being a president. i still wonder what kind of man it takes, what kind of human being it takes to do that. because i've been studying vladimir putin quite a bit. right. and he's still, i believe he still has popular support that that's not fully manipulated. because i know a lot of people in russia and actually almost the entirety of my family in russia are big supporters of putin. and everybody i talk to, sort of that's not just on social media. right. like the people that live in russia seem to support him. it feels this will be in a george washington way. now will be the time that would putin, just yeltsin could relinquish power. and thereby in the eyes of russians, become in the long arc of history, be viewed as a great leader. you look at the economic growth of russia. you look at the rescue from the collapse of the soviet union and russia finding its footing and then relinquishing power in a way that, perhaps if russia succeeds forms a truly democratic state. this would be how putin can become one of the great leaders in russian history, at least in the context of the 21st century. i think there are two reasons why this is really hard for putin and for others. one is the trappings of power are very seductive, as you said before, they're corrupting. this is a real problem, right? if it's in the business context, you don't wanna give up that private jet. if it's in putin's context, it's billions of dollars every year that he's able to take for himself or give to his friends. it's not that he'll be poor if he leaves, he'll still be rich. and he has billions of dollars stored away, but he won't be able to get the new billions. and so that's part of the trappings of power are a big deal. and then second, in putin's case in particular, he has to be worried about what happens next. will he be tried? will someone try to come and arrest him? will someone try to come and assassinate him? washington recognized that leaving early limited the corruption and limited the enemies that you made. and so it was a strategic choice. putin is at this point, bring in power too long. and this comes back to your core insight. it's a cliche, but it's true. power corrupts. no one should have power for too long. this was one of the best insights the founders of the united states had. that power was to be held for a short time as a fiduciary responsibility, not as something you owned, right? this is the problem with monarchy, with aristocracy that you own power, right? we don't own power. we are in holding it in trust. yeah, there's some probably very specific psychological study of how many years it takes for you to forget that you can't own power. that's right. that could be a much more rigorous discussion about the length of terms that are appropriate, but really there's an amount stalin had power for 30 years, putin is pushing that many years already. there's a certain point where you forget the person you were before you took the power. that's right. you forget to be humble in the face of this responsibility and then there's no going back. that's right. and that's how dictators are born. that's how the evil authoritarians become evil, or let's not use the word evil, but counterproductive, destructive to the ideal that they initially probably came to office with. that's right. that's right. one of the core historical insights is people should move jobs. and this applies for ceos probably. absolutely. absolutely, they can go become ceo somewhere else, but don't stay ceo one place too long. it's a problem with startups, right? the founder, you can have a brilliant founder and that founder doesn't wanna let go. yeah. right, it's the same issue. at the same time, i mean, this is where elon musk and a few others larry page and sergey brin that stayed for quite a long time and they actually were the beacon. they on their shoulders carried the dream of the company where everybody else doubted. but that seems to be the exception versus the rule. well, and even sergey, for example, right, has stepped back. he plays less of a day-to-day role and is not running google in the way he did. but the interesting thing is he stepped back in a quite tragic way from what i've seen, which is i think google's mission, an initial mission of making the world's information accessible to everybody is one of the most beautiful missions of any company in the history of the world. i think it's what google has done with a search engine and other efforts that are similar, scanning a lot of books. sure, it's great. it's just incredible. it's similar to wikipedia. but what he said was that it's not the same company anymore. and i know maybe i'm reading too much into it because it's more maybe practically saying just the size of the company is much larger, the kind of leadership that's required. but at the same time, they changed the motto from, don't be evil to it's becoming corporatized and all those kinds of things. and it's sad. there also are cycles, right? history is about cycles, right? there are cycles to life. there are cycles to organizations. it's sad. i mean, it's sad steve jobs leaving apple by passing away, sad. you know, what the future of spacex and tesla looks without elon musk is quite sad. it's very possible that those companies become something very different. they become something much more, you know, corporate and stale. yeah, so maybe most of the progress has made their cycles. maybe new elon musk comes along, all those kinds of things. but it does seem that the american system of government has built into it the cycling. yes. that makes it effective and it makes it last very long. it lasts a very long time, right? it continues to excel and lead the world. sure, sure. and let's hope it continues to. no, i mean, we're into, you know, a third century and democracies on this scale rarely last that long. so that's a point of pride, but it also means we need to be attentive to keep our house in order because it's not inevitable that this experiment continues. now it's important to meditate on that actually. you've mentioned that fdr, franklin d. roosevelt is one of the great leaders in american history. why is that? franklin roosevelt had the power of empathy. no leader that i've ever studied or been around or spent any time reading about was able to connect with people who were so different from himself as franklin roosevelt. he came from the most elite family. he never had to work for a paycheck in his life. when he was president, he was still collecting an allowance from his mom. you couldn't be more elite than franklin roosevelt, but he authentically connected. this was not, you know, propaganda. he was able to feel the pain and understand the lives of some of the most destitute americans in other parts of the country. it's interesting. so through one of the hardest economic periods of american history, he was able to feel the pain. he was able to, the number of immigrants i read oral histories from or who have written themselves, saul bellow is one example, the great novelist who talked about how as immigrants to the us, saul bellow was a russian jewish immigrant. he said, growing up in chicago, politicians were all trying to steal from us. i didn't think any of them cared until i heard fdr and i knew he spoke to me. and i think part of it was fdr really tried to understand people. that's the first thing, he was humble enough to try to do that. but second, he had a talent for that and it's hard to know exactly what it was, but he had a talent for putting himself, imagining himself in someone else's shoes. what stands out to you as important? i mean, so he went through the great depression. so the new deal, which some people criticize, some people see, i mean, it's funny to look at some of these policies and their long ripple effects. but at the time, it's some of the most innovative policies in the history of america. you could say they're ultimately not good for america, but they're nevertheless hold within them very rich and important lessons. but the new deal and obviously world war ii, that entire process, is there something that stands out to you as a particularly great moment that made fdr? yes, i think what fdr does from his first 100 days in office forward, and this begins with his fireside chats, is he helps americans to see that they're all in it together. and that's by creating hope and creating a sense of common suffering and common mission. it's not offering simple solutions. one of the lessons from fdr is, if you wanna bring people together, don't offer a simple solution. because as soon as i offer a simple solution, i have people for it and against it. don't do that. explain the problem, frame the problem, and then give people a mission. so roosevelt's first radio address in march of 1933, the banking system is collapsing. and we can't imagine it, right? banks were closing and you couldn't get your money out. your life savings would be lost, right? we can't imagine that happening in our world today. he comes on the radio, he takes five minutes to explain how banking works. most people didn't understand how banking worked, right? they don't actually hold your money in a vault. they lend it out to someone else. and then he explains why if you go and take your money out of the bank and put it in your mattress, you're making it worse for yourself. he explains this. and then he says, i don't have a solution, but here's what i wanna do. i'm gonna send in government officers to examine the banks and show you the books on the banks. and i want you to help me by going and putting your money back in the banks. we're all gonna do this together. no simple solution, no ideological statement, but a sense of common mission. let's go out and do this together. when you read, as i have, so many of these oral histories and memoirs for people who lived through that period, many of them disagreed with some of his policies. many of them thought he was too close to jews and they didn't the fact he had a woman in his cabinet and all that, but they felt he cared. and they felt they were part of some common mission. and when they talk about their experience fighting in world war ii, whether in europe or asia, it was that that prepared them. they knew what it meant to be an american when they were over there. so that to me is a model of leadership. and i think that's as possible today as it's ever been. so you think it's possible. like i was going to ask this, again, it may be a very shallow view, but it feels this country is more divided than it has been in recent history. perhaps the social media and all those kinds of things are merely revealing the division as opposed to creating the division. but is it possible to have a leader that unites in the same way that fdr did without, well, we're living through a pandemic. this is already- yes. so , i was going to say without suffering, but this is economic suffering. huge number of people have lost their jobs. is it possible to have, is there one, a hunger? is there a possibility to have an fdr style leader who unites? yes, i think that is what president biden is trying. i'm not saying he'll succeed, but i think that's what he's trying to do. the way you do this is you do not allow yourself to be captured by your opponents in congress or somewhere else. fdr had a lot of opponents in congress. he had a lot of opponents in politics, governors and others who didn't him. herbert hoover was still around and still accusing fdr of being a conspiratist and all these other things. so you don't allow yourself to be captured by the leaders of the other side. you go over their heads to the people. and so today, the way to do this is to explain to people and empathize with the suffering and dislocation and difficulties they're dealing with and show that you're trying to help them. not an easy solution, not a simple statement, but here are some things we can all do together. that's why i think infrastructure makes a lot of sense. it's what fdr invested into. fdr built hoover dam. hoover dam turned the lights on for young lyndon johnson who grew up outside of austin. fdr was the one who invested in road construction that was then continued by dwight eisenhower, by a republican with the interstate highway system. fdr invested through the wpa in building thousands of schools in our country, planting trees. that's the kind of work that can bring people together. you don't have to be a democrat or a republican to say, you know what, we'd be a lot better off in my community if we had better infrastructure today. i wanna be a part of that. oh, well, maybe i can get a job doing that. maybe my company can benefit from that. you bring people together and that way it becomes a common mission, even if we have different ideological positions. yeah, it's funny. i have, when i first heard joe biden, i think many years ago, i think he ran for president against obama. that's correct. and before i heard him speak, i really liked him. but once i heard him speak, i started to him less and less. and it speaks to something interesting where it's hard to put into words why you connect with people. the empathy that you mentioned in fdr, you have these bad, pardon the french, motherfuckers teddy roosevelt that connect with you. there's something just powerful. and with joe biden, i wanna really him and there's something not quite there where it feels he doesn't quite know my pain. even though he, on paper, is exactly, he knows the pain of the people and there's something not connecting. and it's hard to explain. it's hard to put into words. and it makes me not, as an engineer and scientist, it makes me not feel good about presidencies because it makes me feel it's more art than science. it is an art. and i think it's exactly an art for the reasons you laid out, it's aesthetic. it's about feeling, it's about emotion, all the things that we can't engineer. we've tried for centuries to engineer emotion. we're never gonna do it. don't try it. i'm a parent of teenagers. don't even try to explain emotion. but you hit on the key point and the key challenge for biden. he's gotta find the right words. it's not finding the words to bullshit people. it's finding the words to help express. we've all felt empowered and felt good. when someone uses words that put into words what we're feeling. that's what he needs. that's the job of a leader. and there's certain words, i haven't heard many politicians use those words, but there's certain words that make you forget that you're for immigration or against immigration, make you forget whether you're for wars and against wars. make you forget about the bickering and somehow inspire you, elevate you to believe in the greatness that this country could be. in that same way, the reason i moved to austin, it's funny to say, is i just heard words from people, from friends, where they're excited by the possibility of the future here. i wasn't thinking what's the right thing to do, what's the strategic, because i wanna launch a business. there's a lot of arguments for san francisco or maybe staying in boston in my case, but there's this excitement that was beyond reason, that was emotional. and that's what it seems , that's what builds, that's what great leaders do, but that's what builds countries, that's what build great businesses. that's right. and it's what people say about austin, for example, all the time, a talented people who come here yourself. and here's the interesting thing, no one person creates that. the words emerge. and part of what fdr understood is you've gotta find the words out there and use them. you don't have to be the creator of them. just as the great painter doesn't invent the painting, they're taking things from others. as a small aside, is there something you could say about fdr and hitler? i constantly tried to think, can this person, can this moment in history have been circumvented, prevented? can hitler have been stopped? can some of the atrocities from my own family that my grandparents had to live through the starvation in the soviet union? so the thing that people don't often talk about is the atrocities committed by stalin and his own people. it feels , here's this great leader, fdr, that had the chance to have an impact on the world that he already probably had a great positive impact, but had a chance to stop maybe world war ii or stop some of the evils. when you look at how weak hitler was from much of the 30s relative to militarily, relative to everything else, how many people could have done a lot to stop him? and fdr in particular didn't. he tried to play, not pacify, but basically do diplomacy and let germany do germany, let europe do europe and focus on america. is there something you would, would you hold his feet to the fire on this or is it very difficult from the perspective of fdr to have known what was coming? i think fdr had a sense of what was coming, not quite the enormity of what hitler was doing and not quite the enormity of what the holocaust became. i also lost relatives in the holocaust. and part of that was beyond the imagination of human beings. but it's clear in his papers that as early as 1934, people he respected who he knew well told him that hitler was very dangerous. they also thought hitler was crazy, that he was a lunatic. hamilton fisch armstrong, who was a friend of roosevelt's, who was actually the council on foreign relations in new york had a meeting with hitler in 1934. i remember reading the account of this and he basically said to fdr, this man is gonna cause a war, he's gonna cause a lot of damage. again, they didn't know quite the scale. so they saw this coming. they saw this coming. fdr had two problems. first, he had an american public that was deeply isolationist. the opposite of the problem in a sense that we were talking about before. if we're an over-militarized society, now we were a deeply isolationist society in the 1930s. the depression reinforced that. fdr actually had to break the law in the late 30s to support the allies. so it was very hard to move the country in that direction, especially when he had this program at home, the new deal, that he didn't wanna jeopardize by alienating an isolationist public. that was the reality. we talked about political manipulation. he had to be conscious of that. he had to know his audience. and second, there were no allies willing to invest in this either. the british were as committed to appeasement as you know, you're obviously very knowledgeable about this. the french were as well. it was very hard. the russian government, the soviet government, was cooperating to remilitarize germany. so there weren't a lot of allies out there either. i think if there's a criticism to be made of fdr, it's that once we're in the war, he didn't do enough to stop in particular the killing of jews. and there are a number of historians, myself included, who have written about this, and it's an endless debate. what should he have done? there's no doubt by 1944, the united states had air superiority and could have bombed the rail lines to auschwitz and other camps. that would have saved as many as a million jews. that's a lot of people who could have been saved. why didn't fdr insist on that? in part, because he wanted to use every resource possible to win the war. he did not wanna be accused of fighting the war for jews. but i think it's also fair to say that he probably cared less about jews and east europeans than he did about others, those of his own dutch ancestry and from western europe. and so, you know, even there race comes in is also the explanation for the internment of japanese in the united states, which is a horrible war crime committed by this heroic president. 120,000 japanese american citizens lost their freedom unnecessarily. so he had his limitations. and i think he could have done more during the war to save many more lives, and i wish he had. and there's something to be said about empathy that you spoke that fdr had empathy, but us, for example, now there's many people who describe the atrocities happening in china. and there's a bunch of places across the world where there's atrocities happening now, and we care. we do not uniformly apply how much we care for the suffering of others. that's correct. depending on the group. that's correct. and in some sense, the role of the president is to rise above that natural human inclination to do the us versus them, to protect the inner circle and empathize with the suffering of those that are not you. that's correct. i agree with that. yeah. speaking of war, you wrote a book on henry kissinger. it's not a great transition, but it made sense in my head. who was henry kissinger as a man and as a historical figure? so henry kissinger to me is one of the most fascinating figures in history because he comes to the united states as a german jewish immigrant at age 15 speaking no english. and within a few years, he's a major figure influencing us foreign policy at the height of us power. but while he's doing that, he's never elected to office and he's constantly reviled by people, including people who are anti-semitic because he's jewish. but at the same time also his exoticism makes him more attractive to people. so someone nelson rockefeller wants kissinger around. he's one of kissinger's first patrons because he wants a really smart jew. and kissinger is gonna be that smart jew. i call kissinger a policy jew. there were these court jews in the 16th and 17th and 18th centuries in europe. every king wanted the jew to manage his banking. and in a sense in the united states in the second half of the 20th century, many presidents want a jew to manage their international affairs. and what does that really mean? it's not just about being jewish, it's the internationalism, it's the cosmopolitanism. and that's one of the things i was fascinated with with kissinger. someone kissinger is unthinkable as a powerful figure in the united states 30 or 40 years earlier because the united states is run by wasps. it's run by white elites who come from a certain background. kissinger represents a moment when american society opens up, not to everyone, but opens up to these cosmopolitan figures who have language skills, historical knowledge, networks that can be used for the us government when after world war ii, we have to rebuild europe, when we have to negotiate with the soviet union, when we need the kinds of knowledge we didn't have before. and harvard, where he gets his education late, he started at city college actually, but harvard where he gets his education late is at the center of what's happening at all these major universities, at harvard, at yale, at stanford, at the university of texas, everywhere, where they're growing in their international affairs, bringing in the kinds of people who never would be at the university before, training them, and then enlisting them in cold war activities. and so kissinger is a representative of that phenomenon. i became interested in him because i think he's a bellwether. he shows how power has changed in the united states. so he enters this whole world of politics, what, post-world war ii in the 50s? yes, so he actually, in the 40s even, it's an extraordinary story. he comes to the united states in 1938, just before kristallnacht, his family leaves. he actually grew up right outside of nuremberg. they leave right before kristallnacht in fall of 38. come to new york, he originally works in a brush factory cleaning brushes, goes to a public high school. and in 1942, just after pearl harbor, he joins the military. and he's very quickly in the military, first of all, given citizenship, which he didn't have before. he's sent for the first time outside of a kosher home. he had been in a kosher home his entire life. he's sent to south carolina to eat ham for uncle sam. and then he is, and this is extraordinary, at the age of 20, barely speaking english, he is sent back to germany with the us army in an elite counterintelligence role. why? because they need german speakers. he came when he was 15, so he actually understands the society. they need people who have that cultural knowledge. and because he's jewish, they can trust that he'll be anti-nazi. and there's a whole group of these figures. he's one of many. and so he's in an elite circle. he's discriminated against in new york. when he goes to harvard after that, he can only live in a jewish-only dorm. but at the same time, he's in an elite policy role in counterintelligence. he forms a network there that stays with him the rest of his career. there's a gentleman named fritz kramer, who becomes a sponsor of his in the emerging pentagon defense department world. and as early as the early 1950s, he sent them to korea to comment on affairs in korea. he becomes both an intellectual recognized for his connections, but also someone who policymakers wanna talk about. his book on nuclear weapons, when it's written, is given to president eisenhower to read, because they say, this is someone writing interesting things. you should read what he says. there's a certain aspect to him that's kinda forrest gump. he seems to continuously be the right person at the right time in the right place. that's right. somehow finding him in this, i don't wanna, you know, you can only get lucky so many times because he continues to get lucky in terms of being at the right place in history for many decades, until today. yeah, well, he has a knack for that. i spent a lot of time talking with him. and what comes through very quickly is that he has an eye for power. it's, i think, unhealthy. he's obsessed with power. can you explain an observer of power or does he want power himself? yes, both of those things. both of those. and i think i explained this in the book. he doesn't agree with what i'm gonna say now, but i think i'm right. and i think he's right. it's very hard to analyze yourself, right? yeah. i think he develops an obsession with gaining power because he sees what happens when you have no power. he experiences the trauma. his father is a very respected gymnasi lehrer in germany. even though he's jewish, he's actually the teacher of german classics to the german kids. this is great. and he's forced to flee and he becomes nothing. his father never really makes a way for himself in the united states. he becomes a postal delivery person, which is nothing wrong with that. but for someone who's a respected teacher in germany and gymnasi lehrer are professors there, right? to then be in this position. his mother has to open a catering business when they come to new york. it's a typical immigrant story, but he sees the trauma. his grandparents are killed by the nazis. so he sees the trauma and he realizes how perilous it is to be without power. and you're saying he does not want to acknowledge the effect of that. it's hard. i mean, most of us, if we've had trauma, it's believable that it's traumatic because you don't talk about it. i have a friend who interviews combat veterans and he says, as soon as someone freely wants to tell me about their combat trauma, i suspect that they're not telling me the truth. if it's traumatic, it's hard to talk about. yeah, sometimes i wonder how much for my own life, everything that i've ever done is just the result of the complicated relationship with my father. i tend to, i had a really difficult time. i did a podcast conversation with him. i saw it actually. yeah, it's great. it's great. i regret everything. i could never do that with my father. but i remember as i was doing it and for months after i regretted doing it, i just kept regretting it. and the fact that i was regretting it spoke to the fact that i'm running away from some truths that are back there somewhere. and that's perhaps what kissinger is as well. but is there, i mean, he's been a part of so many interesting moments of american history, of world history, from the cold war, vietnam war, until today. what stands out to you as a particularly important moment in his career that made who he is? well, i think what made his career in many ways was his experience in the 1950s, building a network, a network of people across the world who were rising leaders from unique positions. he ran what he called the international seminar at harvard, which was actually a summer school class that no one at harvard cared about. but he invited all of these rising intellectuals and thinkers from around the world. and he built a network there that he used forevermore. so that's what really, i think, boosts him. the most important moments in terms of making his reputation, making his career, are two sets of activities. one is the opening to china. and his ability to, first of all, take control of us policy without the authority to do that and direct us policy, and then build a relationship with mao zedong and zhou enlai that was unthinkable just four or five years earlier. of course, president nixon is a big part of that as well, but kissinger is the mover and shaker on that. and it's a lot of manipulation, but it's also a vision. now this is in the moment of american history where there's a very powerful anti-communism. correct. so communism is seen as much more even than today as the enemy. correct. and china in particular, they were one of our key enemies in vietnam. and in korea, american forces were fighting chinese forces directly. chinese forces come over the border, thousands of americans die at the hand of chinese forces. so for the long time, the united states had no relationship with communist china. he opens that relationship. and at the same time, he also creates a whole new dynamic in the middle east. after the 1973 war, the so-called yom kippur war, he steps in and becomes the leading negotiator between the israelis, the egyptians, and other major actors in the region. and it makes the united states the most powerful actor in the middle east, the soviet union far less powerful, which is great for the united states in the 70s and 80s. it gets us though into the problems we of course have thereafter. so that speaks to the very pragmatic approach that he's taken, the realistic approach versus the idealistic approach, termed realpolitik. what is this thing? what is this approach to world politics? so realpolitik for kissinger is really focusing on the power centers in the world and trying as best you can to manipulate those power centers to serve the interests of your own country. and so that's why he's a multilateralist. he's not a unilateralist. he believes the united states should put itself at the center of negotiations between other powerful countries. but that's also why he pays very little attention to countries that are less powerful. and this is why he's often criticized by human rights activists. for him, parts of africa and latin america, which you and i would consider important places are unimportant because they don't have power. they can't project their power. they don't produce a lot of economic wealth. and so they matter less. realpolitik views the world in a hierarchy of power. how does realpolitik realize itself in the world? what does that really mean? like how do you push forward the interests of your own country? you said there's power centers, but it is a big bold move to negotiate, to work with a communist nation, with your enemies that are powerful. what is the sort of, if you can further elaborate the philosophy behind it. sure, so there are two key elements that then end up producing all kinds of tactics, but the two strategic elements of kissinger's way of thinking about realpolitik, which are classical ways, going back to thucydides and the greeks, are to say, first of all, you figure out who your allies are and you build webs of connection so that your allies help you to acquire what you want to acquire. this is why, according to herodotus, the greeks beat the persians. the persians are bigger, but the greeks, the spartans, the athenians, all those are able to work together and leverage their resources. so it's about leveraging your resources for kissinger. this makes western europe crucially important. it makes japan crucially important. it makes israel and egypt crucially important, right, in building these webs. you build your surrogates, you build your brother states. in other parts of the world, you build tight connections and you work together to control the resources that you want. the second element of the strategy is not to go to war with your adversary, but to do all you can to limit the power of your adversary. some of that is containment, preventing the soviet union from expanding. that was the key element of american cold war policy. but sometimes it's actually negotiation. that's what détente was about for kissinger. he spends a lot of time, more time than any other american foreign policymaker, negotiating with soviet leaders, as well as chinese leaders. what does he want to do? he wants to limit the nuclear arms race. the united states is ahead. we don't want the soviet union to get ahead of us. we negotiate to limit their abilities, right? we play to our strengths. so it's a combination of keeping your adversary down and building tight webs. within that context, military force is used, but you're not using war for the sake of war. you're using warfare to further your access to the resources, economic, political, geographic that you want. to build relationships, and then the second thing, to limit the powers of those you're against. exactly. so is there any sort of insights into how he preferred to build relationships? are we talking about, again, it's the one-on-one? is it through policy or is it through phone conversations? is there any cool insights that you could speak to? yeah, kissinger is the ultimate kiss-up. he is, some used to make fun of him. in fact, even the filmmaker from dr. strangelove, whose name i'm forgetting, stanley kubrick, called him kiss-up at that time, right? he had a wonderful way of figuring out what it is you wanted, back to that discussion we had before, and trying to show how he could give you more of what you wanted as a leader. it was very personalistic, very personalistic. and he spends a lot of time, for example, kissing up to leonid brezhnev, kissing up to mao. he tells mao, you're the greatest leader in the history of the 20th century. people will look back on you as the great leader. some of this sounds bs, but it's serious, right? he's feeding the egos of those around him. second, he is willing to get things done for you. he's effective. you want him around you because of his efficacy. so richard nixon is always suspicious that henry kissinger's getting more of the limelight. he hates that kissinger gets the nobel peace prize and he doesn't, but he needs him. because kissinger's the guy who gets things done. so he performs, he builds a relationship, in almost, i say this in the book, in almost a gangster way he didn't , that he criticized that part of the book. but again, i still think the evidence is there. you need something to be done, boss, i'll do it. and don't forget that i'm doing this for you. and you get mutual dependency in a hegelian way, right? yeah. and so he builds this personal dependency through ego and through performance. and then he's so skillful at making decisions for people who are more powerful, because he's never elected to office. he always needs powerful people to let him do things. but he convinces you it's your decision when it's really his. to read his memos are beautiful. he's actually very skilled at writing things in a way that looks he's giving you options as president, but in fact, there's only one option there. is he, speaking to the gangster, to the loyalty, is he ever, the sense i got from nixon is he would, nixon would backstab you if he needed to. one of the things that i admire about gangsters is they don't backstab those in the inner circle, loyalty above all else. i mean, at least that's the sense i've gotten from the stories of the past, at least. is, where would you put kissinger on that? is he loyalty above all else? or is it, are human, it's the steve jobs thing, is , as long as you're useful, you're useful, but then once, long use, the moment you're no longer useful is when you're knocked off the chessboard. it's the latter with him. he's backstabbing quite a lot. and he's self-serving. but he also makes himself so useful that even though nixon knows he's doing that, nixon still needs him. yeah. by the way, on that point, so having spoken with kissinger, what's your relationship with him as somebody who is in an objective way writing his story? it was very difficult because he's very good at manipulating people. and we had about 12 or 13 interviews, usually informal over lunch. and this was many years ago, this is probably now more than 10 years ago. did you find yourself being sweet-talked, to where you go back home later and look in the mirror and it's , wait, what just happened? he can be enormously charming and enormously obnoxious at the same time. so i would have these very mixed emotions because he gives no ground. he is unwilling to, and i think this is a weakness, he's unwilling to admit mistake. others make mistakes, but he doesn't. and he certainly won't take on any of the big criticisms that are pushed. i understand why. i mean, when you've worked as hard for what he has as he has, you're defensive about it. but he is very defensive and he's very fragile about it. he does not criticisms at all. he used to, he hasn't done this in a while, but he used to call me up and yell at me on the phone, quite literally, when i would be quoted in the new york times or somewhere saying something that sounded critical of him. so for instance, there was one instance a number of years ago where a reporter came across some documents where kissinger said negative things about jews in russia, typical things that a german jew would say about east european jews. and the new york times asked me, is this accurate? and i said, yeah, the documents are accurate. i've seen them, they're accurate. he was so angry about that. so there's the fragility, but there's also the enormous charm and the enormous intelligence. the real challenge with him though is he's very good at making his case. he'll convince you. and as a scholar, as an observer, you don't wanna hear a lawyer's case. you wanna actually interrogate the evidence and get to the truth. and so that was a real challenge with him. so speaking of his approach of realpolitik, if we just zoom out and look at a human history, human civilization, what do you think works best in the way we progress forward? a realistic approach, do whatever it takes, control the centers of power, to play a game for the greater interests of the good guys, quote unquote, or lead by sort of idealism, which is truly act in the best version of the ideas you represent as opposed to kind of present one view and then do whatever it takes behind the scenes. obviously you need some of both, but i lean more to the idealistic side and more so actually believe it or not, as i get into my forties, as i do more historical work. why do i say that? because i think, and this is one of my criticisms of kissinger, who i also have a lot of respect for, the realpolitik becomes self-defeating because you're constantly running to keep power, but you forget why. and you often then use power, and i think kissinger falls into this in some of his worst moments, not all of his moments, where the power is actually being used to undermine the things you care about. it's sort of the example of being a parent and you're doing all these things to take your kid to violin, basketball, all these things, and you realize you're actually killing your kid and making your kid very unhappy. and the whole reason you were doing it was to improve the person's life. and so you have to remember why it is, what hans morgenthau calls this is your purpose. your purpose has to drive you. now your purpose doesn't have to be airy-fairy idealism. so i believe deeply in democracy as an ideal. i don't think it's gonna ever look athenian democracy, but that should drive our policy. but we still have to be realistic and recognize we're not gonna build that democracy in afghanistan tomorrow. i mean, does it ultimately just boil down again to the corrupting nature of power that nobody can hold power for very long before you start acting in the interest of power as opposed to in the interest of your ideals? it's impossible to be somebody kissinger who is essentially in power for many, many decades and still remember what are the initial ideals that you strove to achieve. yes, i think that's exactly right. there's a moment in the book i quote about him comes from one of our interviews. i asked him, what were the guiding ideals for your policies? and he said, i'm not prepared to share that. and i don't think it's because he doesn't know what he thinks he was trying to do. he realizes his use of power departed quite a lot from. so it would sound, if he made them explicit, it would sound hypocritical. correct. well, on that, let me ask about war. america often presents itself to its own people, but just the leaders, when they look in the mirror, i get a sense that we think of ourselves as the good guys. especially this begins sometimes to look hypocritical when you're waging war. is there a good way to know when you've lost all sense of what it is to be good? another way to ask that, is there in military policy, in conducting war, is there a good way to know what is a just war and what is a war crime? i mean, in some circles, kissinger is accused of contributing, being a war criminal. yes, and i argue in the book he's not a war criminal, but that doesn't mean that he didn't misuse military power. i think a just war, a just war as michael walzer and others write about it, a just war is a war where both the purpose is just and you are using the means to get to that purpose that kill as few people as necessary. that doesn't mean they won't be killing, but as few as necessary, proportionality, right? your means should be proportional to your ends. and that's often lost sight of, because the drive to get to the end often self-justifies means that go well beyond that. and so that's how we get into torture in the war on terror. is there some kind of lesson for the future? yes. you can take away from that? yes, i think the first set of lessons that i've shared as a historian with military decision makers is, first of all, always remember why you're there, what your purpose is, and always ask yourself if the means you're using, if the means you're using are actually proportional. ask that question. just because you have these means that you can use, just because you have these tools, doesn't mean they're the right tools to use. and here's the question that follows from that. and it's a hard question to ask, because the answer is one we often don't to hear. are the things i'm doing in war actually doing more harm or more good to the reason i went into war? we came to a point in the war on terror where what we were doing was actually creating more terrorists. and that's when you have to stop. well, some of that is in the data, but some of it, there's a leap of faith. so from a parenting perspective, let me speak as a person with no kids and a single guy. let me be the expert in the room on parenting. no, it does seem that it's a very difficult thing to do to even though you know that your kid was making a mistake, to let them make a mistake, to give them the freedom to make the mistake. sure. i don't know what to do, but i mean, that's a very kind of lighthearted way of phrasing the following, which is when you look at some of the places in the world, afghanistan, which is not doing well. right. to move out knowing that there's going to be a lot of suffering, economic suffering, injustices, terrorist organizations growing, that committing crimes on its own people and potentially committing crimes against allies, violence against allies, violence against the united states. how do you know what to do in that case? well, again, it's an art, not a science, which is what makes it hard for an engineer to think about. this is what makes it endlessly fascinating for me. and i think the real intellectual work is at the level of the art, right? and i think probably engineering at its highest level becomes an art as well, right? so policymaking, you never know, but i will say this. i'll say you have to ask yourself and look in the mirror and say, is all the effort i'm putting in actually making this better? and in afghanistan, you look at the 20 years and two plus trillion dollars that the us has put in. and the fact that, as you said correctly, it's not doing well right now, after 20 years of that investment, i might a company that i invest in, but after 20 years of my throwing money in that company, it's time to get out. well, in some sense, getting out now is, that's kind of obvious. i'm more interested in how we figure out in the future how to get out earlier. i mean, at this point, we stayed too long and it's obvious, the data, the investment, nothing is working. the very little data points to us staying there. i'm more interested in being in a relationship, let me take it back to a safer place again, being in a relationship and getting out of that relationship while things are still good, but you have a sense that it's not going to end up in a good place. that's the difficult thing. you have to ask yourself whether it's a relationship or you're talking about policymaking in a place afghanistan, are the things i'm doing showing me evidence, real evidence that they're making things better or making things worse? that's a hard question to ask. be honest with yourself. you have to be very honest and in a policymaking context, we have to actually do the same thing we do in a relationship context. what do we do in a relationship context? we ask other friends who are observing. we ask for other observers. this is actually just a scientific method element, actually, that we can't, the heisenberg principle, i can't see it because i'm too close to it. i'm changing it by my looking at it. i need others to tell me in a policymaking context, this is why you need to hear from other people, not just the generals, because here's the thing about the generals. they generally are patriotic, hardworking people, but they're too close. they're not lying. they're too close. they always think they can do better. yeah. how do you think about the cold war now from the beginning to end? and maybe also with an eye towards the current potential cyber conflict, cyber war with china and with russia, if we look sort of other kind of cold wars potentially emerging in the 21st century, when you look back at the cold war of the 20th century, how do you see it and what lessons do we draw from it? it's a wonderful question because i teach this to undergraduates and it's really interesting to see how undergraduates now, almost all of whom were born after 9-11. yeah. so the cold war is ancient history to them. in fact, the cold war to them is as far removed as the 1950s were to me. i mean, it's unbelievable. it's almost world war ii for my generation and cold war for them. it's so far removed. the collapse of the soviet union doesn't mean anything to them. so- so how do you describe the cold war to them? how do you describe the soviet union to them? first of all, i have to explain to them why people were so fearful of communism. anti-communism is very hard for them to understand. the fact that in the 1950s, americans believed that communists were going to infiltrate our society and many other societies and that after fidel castro comes to power in 1959, that we're going to see communist regimes all across latin america, that fear of communism married to nuclear power and then even the fear that maybe economically they would outpace us because they would create this sort of army of khrushchevian, you know, builders of things. and you know, what does khrushchev said, right? say we're going to catch britain in five years and then the united states after that, right? so to explain that sense of fear to them that they don't have of those others, that's really important. the cold war was fundamentally about the united states defending a capitalist world order against a serious challenger from communism. an alternative way of organizing everything, private property, economic activity, enterprise, life, everything organized in a totally different way. it was a struggle between two systems. so your sense is, and sorry to interrupt, but your sense is that the conflict of the cold war was between two ideologies and not just two big countries with nuclear weapons. i think it was about two different ways of life or two different promoted ways of life. the soviet union never actually lived communism, but i think my reading of stalin is he really tried to go there. khrushchev really believed gorbachev thought he was going to reform the soviet union so you would go back to a kind of buhar and lenin communism, right? so i do think that mattered. i do think that mattered enormously. and for the united states point of view, the view was that communism and fascism were these totalitarian threats to liberal democracy and capitalism, which went hand in hand. so i do think that's what the struggle was about. and in a certain way, liberal capitalism proved to be the more enduring system and the united states played a key role in that. that's the reality of the cold war, but i think it means different things now to my students and others. they focus very much on the expansion of american power and the challenges of managing. they're looking at it from the perspective of not will we survive, but did we waste our resources on some elements of it? it doesn't mean they were against what america did, but there is a question of the resources that went into the cold war and the opportunity costs. and you see this when you look at the sort of healthcare systems that other countries build and you compare them to the united states. race issues also. so they look at the costs, which i think often happens after a project is done, you look back at that. second, i think they're also more inclined to see the world as less bipolar, to see the role of china as more complicated. post-colonial or anti-colonial movements, independent states in africa and latin america, that gets more attention. so one of the criticisms now is because you forget the lessons of 20th century history and the atrocities committed under communism, that you may be a little bit more willing to accept some of those ideologies into our united states society. that forgetting that capitalistic forces are part of the reason why we have what we have today. there's a fear amongst some now that we would have, we would allow basically communism to take hold in america. i mean, jordan and others speak to this kind of idea. i tend to not be so fearful of it. i think it's on the surface, it's not deep within. i do see the world as very complicated as they're needing to be a role of having support for each other on certain political levels, economic levels, and then also supporting entrepreneurs. it's that the kind of enforcing of outcomes that is fundamental to the communist system is not something we're actually close to. and some of that is just fear mongering for likes on twitter kind of thing. if i could come in on that, because i agree with you 100. i've spent a lot of time writing and looking at this and talking to people about this. there's no communism in the united states. there never has been, and there certainly isn't now. and i'll say this both from an academic point of view, but also from just spending a lot of time observing young people in the united states. even those on the farthest left, take whoever you think is the farthest left. they don't even understand what communism is. they're not communist in any sense. americans are raised in a vernacular and environment of private property ownership. and as you know better than anyone, if you believe in private property, you don't believe in communism. so what the sort of bernie sanders kind of socialist elements that's very different, right? and i would say some of that, not all of that, some of that does hearken back to actually what won in the cold war. there were many social democratic elements of what the united states did that led to our winning the cold war. for example, the new deal was investing government money in propping up business, in propping up labor unions. and during the cold war, we spent more money than we had ever spent in our history on infrastructure, on schools, on providing social support, social security, our national pension system being one of them. so you could argue actually that social democracy is very compatible with capitalism. and i think that's the debate we're having today, how much social democracy. i'd also say that the capitalism we've experienced, the last 20 years is different from the capitalism of the cold war. during the cold war, there was the presumption in the united states that you had to pay taxes to support our cold war activities, that it was okay to make money, but the more money you made, the more taxes you had to pay. we had the highest marginal tax rates in our history during the cold war. now the aversion to taxes, and of course no one ever likes paying taxes, but the notion that we can do things on deficit spending, that's a post-cold war phenomenon. that's not a cold war phenomenon. so much of the capitalism that we're talking about today is not the capitalism of the cold war. and maybe, again, we can learn that and see how we can reform capitalism today and get rid of this false worry about communism in the united states. yeah, you know what? you make me actually realize something important. what we have to remember is the words we use on the surface about different policies, what you think is right and wrong, is actually different than the core thing that is in your blood, the core ideas that are there. i do see the united states as this, there's this fire that burns of individual freedoms, of property rights, these basic foundational ideas that everybody just kind of takes for granted. and i think if you hold on to them, if you're raised in them, talking about ideas of social security, of universal basic income, of reallocation of resources is a fundamentally different kind of discussion than you had in the soviet union. i think the value of the individual is so core to the american system that you basically cannot possibly do the kind of atrocities that you saw in the soviet union. but of course, you never know, the slippery slope has a way of changing things, but i do believe the things you're born with is just so core to this country. it's part of the, i don't know what your thoughts are, we are in texas. not necessarily, i don't necessarily wanna have a gun control type of conversation, but the reason i really guns, it doesn't make any sense, but philosophically, it's such a declaration of individual rights that's so different than the conversations i hear with my russian family and my russian friends. that the gun, it's very possible that having guns is bad for society in the sense that , it'll lead to more violence, but there's something about this discussion that , that proclaims the value of my freedom as an individual. i'm not being eloquent in it, but there's very few debates where whenever people are saying, should you have what level of gun control, all those kinds of things, what i hear is it's a fight for how much freedom, even if it's stupid freedom, should the individual have. i think that's what's articulated quite often. i think combining your two points, which are great points, i think there is something about american individualism, which is deeply ingrained in our culture and our society. and it means that the kinds of bad things that happen are different, usually not as bad, but our individualism often covers up for vigilante activity and individual violence toward people that you wouldn't have in a more collective culture. so in the soviet union, it was at a much worse scale and it was done by government organizations. in the united states, it's individuals, the history of lynching in our country, for example. sometimes it's individual police officers, sometimes it's others. again, the vast majority of police officers are good people and don't do harm to people, but there are these examples and they are able to fester in our society because of our individualism. now, gun ownership is about personal freedom, i think, for a lot of people. and there's no doubt that in our history, included in the second amendment, which can be interpreted in different ways, is the presumption that people should have the right to defend themselves, which is what i think you're getting at here, that you should not be completely dependent for your defense on an entity that might not be there for you. you should be able to defend yourself. and guns symbolize that. i think that's a fair point. but i think it's also a fair point to say that as with everything, defining what self-defense is, is really important. so does self-defense mean i can have a bazooka? does it mean i can have weapons that are designed for a military battlefield to mass kill people? that seems to me to be very different from saying i should have a handgun or some small arm to defend myself. that distinction alone would make a huge difference. most of the mass shootings, at least, which are a proportion, a smaller proportion of the larger gun deaths in the united states, which are larger than any other society, but at least the mass shootings are usually perpetrated by people who have not self-defense weapons, but mass killing, mass killing weapons. and i think there's an important distinction there. the constitution talks about a right to bear arms for a well-regulated militia. when the framers talked about arms, that did not mean the ability to kill as many people as you want to kill. it meant the ability to defend yourself. so let's have that conversation. i think it would be useful as a society. stop talking about guns or no guns. what is it that we as citizens need to feel we can defend ourselves? yes. yeah, i mean, guns have this complicated issue that it can cause harm to others. i tend to see sort of maybe in drug, legalization of drugs, i tend to believe that we should have the freedom to do stupid things. yeah. so long as we're not harming lots of other people. yes. and then guns, of course, have the property that they can be used. it's not just a bazooka i would argue is pretty stupid to own for your own self-defense, but it has the very negative side effect of being potentially used to harm other people. right, right. and you have to consider that kind of stuff. by the way, as a side note to the listeners, there's been a bunch of people saying that lex is way too libertarian for my taste. no, i actually am just struggling with ideas and sometimes put on different hats in these conversations. i think through different ideas, whether they're left, right or libertarian. that's true for gun control, that's true for immigration, that's true for all of that. i think we should have discussions in the space of ideas versus in the space of bins we put each other in, labels and we'll put each other in. i agree 100. and also change our minds all the time. try out, say stupid stuff with the best of intention, trying our best to think through it, and then after saying it, think about it for a few days and then change your mind and grow in this way. let me ask a ridiculous question. when you zoom out, when human civilization has destroyed itself and alien graduate students are studying it three, four, five centuries from now, what do you think we'll remember about this period in history? the 20th century, the 21st century, this time we had a couple of wars, we had a charismatic black president in the united states, we had a couple of pandemics. what do you think will actually stand out in history? no doubt the rapid technological innovation of the last 20 to 30 years, how we created a whole virtual universe we didn't have before. and of course that's gonna go in directions you and i can't imagine 50 years from now, but this will be seen as that origin moment that when we went from playing below the rim to playing above the rim, right? to be all in person, to having a whole virtual world. and in a strange way, the pandemic was a provocation to move even further in that direction. and we're never going back, right? we're gonna restore some of the things we were doing before the pandemic, but we're never gonna go back to that world we were in before where every meeting you had to fly to that place to be in the room with the people. so this whole virtual world and the virtual personas and avatars and all of that, i think that's going to be a big part of how people remember our time. also the sort of biotechnology element of it, which the vaccines are part of. it's amazing how quickly, this is the great triumph, how quickly we've produced and distributed these vaccines. and of course there are problems with who's taking them, but the reality is, i mean, this is light speed compared to what it would have been , not just in 1918, in 1980. yeah, one of the, and sorry if i'm interrupting, but one of the disappointing things about this particular time is because vaccines, a lot of things got politicized, used as little pawns in the game of politics, that we don't get the chance to step back, fully at least, and celebrate the brilliance of the human species. that's right. that's right. yes, there are scientists who use their authority improperly that have an ego that when they're within institutions, are dishonest with the public because they don't trust the intelligence of the public, they are not authentic and transparent. all the same things you could say about humans in any positions of power, anywhere. okay, that doesn't mean science isn't incredible and the vaccines, i mean, i don't often talk about it because it's so political and it's heartbreaking to, it's heartbreaking how all the good stuff is getting politicized. yeah, that's right. and it shouldn't be, it'll seem less political. in the long arc of history. yep, it'll be seen as an outstanding accomplishment. and as a step toward whatever, maybe they're doing vaccines or something that replaces the vaccine in 10 seconds, at that point, right? it'll be seen as a step to, those will be some of the positives. i think one of the negatives they will point to will be our inability, at least at this moment, to manage our environment better, how we're destroying our living space and not doing enough, even though we have the capabilities to do more to preserve or at least allow a sustainable living space. i'm confident because i'm an optimist that we will get through this and we will be better at sustaining our environment in future decades. and so in terms of environmental policy, they'll see this moment as a dark age or the beginnings of a better age, maybe as a renaissance. or maybe as the last time most people lived on earth when a couple of centuries afterwards, we were all dissipated throughout the solar system and in the galaxy. very possible. if the local resident, hometown resident, mr. elon musk has anything to do with it. i do tend to think you're absolutely right. with all this political bickering, we shouldn't forget that what this age will be remembered by is the incredible levels of innovation. i do think the biotech stuff worries me more than anything because it feels there's a lot of weapons that could be yet to be developed in that space. but i tend to believe that, i'm excited by two avenues. one is artificial intelligence. the kind of systems we'll create in this digital space that you mentioned you were moving to. and then the other, of course, this could be the product of the cold war, but i'm super excited by space exploration. sure. there's a magic to humans being this big. and we're getting back to it. i mean, we were enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s when it was a cold war competition. and then after the 70s, we sort of gave up on it. and thanks to elon musk and others, we're coming back to this issue. and i think there's so much to be gained from the power of exploration. is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that had big impact on you? yes. and could be something you were... yes. my favorite novel, i always tell people this, i love reading novels. i'm a historian and i think the historian and the novelist are actually, and the technology innovator are all actually one and the same, we're all... storytellers. storytellers. and we're all in the imagination space. and i'm trying to imagine the world of the past to inform us in the present for the future. so one of my favorite novels that i read, actually when i was in graduate school, is thomas mann's buddenbrooks. and it's the story of a family in lübeck in northern germany, living through the 19th century and the rise and fall of family, cycles of life. many things we've talked about in the last couple of hours. cycles of life, challenges of adjusting to the world around you. and it's just a very moving reflection on the limits of human agency and how we all have to understand the circumstances we're in and adjust to them. and there's triumph and tragedy in that. it's a wonderful novel. it used to be a kind of canonical work. it's sort of fallen out now. it's a big, big novel, but i'm very moved by that. i'm very moved by tolstoy's war and peace. i assign that every year to my students. that's a big, big book. but what tolstoy challenges is he challenges the notion that a napoleon can rule the world. and we're all little napoleons, right? we're all sort of thinking that we're gonna do that. and he reminds us how much is contingency, circumstance. it doesn't mean we don't have some control. you've spoke to me a little bit of russian. where does that come from? so your appreciation of tolstoy, but also your ability to speak a bit of russian. where's that from? so i speak, in addition to english, i speak reasonably well, depending on how much vodka i've had. russian, i speak french and german. i learned those for research purposes. i learned french actually, when i was in high school. russian, when i was in college. german, when i was in graduate school. now i do have family on my mother's side that's of russian jewish extraction, but they were yiddish speakers by the time i met them. by the time they had gone through germany and come to the united states, or really gone through poland and come to the united states, they were yiddish speakers. so there's no one really in my family who speaks russian, but i do feel a connection there, at least a long range personal connection. is there something to be said about the language and your ability to imagine history? sort of when you study these different countries, your ability to imagine what it was to be a part of that culture, part of that time? yes, language is crucial to understanding a culture. and even if you learn the language as i have, learning russian and german and french, it's still not the same as also being a native speaker either, as you know. but i think language tells you a lot about mannerism, about assumptions. the very fact that english doesn't have a formal u, but russian has a formal u, right? v-i versus t-i, right? german has a formal u, z versus d, right? so the fact that english doesn't have a formal u tells you something about americans, right? and that's just one example. the fact that germans have such a wider vocabulary for certain scientific concepts than we have in english tells you something about the culture, right? language is an artifact of the culture. the culture makes the language. it's fascinating to explore. i mean, even just exactly what you just said, v-i-t-i, which is, there's a fascinating transition. so i guess in english, we just have u. yeah. there's a fascinating transition that persists to this day is of formalism and politeness, where it's an initial kind of dance of interaction that's different methods of signaling respect, i guess. and language provides that. and then in the english language, there's fewer tools to show that kind of respect, which has potentially positive or negative effects on, it flattens the society where a teenager could talk to an older person and show a deference. but at the same time, i mean, it creates a certain kind of dynamic, a certain kind of society. and it's funny to think of just those few words can have a ripple effect through the whole culture. and we don't have a history in the united states of aristocracy. yeah. these elements of language reflect aristocracy. the serf would never refer to the master, even if the master is younger, it's always voi, right? in turgenev, it's always voi, right? i mean, and so it's, yeah. so it tells you something about the history. that's why to your question, which was a great question, it's so crucial to try to penetrate the language. i'll also say something else. and this is a problem for many americans who haven't learned a foreign language. we're very bad at teaching foreign languages. if you've never taught yourself a foreign language, you have closed yourself off to certain kinds of empathy because you have basically trained your brain to only look at the world one way. the very act of learning another language, i think tells your brain that words and concepts don't translate one to one. this is the first thing you realize, right? we can say, you know, these two words mean the same thing from two languages, they never mean exactly the same thing. dosvidania is really not goodbye. yes. right? and there's something, you know, right now there's people talking about idea of lived experience. one of the ways to force yourself into this idea of lived experience is by learning another language. that's right. to understand that you can perceive the world in a totally different way, even though you're perceiving the same thing. and of course, the way to first learn russian for those looking for tutorial lessons for me is just , as you said, you start by drinking lots of vodka. yes, of course. it's very difficult to do otherwise. is there advice you have for young people about career, about life, in making their way in the world? yes. two things i believe that i say to a lot of talented young people. first, i don't think you can predict what is gonna be well-renumerated 20 years from now. don't pick a profession because you think, even though your parents might tell you, or do this and you'll make money. you know, this is the scene in the graduate where a guy tells dustin hoffman, go into plastics, money in plastics. so many of my students now have parents who are telling them, bright students, go to the business school. that's what's gonna set you up to make money. if you're passionate about business, yes, but don't begin by thinking you know what's gonna be hot 20 years from now. you don't know what's gonna be hot from 20 years ago, 20 years from now. what should you do? this is advice number one, find what you're passionate about. because if you're passionate about it, you will do good work in that area if you're talented and usually passion and talent overlap. and you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it. i mean, you do it really well, people will wanna pay. that's where capitalism works. people will find it valuable, right? whether it's violin playing, right? or engineering or poetry, you will find. you might not become a billionaire, that involves other things, but you'll find a way to get people to pay you for it. and then the second thing is, it's really important at the very beginning of your career, even before you're in your job, right? to start building your networks. but networks are not just people you're on facebook with or twitter with, i mean, that's fine. it's actually forming relationships. and some of that can be mediated in the digital world, but i mean real relationships. i podcasts because i think they actually open up that space. i know a lot of people can listen to a podcast and find someone else who's listened to that podcast and have a conversation about a topic. it opens up that space. build those relationships, not with people who you think will be powerful, but people you think are interesting, because they'll do interesting things. and every successful person i know, at some level, had a key moment where they got where they are because of someone they knew for some other reason who had that connection. so use and spread your networks and make them as diverse as possible. find people who are of a different party, have different interests, but are interesting to you. that's brilliant advice. some of that on the passion side, i do find that as somebody who has a lot of passions, i find the second part to that is committing. yes, that's true too. which sucks because life is finite. and when you commit, you say, well, i'm never going to be good. like when you choose one of the two passions, one of the two things you're interested in, you're basically saying, i'm letting go, i'm saying the sudanya to- that's true, that's true. which is actually what does sudanya means, not goodbye, but letting go. that's exactly right. i think that's exactly right. i think you do have to make choices. you do have to set priorities. i often laugh at students who tell me they want to have three majors. if you have three majors, you have no major, right? i mean, so i do think you have to make choices. i also think it's important that whatever you do, even if it's a small thing, you always do the best you can. you always do excellent work. my kids are tired of hearing me say this at home, but i believe everything you do should be about excellence. the best you can do. if i'm going to wash the dishes, i'm going to be the best person washing the dishes. if i'm going to write a book review, i'm going to write the best possible book review i can. why? because you develop a culture about yourself, which is about excellence. yeah, i was telling you offline about all the kind of stuff, google fiber and cable installation, all that stuff. i've been always a believer washing dishes. people don't often believe me when i say this. i don't care what i do. i am with david foster wallace. i'm unboreable. there is so much joy for me, i think for everyone, but okay, let me just speak for me, to be discovered in getting really good at anything. in fact, getting good at stuff that most people believe is boring or menial labor or impossible to be interesting. that's even more joyful to find the joy within that and the excellence. it's the giro dreams of sushi making the same fricking sushi over and over and becoming a master. that can be truly joyful. there's a sense of pride and on the pragmatic level, you never know when someone will spot that. and intelligent people who perform at the level of high excellence look for others. who do you say? and it radiates some kind of signal. it's weird. it's weird what you attract to yourself when you just focus on mastery and pursuing excellence in something. this is the cool thing about it. that's the joy i've really truly experienced. i didn't have to do much work. it's just cool people. i find myself in groups of cool people. really people who are excited about life, who are passionate about life. there's a fire in their eyes that's, at the end of the day just makes life fun. and then also money-wise, at least in this society, we're fortunate to where if you do that kind of thing, money will find a way. i have the great, i say this that i don't care about money. i have to think about what that means because some people criticize that idea as , yeah, that must be nice to say that. because i have for many periods of my life had very little money, but i think we live in a society where not caring about money, but just focusing on your passions. if you're truly pursuing excellence, whatever that is, money will find you. that's, i guess, the ideal of the capitalist system. and i think that the entrepreneurs i've studied and had the chance to get to know, and i'm sure you'd agree with this, they do what they do because they're passionate about the product. they're not just in it to make money. in fact, that's when they get into trouble. when they're just trying to make money. exactly. you said your grandmother, emily, had a big impact on your life. she lived to 102. what are some lessons she taught you? emily, who was the child of immigrants from russia and poland, who never went to college, her proudest day, i think, was when i went to college. she treated everyone with respect and tried to get to know everyone. she knew every bus driver in the town. she'd remember their birthdays. and one of the things she taught me is, no matter how high you fly, the lowest person close to the ground matters to you. and you treat them the same way you treat the billionaire at the top of the podium. and she did that. she didn't just say that. some people say that and don't do it. she really did that. and i always remember that it comes up in my mind at least once a week, because we're all busy doing a lot of things. and you either see or you even feel in yourself the desire to just, for the reasons of speed, to be short or not polite with someone who can't do anything to harm you right now. and i remember her saying to me, no, you don't, you treat everyone with respect. you treat the person you're on the phone with, customer service. you treat that person as if you're talking to jeff bezos or you're talking to elon musk. and i think making that a culture of who you are is so important. and people notice that. that's the other thing. and they notice when it's authentic. everyone's nice to the person at the bottom of the totem pole when you want to get ahead in the line for your driver's license. but are you nice to them when you don't need that? they notice that. and even when nobody's watching, that has a weird effect on you that's going to have a ripple effect. and people know that's the cool thing about the internet. i've come to believe that people see authenticity. they see when you're full of shit, when you're not. that's right. the other thing that emily taught me, and i think we've all had relatives who have taught us this, right? that you could be very uneducated. she was very uneducated. she had a high school diploma, but i think she was working in a delicatessen in new york while she was in high school, or maybe it was at gimbels or somebody. so she probably didn't take high school very seriously. she wasn't very well educated. she was very smart. and we can fall into a world where i'm a big believer in higher education and getting a phd and things of that sort, but where we think those are the only smart people. yeah. sometimes those are the people, because of their accomplishments, because of their egos are the ones who are least educated in the way of the world. yeah. least curious and not, ultimately wisdom comes from curiosity. and sometimes getting a phd can get away, can get in the way of curiosity as opposed to empower curiosity. let me ask from a historical perspective, you've studied some of human history. so maybe you have an insight about what's the meaning of life? why, do you ever ask when you look at history, the why? yeah, i do all the time. and i don't have an answer. it's the mystery that we can't answer. i do think what it means is what we make of it. there's no universal. every period i've studied, and i've studied a little bit of a lot of periods and a lot of a few periods, every period people struggle with this and there's no, they don't come to, wiser people than us don't come to a firm answer, except it's what you make of it. meaning is what you make of it. so think about what you want to care about and make that the meaning in your life. i wonder how that changes throughout human history, whether there's a constant. like that's, i often think, especially when you study evolutionary biology and you just see our origins from life and as it evolves, it's , it makes you wonder, it feels there's a thread that connects all of it, that we're headed somewhere. we're trying to actualize some greater purpose. like there seems to be a direction to this thing and we're all kind of stumbling in the dark trying to figure it out, but it feels we eventually will find an answer. i hope so, yeah, maybe. i mean, i do think we all want our families to do better. we are familial and family doesn't just mean biological family, you can have all kinds of ways you define family and community and i think we are moving slowly and in a very messy way toward a larger world community. to include all of biological life and eventually artificial life as well. so to expand the lesson to the advice that your grandmother taught you is i think we should treat robots and ai systems good as well, even if they're currently not very intelligent because one day they might be. right, right, i think that's exactly right and we should think through exactly as a humanist how i would approach that issue. we need to think through the kinds of behavior patterns we wanna establish with these new forms of life, artificial life for ourselves also to your point. so we behave the right way so we don't misuse this. we started talking about abraham lincoln, ended talking about robots. i think this is the perfect conversation, jeremy. this was a huge honor. i love austin, i love ut austin and i love the fact that you would agree to waste all your valuable time with me today. thank you so much for talking today. i can't imagine a better way to spend a friday afternoon. this was so much fun and i'm such a fan of your podcast and delighted to be a part of it. thank you. thanks for listening to this conversation with jeremy suri and thank you to element, monkpak, belcampo, four stigmatic and 8 sleep. check them out in the description to support this podcast. and now let me leave you with some words from franklin d. roosevelt, fdr. democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. the real safeguard of democracy therefore is education. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"the following is a conversation with eric weinstein, the third time we've spoken on this podcast. he is the wise turtle, master oogway to my kung fu panda, one of my favorite people to talk to in this world. a complicated and fascinating mind that i'm grateful to have the chance to accompany in exploring this world through conversation on this podcast and on his, the latter called the portal. quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. first is grammarly, a service i use in my writing to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and readability. second is sun basket, a meal delivery service i use to add healthy variety into my culinary life. third is semrush, the most advanced seo optimization tool i've ever come across. i don't looking at numbers, but somebody should. it helps you make good decisions. and finally, expressvpn, the vpn i've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet. please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. as a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me, i'm drawn to the possibility of having many more conversations with eric through the years. i think we have just the right kind of contrasting worldviews and a deep respect and appreciation of each other's life stories that creates for this magical experience in the realm of conversation that feels we're always looking for something that we never quite find, but are always better for having tried. i'm not sure how or why the universe is connected, eric, and me, but it did. and i would be a fool not to trust its judgment and enjoy the journey. if somehow you this podcast, please subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcast, follow on spotify, support on patreon, or connect with me on twitter at lex friedman. and now here's my conversation with eric weinstein. who's the greatest musician of all time, would you say? we were just off camera talking about eddie van halen. he unfortunately passed away. who's the greatest musician of all time? yeah. jonathan richmond. who's that? it's a weird question, so i'm gonna give you a weird answer. it's not because- thank you. okay, jonathan richmond, the reason i'm picking on him is that he had a quote. he was the front man of a group called the modern lovers. and his quote was something , 'we have to be prepared to play music. 'when our instruments are broken, 'the electricity's out and it's raining,' something that. and i thought that that quote was very interesting because what it said was, you have to be able to strip this thing down farther and farther back to get to something that is intrinsically musical. so we were having a conversation just now about virtuosity. and we're talking about eddie van halen and his recent passing. and that affected me emotionally. i don't know whether it affected you. i was never a van halen, the group fan, but i revered eddie van halen's capacity for innovation. i saw him , you know, rodney mullen, the skateboarder. i had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast just to talk about what it's to totally discontinuously innovate. and you posted a video of spanish fly, i think, and saying , i didn't know the guitar could make those kinds of sounds. like, what is this voodoo magic? what is it? well, this is the thing, right? the arpeggios that he did on a single string are so fast. and the attacks from the hammer-ons, when they go at light speed as he did, particularly, and the reason i chose that was is that i wanted to strip out the electronics because part of the claim will be is that he's a rock musician. and a lot of the innovations had to do with things peculiar to sort of the electrified setup. you know, his use of the whammy bar, for example, or the frankenstrat that he built from different pieces, right? all of those aspects, in my opinion, are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship. and that's why i chose spanish fly because everyone, of course, will go to something eruption or running with the devil, which is the first things that they heard that let them know that there was a new force erupting out of southern california that was eddie van halen, right? i mean, i'm in love with the story of it. you're often so poetic about music. like it clearly touches your soul on many levels. what is that? is it deeper than just rocking out with the in your convertible corvette 69? i imagine eric weinstein just driving down the california highways blasting some kind of music. is it just being able to be carefree for moments of time? or is there something more fundamental that connects the theory of everything in physics and life and all of that? how often do you have the chance, for example, to hear mathematics performed as you do in bach, right? like something with that kind of precision and elegance that can't really be grasped where, to go back to leonard cohen's famous line, the baffled king composing, right? such a good song. such a good song, but it's also individual verses of that song are insanely important. the baffled king is how we often make music. we don't really understand what did we just do that broke that person's heart sitting on the couch, right? and so it's a very strange thing that you should be able to have. think of it your computer. you've got this weird open music port, port 37.8, you know? like it's not even supposed to be there. and suddenly somebody starts playing guitar and they're making you feel things. or in particular, particular instruments the violin, it's so difficult, it's so unforgiving. and when it gives up its secrets, it just, it wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go. sometimes i talk about head, heart, and loins. when something can grab your head, heart, and your loins at the same moment and integrate them, there are very few opportunities to live that. and if you think about eddie van halen, you know, as far as your head, the musical innovations and the fact that he was drawing directly from the classical canon, you know, really speaks to the idea that maybe rock is what somebody jimi hendrix saw it as being, you know, an infinitely extensible medium. in terms of heart, i always noticed the smile on his face. it's painful to look at an eddie van halen solo, now, sometimes you'll see the cigarette dripping off the side of his mouth and you're , that's gonna fucking kill you. and i'm not even worried about it for you, i'm worried about it for me. you're gonna rob, i don't even need to hear you play another note. i just knowing that you're in the world, that there is somebody that everyone looks to, that nobody, i've never heard a guitarist say, eh, i don't know, i think he was okay. like, i've never heard it. you can hate him, but you still think he was a genius. there are very few people that in the world. and then loins, those leaps, that guy was incredibly good looking. and you know, skin tight pants, super athleticism. he completely owned the male sexuality of the stage, both being the completely dominant, you know, sort of mythical alpha male. i hate that expression, but there you are. but also this kind of little boy with this mischievous smirk and the sense that it all came together. how could you not eat that up? you could just imagine the millions of young teenage boys who are just playing air guitar in their room, just, yeah, basically dreaming of being that kind of god, the most perfect example of what a human being can be. yeah, it's fascinating to think. it is, and then as in many of the cases with these bands, you get these multiple talents in the same outfit. and i think that the original configuration with david lee roth, i mean, david lee roth is such a hot mess at all times. i would love you to talk to david lee roth. like if they, that dance would be just gorgeous. i don't know. he's- can you handle it? can you ride that? probably not. yeah. probably not because i think he's very, i get the feeling that he's very smart and very dysregulated. and i don't know that i could, bring him down to earth for a moment. well, i can also get pretty dysregulated, you know? and so i don't know whether it could be magic. it could be a shit show. i don't know what you thought of his appearance on rogan. that was an interesting one. i loved it, but joe and joe does this sometimes. sometimes he just sits back and listens and he just lets the music play, which works really well. i think you have a chance to kind of jump into the chaos. i care too. and then you'll just start, and the places you will go, you may not even talk about music for hours. it might just go to this, cause he i think lives in japan. like there's a weird- he's been in emt after he was a rock star. he chose to be kind of , i don't know. you know, it - there's depth to that man that hasn't been explored by him either. so that'll be an exciting conversation. can we go back to leonard cohen? yeah. can we just, the things i feel when i listen to hallelujah by leonard cohen or anything by him really, but that one- do you really want to get into it? let's go. what does that song mean to you? is it love? oh boy. well, first of all, it's mystery. like it starts off about mystery. so what are you doing? you're doing this alternation between the two chords. so three notes at the same time. one is called the tonic, or you have the major and the relative minor, and he's alternating between them. there's only one note of difference between those two chords. one of them would be feeling sad. one of them would be more joyous, typically described. and so by altering one note, it's the minimal amount to take you back and forth between joy and happiness as that's encoded in us. so he starts off with that. i heard there was this, david played the please the lord, but you don't really care for music, do you? that's really interesting because he's using this technique called bathos, right? so the alternation between the sublime and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right? so he's ... but there's a bitterness to it too. is it just play? well, the way i hear it, again, a great song allows for different interpretations. you happen to be asking me, so i'm gonna impart some stuff that probably isn't in the song, but why it speaks to me, and that's what makes it great. go there. the way i hear it is, he doesn't believe the audience. you don't really care for music, do you? then what are you doing listening to this, you stupid idiots? of course you care for music. you're too cool to care. so i see through you and screw you. that's the kind of, that's the energy i get out of it. then he does this weird thing. it goes this, is where he should put the description of where he is in the chord progression, which is the tonic, right? it goes this. and then he hits the fourth and the fifth, which are the two other major elements, the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony. so he's describing the chord progression in real time in the lyrics. there's two ways this can come about in other songs. like we had this example of, every time we say goodbye, do you know this song? every time we say goodbye. no, i think it was a cole porter maybe, or gershwin, maybe porter, i don't know. i cry a little, there is no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor. right, it's beautiful use of it. then there's times when it's duplicitous. so for example, you'll have, i guess my favorite examples of this are johnny cash's ring of fire. i fell into a burning ring of fire. then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune? i went down, down, down. he goes up, right? and so the idea is , , okay, that was a head fake. right, and another one of these, is nina simone's feeling good. oh, okay, so what do you get? birds flying high, you know how i feel. then sun up in the sky, you know how i feel. that woman's voice, she doesn't give a damn. and i feel it, but then what's the, da dum, da dum. it's heavy stripping music. it's, you're not in a good place. you're probably in some strip club with some shady. you're in the last of your money, you're drinking lousy beer, some bad situation, and she's feeling good. no, it's funereal, it's oppressive, right? i never thought of that song that way, wow. well, you think of it as joyous? yeah. no, no, no, if you think about it, contrast it with ray charles, for example. you know, do you know lonely avenue? well, my room has got two windows, but the sunshine never comes through. it's really depressed. it's the same sort of vibe as nina, but she's claiming that she's in great shape. so she's a good case of the unreliable narrator. leonard cohen, to me, is talking about the unreliable audience that's too cool to be with the performer on stage. there are things that go with the music, the cole porter stuff, that go against the johnny cash. i think these are the games that musicians play that the rest of us only sort of notice subliminally. okay, fourth, the fifth. and then he should say something about the relative minor or the, he's giving you the secret, the baffled king. in other words, he doesn't know why it works. did paco bell know why paco bell's canon would work? it was a discovery. that's the whole thing. like some music is discovered and some music is invented. and he's talking about a musical discovery. he's talking about the pythagorean power of the wave equation and then superimposed. like there's two genius intellectual concepts behind music. one of which is the wave equation. usually we solve it for a one dimensional medium because we're talking about strings or air columns. occasionally you're talking about things hand pans or steel drums or metallophones or gamelons, whatever. and those have a wave equation too that's much more chaotic. the other equation is this crazy thing that two to the 1912th is almost exactly equal to three which is what gave us even temperament. and so the tension between those two things is in fact one of these most beautiful stories. inside of that system, that formula of the baffled king is a discovery. it's not, he's not really composing it. the reason he's baffled, it's imagine that you took a little brush and you started brushing off a pyramid under the sands. you might think that you created the pyramid by your brushing, but in fact somebody else did it. that's why you're baffled, right? that's beautifully put, you're right. and as creating one of the greatest songs of all time and as he's doing it, he's baffled. and he's within the song. and he leonard is baffled is my contention but he knows enough to know that he's baffled, right? and so the idea is that he is composing. he has the audacity to compose as david. he's echoing david at a minimum. and then in a later song, which i really wish we would discuss, that's totally dystopic and you will not it at all is the future, which contains this line that i think i used in my episode with roger penrose on the portal. note the subtle plug, the portal, the portal, the portal. i'm the little jew that wrote the bible. so there is this way in which leonard cohen, i think, is constantly coming to the idea of being a biblical scribe. and i think this is one of the great things that, you see dylan doing this with all along the watch tower. you saw warren zevon, who we should talk much more about doing this with a song called, 'i was in the house when the house burned down. do you know this thing? no, this is embarrassing. sweetheart, this is a great day. warren zevon is one of the most important songwriters of our time and he's been largely forgotten by this generation. but bob dylan would sing one of his songs in tribute. i've heard bob dylan, very small number of songwriters really move him, woody guthrie, gordon lightfoot and warren zevon. by the way, bob dylan, if you're out there, appear on either one of our podcasts. we need to get your voice into a new medium for a new group. definitely. this is a time for bob dylan, my friend. honestly, you've been doing an amazing job in this space. one of the reasons i'm super excited to do this podcast again is that i've learned some things about what i don't do well. and i also have sort of struggled with the question, should i do those things better? because what if it's, you know, i always use the same example of the fitted sheet when you're trying to put a queen size fitted sheet on a king size mattress. he's , okay, i got that corner squared away and then you get another corner that pops off and they have to go back around. i wonder whether i can improve my style in the ways in which, you know, i think it was just a recognition of a difference. you do a better job of getting to the soul of a really top intellectual guest and making them accessible and presenting them as themselves for a huge number of people. and i'd give my eye tooth to be able to do that. do you ever think about this? like, cause i think about what is the greatest conversation i'll ever have. you know, in a sense of the portal, not to reduce it to anything, but there will be the greatest conversation. you may have already had it, but it's very possible. if enough people me can keep twisting your arm to keep doing the portal, please, that is there'll be an amazing conversation. one of the questions that i ask myself is , who is the person that i'm especially equipped, for some reason i'm convinced on putin. there's something in my head that says, i can do this man better than anyone else in this world. i got this thought in my head about it. i don't know why, and i'm convinced, but i think the universe works in that way. like if it tells you, it's gonna happen. the way i would say it is, is that almost everybody who becomes a supreme court justice believes at a very early age, they're going to become a supreme court justice. many people believe at an early age that they can do it, don't get there. but of those who get there, almost all of them had this sort of, well, i call it pathological self-confidence. and i do think you have pathological self-confidence, and you also have humility. and most people would hear those as a contradiction. i think that you would not be able to get away with what you do, if you didn't have the humility. and so i think the great danger is that your equation becomes unbalanced. that you either lose the humility, or you lose the humility overwhelms the ego and the drive, because right now you've got a mexican standoff in your mind, and the rest of us are just benefiting. that's beautifully put. my mexican standoffs aren't as stable as yours. all reservoir dogs all the time. but actually the person who that describes is peter thiel. peter thiel thinks more different. people always say, what does peter think about x, y, z, p, and q? it's , well, do you want communist peter? do you want hyper-capitalist peter? oh my god, right? on everything. that's why he's successful, is that he's got all these minds fighting each other. and so when people say peter is this or peter is that, i just laugh, because nobody who knows him would describe him as having thoughts at the level that people are claiming. and i do think that in my case, there's also pathological epistemic humility. like just, i know how little i can do in one life. i know how many things i've screwed up. i know how many things i've got wrong. and on the other hand, i know that if not, it's hillel's questions, if i'm not for myself, who will be for me? if i'm only for myself, what am i, if not now when? at some level, there's a question about if i don't decide that someone is capable and that somebody is me, if i apply that to everyone else on the planet, then nobody's gonna do anything. and so i do think that one of the things that people you and i get is, who are you to say that? f that, man. just sign me up for some dunning-kruger. yeah, but it's multiple minds you said. like this morning, i was feeling so good and confident about i couldn't think no wrong. and i remember last night clearly thinking that i'm the dumbest human who's ever lived and nothing i've ever said is worth anything. what the fuck am i doing with my life? why am i scared? i was terrified of this conversation. who the hell am i? this conversation? because i'm an idiot. but no, no, no, but this morning, i was the baddest motherfucker who's ever walked this earth. so i was very conscious. i think it was the coffee, i'm not sure. maybe some sleep. this sounds very russian and it involves multiple beverages, some of them being alcoholic, others containing caffeine. there's in fact, i can't share the story behind it, but there is a bottle of vodka in the fridge. okay. so i mean, i should have hit you for coffee because this is a morning show here. so i put out a call that we get a chance to have this conversation and people ask these wonderful questions. a few people asked about depression and suicide. so this is a russian program, so we'll have to go there. and i think about leonard cohen and one of the things that always kind of broke my heart and kind of suffocated the hope i have for just, i don't know, for love in a person's life is to hear how much depression was a part of leonard cohen's life and how much he suffered. i guess one way, i'm not sure where we can go with this question, but do you think about the places that the mind can go, these dark places? yeah. is there something, where the only escape out is suicide, for example, that's the darkest version of it? that, i really think suicide is a big place in suicidal ideation and self-harm and we don't talk a lot about it. it's a similar problem to trying to talk about trans. these are umbrella categories and if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves, but we don't know whether that's coming because of a problem in brain chemistry, because of an event in their life, whether evolutionary programming for suicide is weirdly normal, whether or not it might have a religious motivation. there's too many different forms of self-harm. it's something the 10th largest killer thereabouts. and i think that you can look at it from different angles. i'm old enough to have had pete seeger come to my college when i was at university and to watch his good humor in the face of all adversity. i think of odetta, i used to go to odetta concerts. i don't know if you know who she is. okay, this is gonna be one of the better days of your life. check out odetta when we're done with the interview. she was a civil rights figure, but also just had a profound voice and great musicianship. these people were in the struggle, right? and they saw lots of bad things happen and they kept their humor about them. and the thing is that you can take on the weltschmerz, the pain of the planet, or you can try to do something else, which is to be a happy warrior, even if the odds are terrible and the cost of failure is catastrophic. so even when surrounded by darkness. but the thing is with leonard cohen is he created such beautiful music. and yet it's anthony bourdain, the same. and yet they go to this dark place. and it could be, it's easier to say it's just biochemistry. there's a linkage between this highly generative, creative side. and in some cases, dark depression. in other cases, not. so you can't say that it's tied. the genius and madness are always, you know, co-traveling or the beauty and pain are one in the same. what you can say is that there's a cluster of people that tell you that for that cluster, there is a relationship between the darkness and the beauty. and i do think that in part, it's squaring circles that can't be squared. you know, that, well, we were just talking before about the inability to serve two perfect systems, the perfect system of the wave equation and the perfect system of even temperament. they're both perfect. they're not compatible. and once you realize that there is perfection and an inability to make contact with perfection, i think, you know, you recognize that there is no solution to this world. yeah. that's weird with the poets and musicians that you want to say, this is a particular thing that you do, but then there's spanish fly by van halen. and then you realize, . well, what do you get out of spanish fly by eddie van halen? i think it's very singular because of the fact that it's purely acoustic. for some reason, i always, i couldn't imagine eddie van halen separate from the band in front of thousands of people, just screaming and rocking out with lights everywhere. and spanish fly made me think , it made me imagine him sitting alone on a couch in a room. i think that's who he is. he's a great musician. he's sitting alone on a couch in a room. i think that's who he was. i really do. i mean, believe me, i get it. he was a rock star, he was a rock god. got it, got it, got it, got it. i'm almost positive that you can't get to where he got to without being a complete introvert. yeah, it made me imagine that there's some half naked supermodel walking around hoping that they can, you know, do their thing together. and eddie's completely disinterested. he'd be with the guitar. he'd be with the guitar, right? yeah. because , honestly, at some level, in one case, you know, maybe you're conquesting, maybe you're pursuing love and romance. in the other case, you're talking about a relationship to the order, the creator, the almighty, whatever it is you wanna call that substrate that is reality. and, you know, do i believe that eddie van halen and jimi hendrix and paganini and heifetz jacked into the true essence of the world? yeah, they did. i don't think it's as good as differential geometry. i'm sorry. i do think it's amazing for other reasons. and thank god, because it's very difficult to communicate differential geometry at scale. but the thing about eruption, for example, what level do you wanna come into eruption? do you want just the sheer majesty and pageantry? do you want the theatrics? like you could put him on wires and set his pants on fire or whatever. and, you know, it'd be totally in keeping with it. on the other hand, you want to have something completely precise that, you know, shows off the virtuosity of what's possible with the stratocaster. everything works, multi-axis. but there's a precision to it, which is very different than hendrix. there's a messiness to hendrix that, to me, somebody who has ocd has always been struggling. how does hendrix affect you? i mean, let's have the jimi hendrix conversation. i don't know that we can do anything to it that hasn't already been done to it. maybe that's not true. maybe the idea is that every generation has to have its hendrix conversation, and this is a long-form pocket. it's jimi hendrix experience, yeah. it's so funny. i hear he stole it from joe rogan. yeah. there's so many details. one, it hurt my soul on so many levels that you can put a thumb over the guitar to play a note, to hold the note. because i want it to be the russian virtuoso that sits with his classical guitar in perfect form, plays really fast with the fingers, and then you want the thumb to be perfectly relaxed and supporting the neck. so that's the russian conservatory student. conservatory student, yeah. then there's the russian wild man. which one is that? well, they're different russian archetypes, right? so the completely idiosyncratic russian is very different in a weird way from the, i can do this backwards in any key in my sleep and in any time signature that you, just snap your fingers. we've discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes. no, no, that was offline conversation. you told me the story. i should tell you the story. you should retell the story. there i was in darkest manhattan with the world's shittiest, it wasn't even an upright, it was a spinet piano. a friend had given it to me. the piano fell out of tune and i would have to tune it. and the only tuner i knew was this russian guy and i hated dealing with him. there was something about his attitude that just really rode me the wrong way. so anyway, my wife says, tune that thing. so we get the piano tuner to come and he's tuning this. he's , are you sure you want to tune this piece of shit? you know, okay, fine. so he's , okay, it's your money. the phone rings and i have the phone ringer set on a landline to paganini caprice 24. and immediately as the phone rings, he figures out what key the phone ringer is and which is not the key that list composed the variations on caprice 24. and he starts going into theme and variations on caprice 24 at some level i've never heard before. just jaw dropping it. and the phone stops ringing and we have this awkward silence. i said, i didn't know you were such a great piano player. and then he says one of these things that in russian accent in english hurts in a way you can't imagine. he said, no, you are the piano player. i am merely the piano tuner. and it's just , man, through the heart. you know, it's kind of reminiscent. i'd love to hear actually your opinion. this is reminiscent of the goodwill hunting story. what do you think about that? that movie? that movie. it's about it. it's mit. yeah. i guess when i think of that film, i think about matt damon as a young guy, risking everything, giving up harvard. i think, you know, probably the most accomplished group of people in the world are people who choose to give up harvard voluntarily. beautiful. right? that's true. bigger than harvard. i think, you know, ives was one of these people. bill gates, of course. and then oddly, you know. zuckerberg. what? zuckerberg. but then steve jobs gave up a read and read is the weirdest, craziest college in the world. people should pay much more attention to read. and i'm sorry, it's going through a hard time at the moment, but what it was before the current craziness is really an interesting story. irregardless, as we say in the 617 area code, i think that a lot of my reaction is to the real story of matt damon having this vision and being the young guy to pull it off. and, you know, i also think about robin williams trying to explore heart through this lens of acting. and, you know, as you and i, you've hung out with comedians, they know that they are a screwed up bunch of people. they do. they're proud about it. they really are. the idea that robin williams, who i saw many years ago when i was in la in the comedy clubs around here, you know, he was a straight up crazy dysregulated genius in tremendous pain and his desire to do it earnestly through acting rather than constantly by just sniping, you know, or being a clown or showing us how fast his mind worked relative to ours. i was really moved by that. i thought that he brought some authenticity and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that real. and again, you said, it doesn't always have to be, but in that case, the madness and the genius were neighbors. that one couldn't have been any other way. yeah. no, because his mind, the thing about seeing him in a comedy club was that he would react to random stimulus in the environment. you know, it could be a heckler. sometimes you almost got the feeling that he wanted a heckler because it gave him something to play against, right? he was infinitely instantly inventive. but i actually, to me, the best robin williams is as he got closer and closer to the end of his life, because there was a sadness and he's almost fighting the sadness with this improvisational, the weapons he has is this wit and humor and this dancing that he does with language. and then sometimes when you just fall silent, you can see the sadness. and i don't know, there's something so beautiful about that. it's this bird with a broken wing that's trying to fly, you know, and it's getting older and older. i mean, those, he would have made a one hell of a podcast, i'll tell you that. that's a sad... yeah, i have some sadness that i really do think that part of what we call podcasting is actually just getting to know a soul over and over again. like maybe the idea is that this is talking about depression and sadness and heavy feelings is not an american specialty. seeing that in context with the beauty of life is a russian specialty. like it is very much... sounds a dining menu. what? yeah. you want the russian specialty? a big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression. i do think that we're in a really terrifying and depressing time. and i think that part of it is that we don't know if something huge is about to get started. and we don't even know what this is. i mean, we just sit here in this weird world is falling into some new state and we're not even super curious. it's , what the hell just happened? everybody's got an answer. and i'm positive that all of those answers are wrong. let's try to at least sneak up on the good answer. so the central core of the answer is that the us seemed to be the greatest thing in the world in large measure because we hadn't noticed that we were getting a benefit from having no plan, not having to make a plan for low growth. as long as we had growth, we were in great shape. let's imagine that there was a... you could run an experiment. you have a billion copies of earth and you start the initial conditions slightly different. on some giant number of planets, a lot of the things that were discovered from the 1800s through the end of the 20th century are discovered in a period of time because a lot of that just has to do with once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments, you can see more. and the more you can see, the more you can make use of what you can see. and it turns out there was lots of stuff to do with , germs or electron orbitals or spectrum, electromagnetic spectrum. and so we got to do all of those things. and the us roughly corresponded for a good chunk of its history with this bonanza. and so of course we look an amazing genius country. we have no plan. imagine that you could sell a car. you don't have to put in seat belts. you don't have to put in airbags. you don't have to put in rear view mirrors or sensors or rear view mirror. you could save a lot of money on a car by not putting in all of the stuff to keep things from going wrong. and i think that's what we had. we had a machine that as long as growth was insanely good, we plowed it back, the riches and spoils and treasure back into the system and made more genius stuff. and we carried along a good chunk of humanity, hundreds of millions of people. we did not have a plan for what happens when the growth goes below the stall speed of our society. how confident should we be that the growth has slowed in a way that is permanent rather than a kind of slap in the face where- it's not the right concept. right concept is, i try to use the same words over and over again in case people see mold because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere. so i use this analogy of the orchard because everyone talks about low-hanging fruit. they know the concept of low-hanging fruit, but they don't think in terms of orchards. so they say things , you think we've picked all the low-hanging fruit, but i believe in the infinite inventiveness of the human mind. yeah. okay, that doesn't even work as an analogy. what if the idea is we only picked all the low-hanging fruit here, and then we're having this stupid argument about low-hanging fruit, and we're not going and looking for new orchards. we're not planting new orchards, we're not looking for forests, we're just sitting here arguing about low-hanging fruit. so my claim is there's probably a lot more low-hanging fruit and it's not here. it's in other orchards. it's in other orchards. one of those turned out to be the digital orchard. the digital orchard has not been as stagnant as lots of these other, the chemical orchard. i have faith that there's a small percentage of the population, but not zero, that's looking for those other orchards. like i'm excited about one of those orchards, which is, i believe there'll be robots in everybody's homes and that will unlock some totally new thing. totally new set of technologies, ideas, the way we live life, the productivity, all the, everything, it'll change everything. so i'm excited about that orchard. so i'm sitting, you know, i'm roaming that orchard and wondering how the hell you kind of bring back, the ant that finds a new source of food. i'm trying to find an apple i can bring back to the restaurant. great, so you're in an explorer idiom. and do you have faith that there's enough of those? i don't think there are very many of us. i mean, i'm one of them too. how many does it take? it takes one ant. it takes one ant. what are you talking about? how many elons does it take to screw in a light bulb? okay, let's imagine that we went, imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food, right? and then it comes back to the colony and it says, hey, i think i found a new source of food. and their initial reaction is, you're not authorized to find new food. what? why would you try to go find new food? we're gonna remove you from twitter. yeah, and by the way, i think the fact that you think you're allowed to go find new shows how privileged you are as an ant. get out of the colony, kill him, kill him. well, that's probably not a great model for finding new orchards. and i think that what we find is that where there's a system that allows somebody to ascend without a lot of gatekeeping, you can have that. but i saw this happen in hedge funds. hedge funds for a while hoovered up a lot of talent because they were places that had funding and had freedom. and in general, really smart people want to be free and they don't wanna think a lot about how they're gonna feed themselves. they wanna get lost in their minds. so you can either give them productive places to play, dangerous places to play. they're either gonna break into computers or find vaccines for you or build bombs or build companies. and we're not providing for the people who have to disrupt and have to innovate and trying to channel that effort. we're so focused on this other thing, which is fairness and safety. and fairness and safety, by the way, are really important. i don't wanna denigrate them. but the singular focus on fairness and safety without in the same breath being focused on growth and discovery and creation is gonna doom us because what we're talking about is we're always talking about divvying up the pie that is as opposed to the pie that will be. imagine that you spent all your time trying to divvy up the 13th century pie and you destroyed your ability to get to the 20th century. you'd be an idiot. but one place i think i disagree with you is i don't think you need that many people to empower the geniuses, the innovators, the people who refuse to spend most of their days in meetings about fairness. this is good. let's have a disagreement. i think podcasts and whatever you call that medium, it's just one little example of a tool that you can give power to. like you and your podcast can have the next elon musk and make him a star. now i see where you're going. okay. there has been a series of places for people to play and be free and we've lost them successively. what's a good place you remember? because i disagree with you there too. i think they're still there. you can still play. you interviewed noam chomsky. yes. okay. noam chomsky comes from an era. where you can play. where you could play. at mit. at mit. and you can't play. this is where i disagree with you. we've already had this. but. go check the clips channel for the lex friedman podcast. i think i wasn't brave enough at that time and i'm not really brave enough now. come on. because i don't. where's the vodka? it's a feeling and people are gonna tear me apart. oh, what are you and you speak from emotion and facts. the feeling. what podcast is this? it's yours. yes. tell the people who are currently editing your brain. because i saw that move right now. yeah. that they should go find another podcast. right? let's get rid of some of your audience right now. please go find another podcast if you're editing my brain. nevertheless, all the self doubt, they're sitting in that brain. so. oh my god, i can't stand to watch this. but all right. what is the self doubt loop that you're in? the thing is. when i walk the halls of mit. yeah. there's bureaucracy. there's administrators that never have done anything interesting in their entire lives. there's meetings. there's. all the usual crap. all the usual crap. but there's in the eyes of individuals. yeah. there's this glow of excitement. that has nothing to do with career. i understand this. and it's still a playground. there's little pockets of playgrounds from which genius can emerge still. and they're unaffected by diversity meetings or fairness meetings or blah blah blah. i love to hear that. yeah. well, you don't think so. i don't believe it. cause i've watched the change, lex. i've watched people edit. we are all editing ourselves all the time. i remember my old mind. i liked it better. all of this relentless focus on critical race theory and critical theory, postmodernism, fairness, social justice. it's making many of us into worse people. you think that's. do you think the matt damon's of the character is paying attention to any of that? you think that has an effect? have you seen what happened to matt damon himself? matt damon has tried to say various things at various times that seem to be relatively innocuous. he can't speak. okay. well, let's not mix up. matt damon is just an actor. well, no, no, no. he was just a harvard student who came up with his own genius screenplay, acted and made it happen. no. no, we're somewhere else. you don't think you can build the rocket company out of mit still? no, i do think. i think that there are things that you can still do, but we're losing them. we lose them. we keep losing them. i would say the biggest problem. here, let me just say , what i think the solution would be is to fire anybody who is doesn't , who's not faculty, especially young faculty should have way more power and administration should have much less power because right now the administration, which used some of the, who used to be faculty, but they've lost the fire, the spark that gave them, they've lost the memories of the playground. and so the people that admire and love the playground, you could see it in their behavior should have way more power. and so we should create a systems that give them power. i think all it takes- you're very idealistic. yeah. and you're very, you've got a huge heart. there's a weird time, cause i don't wanna dissuade you from believing beautiful things because i see how potent you are. you do all these things, jujitsu, guitar, podcasting, programming, computers, et cetera, et cetera. i don't think you're right. i think we're in a really deeply screwed up place where even the tiny number of, let me give you an alternate version of the dystopia. i do think that there are people who are capable and there's still places to play and cause things to happen that progress the story forward. but if you look at the fire that some of the people are in who fit that profile, how much crap has elon musk taken? quite considerable. right? and not much admiration from the- craig venter, jim watson. jim watson. these are very difficult people. steve jobs is a very difficult guy. yeah, it is a bit heartbreaking to me. i mean, everybody is different generations. i just, my mind is a little focused on elon musk because he's the modern person. well, you know him. i mean, he's a person to you. it hurts my heart to see how few faculty and people with nobel prizes and so on admire elon. like how little prob- he gets a lot of fans from people who buy his products and young minds just excited. but , why don't we as an institution, why doesn't mit say that we want to, somebody amongst us will be the next elon musk and we want to encourage them? like say that. say that in meetings, say that. like that's success. no kidding. for us as mit. and they, instead there's this jealousy. it's - well, here's the- did you hear what elon musk tweeted? did you see, how responsible is what he's doing? how, da da da da, just saying all these things that are just dripping with jealousy and basically- i want what he's got. that's the thing, right? and if you- here's the weird thing. rivalry has a different signature. you see, when you know that you're never gonna make it, that's the position you take. what is it in kung fu panda, which you've watched now? yes. what does tai lung say when he's looking for the dragon warrior and the furious five come to defeat him on the bridge? one of them gives up poe's name accidentally. and tai lung hears it. poe, so that is his name. finally, a worthy opponent. our battle will be legendary, right? he's excited. why is that? well, you learn about this in boxing. sometimes you'll see a division or an mma, which is lousy with talent. just you can't swing a cat without hitting an amazing, amazing athlete. sometimes you'll have a division which at that particular moment has one star and no real competition in that weight class or something. that person is in bad shape because you can't build a legend without the other. when you think of muhammad ali, what are the names that you immediately think of? you have to phrase your, you have to think of the other heavyweights. liston. right. yeah. and then you have to think of the other heavyweights. right. so those opponents are in part what made muhammad ali muhammad ali. and that's why the mayweather mcgregor revelation that, okay, this guy has got his opponent's picture in his house. how weird is that? well, because without the opponent, you may not be able to get there. now i am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries. you have examples in mind. well, there are rivalries where people take each other's credit and screw each other over. and then there are other rivalries the rna tie club where these guys were so in love with what they were doing that they couldn't wait to share everything. and nobel prizes were so abundant that, you know, most people got nobel prizes just for being a member of the rna tie club and doing cool stuff. and yeah, that's the golden, that's the golden kind of sweet spot. most of these people can't do what elon's doing because they can't break rules. they can't take the pressure. i'll tell you what really concerns me about your perspective. i think that there are a lot of genius ideas inside of people who don't have the stomach for conflict and derision. and i think a lot of those people are female. and i think that until we come up with a world in which we can swat down the trolls, where we can actually cause the trolls not to ruin everything. and i don't necessarily mean by shutting them up. i don't necessarily mean by being brutal to them, but somehow separating off people who are working and people who are trolling. i think that we're losing a huge amount of human genius in part because women in particular are not necessarily going to push an idea if it results in 10 years of being derided. very few men are willing to do that either. but there are some of us who are so dumb that we will pigheadedly stick to an idea for 10 years, even if the world collapses. i don't think that there are as many women who are going to make that calculation, even if they know the idea is correct. and one of the things that i believe technology can help us fight the trolls of all definitions of troll. like i believe that a better twitter can be built. interesting, i do not. i don't believe that a twitter successor can be built that solves most of the problems. i think you can always improve what we have, but i don't think that converges in something that really works. because i think ultimately the problem isn't twitter, the problem is us. for example, i've recently made a very disturbing realization, which is academics and trolls have very many similar behaviors. absolutely. it's largely a trolling community. i tend to believe that the trolls are not, it's the peter thiel mini mind idea, which in all of the trolls, there's the possibility of goodness. and all you have to do, not all you have to do, what you have to do is create technology that incentivizes them to embrace, to discover, to embrace, to practice the better angels of their nature. and i believe that, the people actually want to do that. the trolls is a short-term dopamine rush of childish toxicity that all of us want to overcome. i believe that deep within, we want to overcome that. i try to keep myself from believing what you believe. because you'd be disappointed if it's not true. because it's dangerous, because a lot of these people are implacable foes and there aren't many of them, but when you meet somebody who's , yeah, i just screwing people up. i'm here for the pain. i just believe even in them, there's a good- there's a wonderful book that i'm gonna recommend to you, where i hope this comes from. maybe i've got the source wrong, but in any event, it's a great book called maximum city about bombay. and i believe the conceit is that the author leaves bombay as a kid and comes back as an adult and he realizes he has to rediscover the city because he can't live in the city he left. so he gets in contact with all of the weird areas of the city and one of them is the underworld. he hangs out with the police, but in the underworld, he's talking to contract killers. and he says, you know, it's really weird. everybody pleads for their life right before i kill them. and they always say this thing about, i've got two kids at home. he says, never say that to a contract killer because we have terrible relationships with our parents. doesn't it dare us to? and i was just thinking , , wow. so there's a minus sign in front of that statement. you're sitting there saying, you know, i've got a three-year-old, it's , okay, well, i'm gonna take this pos out of that kid's life. maybe i'll have a chance. you don't know how people are wired. and as much as i hate to say it, there are people whose wiring is so disturbing and so different from yours that you will never guess why you can't reach them or how much pleasure they may have gotten because they may have gone over a point of no return. nevertheless, you are just a smart guy who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis. you do not know this for sure. no. and i am an, you know, whatever the hell i am, that has a different hypothesis that even in the darkest human beings that seem to be only full of evil, there's a good person there that could be discovered. and that's one of the reasons i love doing your show is that you have these beliefs, even as a russian. the russian special. as you know, the russian, there is a weirdness, which is a total cynicism and total idealism locked together, right? that's very much a part of the russian character. the reason i was kept bothering you, kept bothering you to have this conversation is i'm really worried about the next couple of months. no kidding. and if there's anybody in this world that could help alleviate my worry by at least walking along with me through this worry of mine, it's you. do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war, some kind of division that explodes beyond just stuff on twitter, but something that's really destructive to the fabric of our society? well, i believe we're in a revolution, as you know. i've called it the no-name revolution or n squared revolution. i've been talking about it for years. i don't think, i think waiting for this to be called a civil war is not smart. only history will call it such, fine. but i think that the problem is, is that you're encountering things that you've never seen, trying to fit them into things that you already know. right. and. but history repeats itself. yes. ish. you don't see lessons from history. i do. we see today. but i don't see it repeating itself. you know, the famous quote is that it rhymes. it rhymes. i mean, the thing i guess i'm speaking to is violence. and. we're in there. the abstraction of violence. imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class. okay. thank you for speaking to the audience. trying to lose these people. come with me. go on. no, no, no. i've dealt with your audience and your audience contains the smartest people around. i guarantee you if i say some stuff, first of all, any wrong thing that i'll say, they're gonna detail. so that'll be a little bit of catnip to bring in the smart people. but they'll also digest it for each other. it's one of the great lessons of long form podcasting. if you don't waste all your time explaining things, that's the job of the audience to do amongst themselves. they're happy doing the work and those who aren't, they leave. isn't that great? they'll leave. the people who don't wanna struggle will leave. you can get rid of them. i think that the point is you would want to say violence is defined relative to a context. so let's call it meta violence so that we don't get into the problem we already have a term for physical violence. so we have meta violence and physical violence. i would say that physical violence is subclassed from meta violence. meta violence is the disruption of a system. it's sort of, it's a, for example, if a cell dies, you can die through apoptosis or necrosis. apoptosis is controlled programmed cell death. necrosis is just , okay, this didn't work. that was a violent disruption of the system. and this meta class is presumed in the documentation. is it all negative? no, what are you talking about? so this is part of the problem in the madness of our age, right? which is if you open up a drawer in your cabinet, right? in your kitchen and you see knives, spoons and forks. do you have a sense that the spoons are good utensils and the knives or forks are bad utensils because they're mean? i mean, if you start thinking in these terms, that knife is there to do violence. that's violence you want done, right? when i cut a mango, i'm doing violence to the mango. the mango expects that i will do violence to it because otherwise i won't be able to get the meat and it won't get its seed spread somewhere else. so in part, violence is absolutely part of our story. so, okay, so there's this meta violence class. yeah. and what's- so the meta violence class is already, it's a multiple inheritance pattern. whatever's going on right now inherits from meta violence. no, but there's certain subclasses that allow evil to emerge. so what i'm specifically worried about is that- what's on your mind, lex? what's really going on? okay. i worry that amidst the chaos of these protests or the chaos that could be created by the feeling that the election does not represent the voice of the people, saying that whoever gets quote unquote wins the election according to some kind of reporting of the numbers that come out, that's not going to represent what people actually want, people actually want to be the leader. like something in that narrative will create so much division that people will resort to literal violence protests that really, that the united states loses its united aspect. and because of that, because of that chaos and tension, evil people, evil forces, that my definition of evil is just cruel human beings use that moment to attain power, the kind of power that ultimately goes against the ideal of the united states. that could be donald trump, that could be another human being, it doesn't really matter. my worry is that love doesn't win out in this, the unity doesn't win out in this. and i feel you and i have responsibility, small. yeah, i know. and so how do we let love win in this moment of- we're gonna have to fight for it. you're gonna have to become a fighter. you're gonna have to throw some serious punches if that's what you want. you have to be muhammad ali here because the moment you start criticizing anything, people, you have to be a masterful communicator because- that's why you're here. look, lex, in part, your decency is allowing you to do things that you couldn't otherwise do. i saw that you had michael malice on your podcast. yeah. now michael malice is, i think of somebody who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful, yes? he's also got this trolling game, which he's quite open about and you talk to him about it, which i can't stand. and this is the idea, , grandpa doesn't get the internet. well, i'm grandpa, i don't get the internet. i don't love the trolling. yeah. i don't see any of the modern trolls as being that kind of genius level trolling the people who deserve it in the way that they deserve it. right now, what i see is that anything that stands up gets cut down. yeah. it's anything earnest. you have to turn into cynicism and a meme. and it's this idea that the people who believe that the world is chaos and has no point are constantly trying to, and i think that's the way it is, no point are constantly trying to let you know, don't try to use the internet for meaning, for decency, for goodness, because we are going to find out that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy and we will make you suffer. so i do think that there's a lot of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world, some of it mine, some of it yours, but we all have it. and the trolls somewhat remove that, but it's not a judicious, kind, constructive, compassionate, caring version most of the time. and a lot of those trolls, i have this feeling about michael malice, i don't know whether it's right, that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath it and that that's motivating some of the trolling behavior. and you and i don't seem to be doing that. i don't see you as almost ever trolling. yeah, you and i are, i'm very much against trolling. i'm very much against trolling. it doesn't mean that it's selective. you know, i'm not even, it's not even true. like everything we say, we say , i'm for it, i'm against it. this isn't my native language. i speak nuance. i don't speak this internet shit. and the more i have to communicate through internet shit, right, i almost never take a tweet seriously if it contains the letters lmao, lol, rtfol. there's an interesting effect where people say stuff and then finish with lol. you put it beautifully that it indicates to me that this is a person, we've talked about why i wear the stupid suit. yeah. is , this is anti, this is to fight the lol at the end of sentences. it's take, it's stand up for the words you're saying. yeah. don't finish stuff with lol, removing completely the responsibility of the content of the sentence that preceded it. yeah, also choosing the outfit that worked both for men in black and the blues brothers, not a terrible choice. okay, but getting back, look, lex, we're not in a position to do this. you need to be seated in a different chair. your chair is the wrong chair. you're in the wrong chair. it's been so long. all right, i wanna talk about you and joe biden. joe biden was a 29 year old guy with nothing particular going on so far as i can tell. okay. i know people as impressive at age 29 as joe biden, 12 rows back, three deep, doesn't matter. huge number of people. none of them my age can get to where he got to. like we're all morons. anytime somebody takes out, if you found eddie van halen in a guitar shop, you'd be angry. what is this guy doing repairing guitars? then somebody will say, maybe he loves to repair guitars. yeah, i mean, what is your russian piano tuner doing? what is my russian piano? that was the whole point of that story, which is what is it that happened in that life that converted somebody? and i find this, for example, with russian doctors who are technicians in offices now. there's a huge amount of talent in the world that's not sitting in its proper seat. yeah. and quite honestly, i've gotten to the point where my feeling is we've got to take the seats. right. maybe we don't sit in them. maybe the idea is that we take the seats and we put some smart gen z person in the seat and say, look, no chanting. i don't want to hear you say, no justice, no peace. if there aren't verbs, if it rhymes, it's wrong. like i used to have this thing, if it rhymed, things that rhyme are more true. but in general, if something starts at one, two, three, four, i don't want to hear what the rest of your sentence is. yeah. but i feel the responsibility that you carry, that i carry, this is where joe rogan generally removes himself from being, i'm just a comedian. this idea of i'm just a comedian. we all do that. but at this moment in history, history literally can pivot on the words of a tattooed, ripped 50 year old comedian. and i think the same is true with you. okay, well, i'm interested and i care. speaking of lyrics, there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke. that's not us. that's not us. the hour is getting late. that's not us. in the song, the joker and the thief are on opposite sides of jesus having this conversation over jesus. you and i, we've been through that. that's not our fate. that's somebody else's fate to throw spitballs at the internet. that's not your fate. you're an earnest guy. you're filled with love. you're getting the most amazing podcast guests. but you can win over the internet. this is the point i'm trying to make, that you're saying i'm just a grandpa. i don't know the internet. i'm telling you you're gonna get bigger and then you're gonna get cut down. you're gonna keep ascending for a while, lex. and then you're saying, and naturally there's a- i'm telling you, i watch the same process. people get up to a certain level and one of the things that's going on in my opinion with joe rogan is that when joe rogan starts to talk about his misgivings about joe biden, in a way that you find at any bar in america, about cognitive decline, and a 77-year-old who's about to be 78, to believe in november, we have never had anything remotely as insane as a 78-year-old person slated to win the white house. and you're saying when that idea is being communicated, is there something that's about the disc concept that you talk about the system naturally starts to- some bad thing happens to joe or one of joe's close associates. the ability to destroy people who become inconvenient has been documented. this is what we have done in the past. whether we are doing it now, we don't know because we are not doing this church committee too. in order to know whether or not you are currently destroying american citizens, as we did in the past and as we have documented, and as we found out in 1976, the federal government destroyed americans who had political beliefs that the government didn't want to continue. and i don't know whether you are grasping that one interpretation of why john stewart and why joe rogan and why bill maher and all these people to some extent hide behind. it's a joke. yeah. it's because they're trying to find a protected class. is there someplace i can stand and speak the truth which does not result in my being garbage collected? interesting. i guess you're right. my intuition is you can stand as you gain more power, you can stand behind your force. there's a fight over joe rogan right now. i mean, i've talked about it for a few years now. people did not understand how big that program was. people didn't understand long-form podcasting. i was derided by people who i think of as being very shrewd for believing in these podcasts as a major force. and most of the people who derided me have said, wow, did i not get things? it's if you started to propose, you wanted to do the sopranos in the era of 30-minute sitcoms. like, you don't get it, man. the american people, they're not interested in these long plot storylines. that's your weird thing? nobody cares, dude. everybody just wants short, fast, memorable. and , okay, so if you do that, you totally miss the opportunity. and the savvy people used to say, kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dunce and nobody ever lost a dime underestimating the intelligence of the american people. well, that was totally wrong because they didn't calculate opportunity costs. i have been talking about the problem of joe for a long time. the problem is, is that when the system wakes up, they're gonna wanna control it. and they come up with new different mechanisms of doing that. i guess one interesting one is cancel culture. well, look at the number of people around joe who they've come after since they realized that joe was really big. joey diaz, brian callan, chris d'elia. now, i'm not saying that those are all related, but i do notice that there are at least correlations between when joe says something and when something bad happens in joe's universe. it's easier for me to believe that that's happening when it's happening around joe himself. but i'm worried about my friend. i don't necessarily wanna push him towards being more if he doesn't want it because i don't think, i don't wanna conscript people. he's got a great life, he's got a great situation, he's done a huge service. thank god, do you know, , how much do i owe joe just for what he's done for you to say nothing of what he's done for me or for brett or for sam or any of these people? and i'd to think that we all try to give back, but i'm worried about joe. he's not worried. one of the inspiring things about joe is, i mean, he's in this war alone and the way he fights the war is by just enjoying life. well, that's his thing. as long as he stays close to things that he loves and being, one of the things, he's honest about his drug use. he loves to hunt. so he's just, he does a certain amount of semi-vice signaling up front. and then you just also know him. this is why every time they try to take him down, you use the n word, you know? it's , unfortunately, everybody knows who joe is and yes, he doesn't act as if he went to a fancy finishing school, right? that's not his energy. the fact that you've got some super smart guy who always pretends to be a meathead, just , you know, they're , hey, i'm a comedian. it's all these defenses and disguises. okay, you've got this super smart guy who he's admitted to most of the things that you can take him down for. and because everybody's been effectively in his den or his basement, think about that studio as his basement, people have hung out with joe so many hours that you can't tell them something about joe or they're gonna say, wow, i'm gonna believe the new york times and not the hundreds of hours i've spent on the joe rogan experience. but the cool thing is that this is what inspires me is that the way he's waging war against the system is just by being a good person and talking enough hours in a week where that message bleeds throughout the words and the gaps between. and that's so inspiring to me that the good people can win by just being good. and he's kind and he's tough and he also, he's no pushover. i always worry a little bit when i sit down in that chair. you still get scared that he'll call you on some kind of bullshit that you weren't even aware of? no, the first time i was on the show, the energy wasn't great between us. and it was in a sober october situation. so i think i hadn't understood that. and maybe our egos got a little bit off. i don't know. i mean, i was having fun, but maybe it was just two complicated life forms getting to know each other. the first one was probably, yeah, that made me a little nervous for the future. but then, joe and i have become friends, although sometimes we have miscommunications on yom kippur, i texted him and i said, joe, i wanna apologize for ways i've let you down as a friend that haven't been there for you and appreciate everything you've done for me. like i get this text back, , what the fuck is your problem? you're great, dude. i don't know what bad place you're in, but cheer up. it's , joe, don't you have any jews in your life that apologize for what they've done? he was just , dude, have you lost your mind? what the hell's gotten into you? yeah, what do you think about the spotify thing? what about it? ask me a question. he's now, as opposed to being just a comedian with a podcast, he now is just a comedian with a podcast who stepped in the middle of the center of cancel culture, which is , i know spotify is in sweden, but they represent silicon valley. they represent the very kind of structures they contain and represent the kind of structures that threaten to destroy the elans of the world. and he just stepped, with his alex jones and his joey diaz just strolled right into the middle of it. i think it's awesome. i love it. but do you think he's strong enough to, i don't know. i mean, i don't even know the right way to ask this, but is he strong enough to persevere? it's a bit interesting. it's when a lion decides, wow, that honey badger looks tasty. i'm gonna swallow it whole, see what happens. because i talked to him offline. he really seems to be willing to give away the 100 million, which gives him so much power. oh, i don't. it's a powerful thing to be able to say, yeah, to the honey badger. he just strolls in, but he's willing to walk away from anything in this world. well, he's gonna walk out the other side of the line. i don't think he's gonna go out the way he came in. yeah. well, you know what it is? it's tommy lee jones entering the bug. this is a giant alien, he just walks into it. he gets swallowed by the bug and he blasts out from the inside. i have it as tommy lee jones. yeah. that's joe rogan to you. yeah, is that my feeling is that spotify doesn't understand what they're messing with. i could be wrong, but i'm not. no, you're right. i'm right. because joe doesn't need anything, man. i mean, this is the weird thing about it. i'm sure that he loves all his toys, whatever, blah, blah, blah. he's a rich guy. yes, he's got f.u. money. he had f.u. money a long time ago. and you're not, you know, the other thing about it, it's a bit weird being friends with a dude that. it just is, because you call him up or he'll call you up and he's , what's going on in your life? i don't know, kind of depressed, trying to get some math done. what are you up? oh dude, i can cheer you up. i just came off of a 29,000 person stadium. it's , cool, how'd you do that? oh, i don't know, i just announced it on instagram a few days ago and it filled up. it's just , damn. yeah, so much love in that guy. that thing is so powerful. yeah, so there you go. i mean, you could be that too. the instant joe takes an interest in politics and saving the world. you might destroy all of that. it's going bye-bye, i promise you. i just disagree with you. okay. i mean, because you have to do it. like you've said this many times before. i'll bet you, i'll bet you a bottle of stoli that you can get, if you get joe rogan to get highly politically active and call out the system for all the bullshit that it is in a very pointed and determined fashion. and he doesn't get destroyed. i'll give you the vodka. the vodka? yeah. that sounds a pretty damn good deal. but you've said this, i mean. no living heroes, my friend. no living heroes. i just. no living heroes. it's just difficult. you just have to be good at it. i mean, if you just say generic political things. no, no. you're going to be taken down. the more heroic you are, the more beautiful you are, the more you will be made to suffer. and if they cannot get you on reputation, if jesus himself came down. i don't know if i ever read, i probably have never read to you the hit piece i did on jesus. you don't know about this? no, i did not know. i did hit pieces on all of the best people in the world. wow. so whoever it was who cured cancer, discovered new particles or whatever it is, i did a hit piece against them to prove that i can do it to anybody around anything at any time. except eddie van halen is what we're talking about. well, eddie van halen is now dead. but if this was a situation, you know, hot for teacher, canceled. disrespectful. absolutely. also, you know, packaging female objectification for young men. clearly eddie van halen is one of the worst people alive. but the skill, the incredible inspiration that is just radiating from his music inspires so many millions that they will fight those canceled pieces. they will fight those. so this is your thing. you have this idea that there's a war between good and evil and the good has already been designated the winner. and it's not true. but your belief that it's true. take it till you make it, no? i mean, you gotta, it's motivating both of us. like i also believe that we're gonna win because if i don't, then i can't get out of bed. it's pretty heavy at the moment. do you think 2021 can make us feel good about the trajectory of society? so where we emerge from this year, feeling good. like there's a smile on eric kwan's face and the next time we talk, we'll be doing some kind of duet on guitar and not having this worried look on our faces. no. okay, but you've also promised that you're going to somehow end this in a positive. okay, so how do you turn the no around? what's the u-turn from the no? until we get some actually decent people in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking about their next paycheck, i don't see a solution. let me just say what the prerequisites for a solution are and to let you know why i don't think it's coming. first of all, both of these political parties, the leadership of them is disgusting and has to go. they're tearing us apart. they lack the will to be americans. they don't understand the subtlety of the project. they're simply the people who figured out how to inhabit the seats and that is their great achievement. i believe that in order to solve this, you need people who can integrate, who are not partisan at the level of the partisan warriors that we're seeing. people who believe in dividing the pies of the future rather than the present pie as our main task as americans because we are built around growth. i'm sorry to say it. you need an ability to have subtle conversations and you need the ability to exclude. and at the moment, everyone knows inclusion is good, which it isn't. it's saying, well, water is good. if i say water is good, everybody will agree with me. it's not. people drown. people need to get dehydrated. it can be life saving or life ending. it isn't good or bad. inclusion is not good or bad. inclusion is just inclusion. exclusion is part of inclusion. we've taught people that they can reason through the world as sub, you know, cocker spaniels. they just bark things at each other. you know, i'm for safety. i'm for inclusion. i'm for growth. oh, really? do you guys use verbs? dependent clauses? are there compound complex sentences? where are we in this sea of nonsense? you have to be able to build a place where you have smart, talented people who represent a diverse group of correct opinions. you need to get rid of almost all of the people who have opinions that are antithetical to what we're trying to accomplish. you need to give them insulation, which we're terrified because we don't trust anybody. so everything has to be transparent. if you're going to the bathroom, i want those walls to be plexiglass so i can see what you're doing. it's , that's too much transparency. we have too much and not enough at the same time. and then, you know, in essence, you need to ensure that people aren't worried about feeding their family every four seconds for being real. none of that is happening. and our billionaires, our billionaires are pathetic. what is the point of billionaires if you're not going to do billionaire type cool stuff saying, f you, and i'm going to throw, you know, $3 billion at the project of restoring the national conversation? i don't grasp this. what is the point of creating obscene wealth if we don't have anyone smart enough and caring enough to use it? so i agree with that last part for sure. let me slightly push back on the idea that the leaders themselves are broken. i feel this goes to the joe rogan, joe biden and trump having a debate on that program. i feel joe biden has a lot of really interesting ideas that he's almost forgot how to communicate. he's been fake for so long within the system. hillary was fake for too long. i'm sure she had real ideas at the beginning that she still was campaigning on decades later. but if the system, if the platforms empowered you to search, to be honest, to be real, to search for those ideas within yourself, long form conversations do, then we, even the donald trump and joe biden leaders we have now would take this country to a better place that would unite people. so we can keep the current congress. we just need to create better platforms. it's my, this is going to the intuition that there's good in donald trump. there's depth and complexity and intelligence and the same with joe biden. there's good in joe biden. and it's just, we're not incentivizing. i mean, there's several things i think are broken. one of them is twitter. the other is journalism. it's just the platforms of us communicating with each other. one of the reasons that i try to come up with unifying explanations is that, if you look at the number of wildfires in california, let's say that we've just seen, if you treat them all as spontaneous, uncorrelated instances, it feels , my god, it's just whack-a-mole. every time i send a fire truck here, there's a fire over there. so you want to come up with something a central theory, which is why do i suddenly have a problem when i hadn't had a problem before? so i look for these unifying explanations. and i found one the other day that really speaks to me and people are very frustrated because they've been trained to think about this incorrectly in my opinion. but here's the graph that you need to look at. on the x axis is time by year. and on the y axis is something average age of a human. the title of the graph is any desirable situation involving institutions. so that could be ceo, it could be tenured professor, it could be who's getting grants, it could be the age at which people win nobel prizes. university presidents, all these things go up. in other words, for a long period of time, the average age of the person in a desirable situation has been increasing something nine months for every 12. those graphs have to go down at some point. the specter of having five people all born in the 1940s as the final entrance in the presidential context. that makes no sense. think about how bizarre a thing that nobody's even read or talking about. the last five people were all ancient by presidential standards. not one, not two, but five. we are talking about a contest between somebody who is the oldest of the baby boomers, the very beginning of the baby boom, summer of 46 birthday, fighting somebody who is in the silent generation. the silent generation guy in a town hall in florida gets this question from a gen z guy saying, what's going on with my future? joe biden has the audacity to say, i'm a transitional president, you guys are the highly educated one. when has any generation in history needed a transitional 78 year old person to take office? it's bizarre, it's preposterous. that graph is the graph we can't talk about. that graph is the graph of our destruction. because it has the, you can make a one line argument which is, sounds ageism, which isn't a very good argument. no, but what it does is, is it muddles the conversation. and you always have to ask yourself the question, if this conversation becomes muddled, who wins as a result of the muddling? well, it's a battle, but let's just win it. let's win the battle. you give- are you running? for sure, i'll run. i was born in russia, can't run. so, but we russians can hack elections, so we'll figure it out. this is me officially announcing my run for president. i was born in st. petersburg, florida. yeah. lex, what is it that you really wanna ask? i think, i wanna put some responsibility on the portal. the portal, the portal, the portal. that the portal gives power to the people in that graph. because you put it quite brilliantly that the people that move the world, their age has been going up. and not move the world, but put in the position where they get the chance to affect the world. these new platforms, i think twitter falls in them, give power to the younger people. it doesn't have to be about asian necessarily, but the younger thinking people. so, that's a promising thing. and you are , you're gandalf. you get to pick your frodo's, whatever. i'm not very good with the analogy, but the whole point is for you as gandalf- i don't know that i make that much sense. gandalf makes sense. i don't know if people know how to fit me into this ecosystem. i think there's something in my presentation that people find very confusing. no, figure it out. i disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror and think , what is it? is it, maybe you need a mustache. i don't know. but there's something about figuring out how to be a charismatic communicator in this. and that's the responsibility. you said finishing sentences with the lol is painful for your soul. that's just how somebody lets me know i don't have to take their opinion seriously. yeah, it's still the language, the way that people are communicating and you're swimming that wave. you have a big platform. i have a growing platform. it feels this is the place to give power. i agree, but we're gonna get swatted down. i just don't think so. you're wrong. why are you afraid of the big- because i've studied it. because i've studied- let me ask you a question, lex. i believe that every society is supposed to have a collection of what i call break glass in case of emergency people. yeah. these are people who are universally loved and trusted by your society. for example, david attenborough, the great british naturalist and presenter, recently came on instagram. he's worried about the planet. and i said, look, they're very, very, very, very few of these people left. let's pay attention, find out what he has to say. maybe he's gonna be an ass. maybe he's gonna be an idiot. maybe he's gonna say wrong things, don't know. tell me about your top 10 universal american heroes. this is not a rhetorical question. no. give me five. everybody looks to that person and says, yep, the best of us. i follow that person. oh, not divisive. well, everybody's an interesting concept. i mean, elon musk is very divisive, right? but i'm talking about overwhelmingly people would follow that person if that person gave a rousing, intelligent speech that said we must act now because we're in dire straits. i think a lot of people fall in that category. for me, it would be in the tech world, in the engineering world, elon musk. elon musk. elon musk. elon musk. the rock. i'm thinking who is the most eloquent actor. so you think celebrities, so people with platforms. i didn't say celebrities. they have to be well-known. i believe, yeah. this goes to joe rogan. first two did not really impress me as being what i said, but okay. elon several years ago would have. can you, can you try to? joe rogan has. why do they fail? why does, why does. lots of people treat joe rogan as if he's some sort of right wing racist because they've never watched his program. they don't know who his friends, i don't know. oh, but when i thought you said everybody, i thought you meant a large enough people where huge change can happen. not actually literally everybody. because i think. people who've pulled up people who've pulled off something where everybody's convinced that that person just deeply. i mean, i think i've told you the story before, but the one time i've seen the power of a figure this. i mean, very few times i've been in a large crowd and i've seen people just moved where they would do almost anything good, bad, indifferent because they were primed. one was a rolling stones concert. the other one was nelson mandela coming to boston. and man, you've never seen anything this. you check out the photos from the banks of the charles river when nelson mandela came. there are people that you need in your dark hours and we can't agree on who they are. and as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit. we get out the shit branch. yeah, i just disagree with you. so i think. what do we disagree about here? i think it doesn't matter who it is. i think really good speeches are needed. and i think a lot. i was gonna give them. i saw killer mike try to give a good speech. yeah, he did. well. in atlanta, right? yeah, he did. that was something. very impressed. yeah. even killer mike immediately gets into this. sell out. or , yeah, but he didn't take up the responsibility. i would say. he didn't. of going bigger. so he was speaking to the community. and he was doing what he. on this particular moment, he's exceptional at it. and he was speaking to this particular moment. he didn't take it a step farther, which is giving the same speech, but bigger than race. bigger than this particular moment, but more about the american project. you know the guy who landed the plane in the hudson? yes. yeah, there you go. that's a good example. sully. that guy, until we screw him up, is the kind of thing that i'm talking about. yeah, exactly. i mean, jaco, maybe. that's another. jaco's pretty good. jaco is pretty good. can't really tell. is he a democrat? is he a republican? i don't know. he's an american, that's for damn sure. yeah. and i think there's a lot of folks. and then, no, i think jaco, there aren't. that's one of the reasons why jaco is so important. yeah. your podcast, the portal, is something in my little universe is something a lot of people really love. and it moves them. they draw a lot of meaning from it. and also, especially in difficult times. it gives them a comfort through this kind of, it's not just nuance. even when you're talking about chaos, there's love underneath all of it. and i think people draw a lot of meaning from it, which is why they are wondering why you haven't been doing that many podcasts, or you haven't done it in maybe a month and a half or two months in this most difficult of times. is there a good reason? yeah, there are lots of good reasons. so the first one is kind of weird, which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous. and if you say, i don't wanna be famous, it's , , you're just saying that because you want everyone to think you're famous. you're not that famous. you know, okay. i don't love being as well known as i've become. there's lots of things that are fun about it. it's wonderful that you can go to, i can go to any city in the world and there are portal listeners there. all i need to do is put out a tweet and 20 people show up for a drink. and they're amazing people. and they're almost, i mean, you can see my live qas on my instagram page. if you go to eric r. weinstein, i just pick somebody randomly. i was really worried about it at first. and maybe i should be worried about it, but in general, people all over the world are just so positive. and so, you know. and thoughtful and deep in their story. because they're self-selected, right? yeah. but i don't the fame. the thing we just described comes with the fame. it's a beautiful thing. you don't, you're worried that it's getting. it's ephemeral. look, lex, it'll turn on you in a heartbeat. it'll turn on you in a heartbeat. yeah. it'll turn on you in a heartbeat. and the other problem is, i don't my audience being my audience. i wanna get closer to them. i wanna talk to them. i wanna find out what is this doing in your life? my house fills up with art that people send me. the lightest thing is an effects pedal called something , i don't know, it's a bow tie overdrive from a guy in mexico. right? yeah. you play lefty, by the way, in a tiny little tangent. do you play electric? i have a stratocaster. okay. but it doesn't have a strap and i don't know what to do with it and i have a bad amp. so you should hook me up with the. we'll find it a home maybe. okay. you're starting to sense that this is too much. no, i wanna be here. i wanna do the work. very simply. i don't have an ability to fully explain myself. i don't wanna claim that i don't love the fact that, how much love do we get from these programs? generically, people are incredibly generous. people have begged me, set up a patreon account and i haven't been able to do it. i should do it. i've said to everybody, it's a business, it's a business, it's a business. but they're so used to being defrauded when somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives. my goal was to say, i'm gonna keep talking to you about, you wanna know why i started doing ads on my show? was because i wanted people to think from the get-go, this is a business, this is what i sound when i'm selling. but you know, you see, i've lost weight. a lot of that is due to athletic greens. athletic greens. you know. code, what's the- i don't know what my promo code is for athletic greens. probably slash portal. but doesn't matter. just slash portal. but fitbit, who doesn't advertise, has also been instrumental, as well as a guy named steven cates, who was a fan from the show, found me on the street and just said, i'm a trainer, i wanna help train you. it's got me on a good path. so that's one paid advertiser and two people that i'm calling out just because, you know, two outfits, steven cates and fitbit, that have changed my life. i wanted people to say, you know, you don't have to be afraid of advertising. if i do it in this way, this is powering your show. but the whole issue of money is weird because people have these crazy feelings , wow, i knew he was a shill. he's a grifter. you know, okay. i didn't love that. i didn't love the issues. so i didn't set up a patreon. the security issues for talking and being me are significant. and i don't have the kind of money to hire around the clock. i mean, i desperately want to get to a level of wealth where i don't have to think about money. i don't think it's, you know, some people want money because they need it for status. i think i can handle status if i want it doing this. i don't want the status necessarily. and i don't want, i'd want the status, but i don't want the fame that goes with it. i want the money. i don't want to be seen as this is about money because it's about a substance. yeah. you know, all of those things. that's part of, i haven't solved these issues. i've been feeling bad because people say, where's the portal word? we're desperate. these are difficult times. we have an election coming up. and it's just , do you think for a moment that i want to explain that i actually got really uncomfortable being as well known as i was? and then what is it that i want? because i want to be better known and less well known at the same time. there's nothing the audience can do. i don't want the audience to be the audience. that doesn't make sense to people. i want it to be a business, but i don't think people need to fear a business if the business is open about being a business. that, and then that's all to the side. what you're seeing now in front of the election is an incredibly meta violent period in our online existence. and i believe that anybody who attempts to say these two parties are completely screwed at the moment, the leadership of these parties is unsolvable, unworkable. everyone hears that from inside the two party system. oh, i get it. he's trying to subtract votes off of biden. oh, i get it. he's trying to scuttle trump. oh, i get it. this is a play for his show because he's trying to plug in to discuss. there's a bill hicks routine on marketing. have you ever seen this? brilliant. i recommend it to everyone where he comes out on stage and he says, are there any people in marketing and sales in the audience? woo, yeah. it's , okay, great. can you do us all a favor and die? and everybody laughs. he's , no, i'm not laughing. i'm being serious. so he talks about how marketing is horrible. so you're , where's this act going? then he gets to the point of it. it's , , i know how you marketing people think. bill's going after that resentment dollar. that's good dollar. let's get that resentment anti-marketing dollar. yeah. it's , no, that's not what i'm saying. i really hate marketers. oh, that's good. it's the authenticity dollar. you can't escape this kind of negative marketing thought. and i guess that gets to the issue that i don't want to be destroyed in advance of this election. i don't think it's a good use of my relationship to my audience to be broadcasting how completely ridiculous donald trump and joe biden are as candidates for the president of the united states full stop. none of this makes any sense. these moderators of these pseudo debates were in the wrong format with the wrong people. no part of this makes a wit of sense. can i try to push back several claims? one is i don't believe the systems as they stand now can destroy their einstein voice, the voice. you're a child. i'm sorry to say that. but well, let me, well, it's also possible. let's fight. it's entirely possible that you're the child. okay. because a child would say, you would call other people a child. yeah, get in the first blow. it's a big reveal. it's a tell. because the only power they have is to attack you. the only power they have is to attack you psychologically. no. well, i believe that the army of people that love you is much more powerful than mainstream media, than people that you might hear it say ridiculous things that you just said, which is try to reduce you, the marketing, thinking, i just believe there's an army, maybe there's a better term of people that see you for who you are and hungry. i'm not disputing those things. that's what i'm saying. i would venture to say as your therapist that you're actually, the battle is all in your mind, that you have found these demons in the system and they're just a tiny minority and it's all in your mind. they cannot actually remove, they're not strong enough to remove the voice of eric weinstein, to silence the voice. i love this. this is some of the best fiction writing i've ever heard. let me tell you, i have relatives who've known me my entire life. where one article in the new york times, they will believe that over me. my contention is that has no power except to affect your psychology. what you have to do is the rogan thing, which is laugh. you're not hearing me. just laugh. i am laughing. i know, but more. i'm telling you something. yes. okay, the way this works is through ruin. ruin can come to anyone. there's no one who cannot be ruined. every single person is signed up right now to be ruined by the system. don't you understand that you have more power than the system. you can ruin the system. your twitter account, the podcast. i agree. that's what i'm telling you about the army. i agree that my twitter account, my pocket, but what we've seen, for example, you saw what happened to brett's articles of unity project? yes. okay, what happened? the, you mean from on the twitter site. on the twitter site, what happened? what happened? say the words. say the words. it was blocked or removed from twitter. suspended, account suspended. and the y is unclear. i have a direct line to jack. yeah. okay, so i'm talking to the ceo who i am crazy enough to still believe in. good. i do too. i believe it. somehow there's a very strange thing going on with jack dorsey. i cannot possibly reconcile the actions with the person i've, that is a next level mind in there. i'm not, i don't know it well enough to say that it's all next level. i'm not claiming he doesn't have any blind spots. every smart person i know has blind spots. i don't know what he's up against, blah, blah, blah. there's no way that the jack dorsey that i've talked to and the jack dorsey that interacted over articles of unity can be the same person. he is constrained by that company in some way that doesn't make sense to me. either that or he's the most duplicitous person on earth and i'm not believing it. i just don't buy it. okay? yeah. something horrible is happening. i, my claim is i can remove you functionally from the chess board in a tiny number of moves. no matter who you are, no matter how virtuous or how much of a bastard you've been your entire life, it doesn't take more than three or four moves to basically neuter you as a force. yeah, and i disagree that if that's possible, that means i'm not very good at chess. like unity 2020 was removed from twitter because it's not good enough. not within the system. like the army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea was too small. okay, but fear, uncertainty, and doubt is the name of the game, the coin of the realm. psychology though, it's not real power. it just affects the mind. okay, i have a reading assignment for you. because you're russian, you'll really enjoy this. as part of the great american tobacco settlement, the tobacco institute had to disgorge its archives of all of its strategies, all of its skullduggery, and put it on the web for all time so that we could all understand how the tobacco companies got together and destroyed people, right? you see tobacco destroys people. you can see, you know, scientology destroys people. there are various vindictive organizations that will not tolerate reality and opposition to them. let's take them down. okay. that's what i'm trying to tell you is- okay, no. so why aren't you doing the podcast to return? because that's one of the weapons of war. well, first of all, if you're at war, i don't want to discuss strategy on a podcast, right? but that's your misunderstanding- what did montgomery say about rommel? but wasn't his line, i read your book, you beautiful bastard. it's , why are you using the tactics that you already explained? okay, so one of the things i'm doing is i'm not having a strategic conversation with you and several hundred thousand of our closest friends. i pulled back because this is not the battle that i know what i'm doing. i do not feel passionately enough about defeating donald trump to elect joe biden, even if that's the way i'm going to ultimately vote, right? i don't believe in the biden democratic party. i don't believe in the trump republican party. so yes, it's an incredibly consequential election. but to me, it's the crips and the bloods and the latin kings fighting over the right to extort a business and the business trying to figure out who it wants to do the extorting. but don't you think, listen, there's very few people that are as good with the english language as you. don't you think it's possible to draw a line that doesn't, in between, that finds how we find our common humanity that ensures a better 2021 without having to say donald trump is evil or joe biden is incompetent or any of that, just somehow draw a beautiful line. eddie van halen. i'm seeing people in so much pain. this election is chewing up the integrity of everyone who comments on it, lex. maybe they're not good enough. they're not good enough. no, but that, okay. the hope is you're good enough. do you believe in me? yes. you do? yes. listen to me very carefully. my spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me to survive in this space, i've been mouthing off since the 80s, tells me this is a super dangerous time for smart people to be spending the dry powder because the election doesn't make sense. doesn't mean that i don't have a sense that one outcome would be better than the other, probably, but the variance on that, i'm not even positive that i'm right. these two options are so completely inappropriate to the world of 2020. what we need is so diametrically opposed to more boomers and more silent generation people trying to sort out a highly technical world being mediated through social media. we need more exclusion. we need more actual elites. the people we've called the elites are not the elite. they need to go. yeah, we need excellence, competence. we need people who can be trusted behind closed doors and we need to close the doors so we can't see what those people are doing. here's the thing. imagine that you had a bunch of people who'd all seen action in combat, had all volunteered to be part of the armed services, had all come from backgrounds where they didn't need to. so you were convinced that these people had put their lives on the line for their country, not for a payday. imagine you had 10 of these people with technical backgrounds, men, women, black, white, muslim, jew, doesn't matter, right? i would trust those people and i'd close the door. i don't wanna know what they talked about. i don't want transparency into all of their negotiations. i wanna know that they're patriotic, that they see something in the world bigger than themselves and their family fortunes. i wanna know that they're courageous. i wanna know that they've got all of our wellbeing and i'm willing to roll the dice and if they screw us over, i'd rather go down that. okay, so i disagree with you there because there's a difference between those and jaco because you're not speaking to people with credentials. no, i'm talking about self-credentialed people. i view jaco as self-credentialed. but the biggest, the powerful thing about jaco is he's not only self-credentialed but he's been real with people. the magical thing about jaco isn't his book, isn't his life story, is he's been talking on a podcast for a long, there's something real that happens. okay, so if you took dan crenshaw and tulsi gabbard and you took jaco willink and maybe jesse ventura, right? you can take- i see where you're going with this. what? you can take you can take all of these people who've really just risked. why is catherine hepburn the best that hollywood ever produced? because she told hollywood to go fuck itself. hard. they gave her four academy awards and she said, love you, sweeties, i'm gonna use them as the door stops for the bathrooms in my house. see, that's skill. that's just- that's what you were talking about. yeah. be catherine hepburn. audrey hepburn is pretty amazing, but catherine hepburn is next level, right? well, you, i mean- that's what you're trying to say to me. yeah. okay, i'm trying to figure it out, lex. okay, what kind of- i don't have the answer yet. what i do know is that this election is chewing people up and i mean two separate things. one, the parties don't have enough integrity that if you comment either for or against, there's a short sequence where you make a comment that's nuanced, you get referenced, you get referenced to something, right? like, you know, take this thing about, you know, find people on both sides. that is non-resolved after n years, whether the context should be reported or not. we are in some situation in which democrats and republicans are primed to fight each other, the way introducing two ants from two different ant colonies always produces a battle. yeah. okay? i don't want to be in that fray because those people are gonna kill each other mindlessly, robots. and until the election is concluded, , do i think this is dire? yes. could it be make or break? absolutely. i'm not saying that. do i know which way this goes? i can make an excellent argument that we need to elect joe biden right now. we've got a situation which can only be cured by voting for joe biden. i can make another argument that we could have a situation that can only be cured by defeating joe biden right now and all of the things that the modern democratic party represents. yeah. i don't have, you know, it's not the lady and the tiger. we're choosing between the tiger and the tiger. it's the sumatran tiger versus the siberian tiger. right? i'm trying to think, well, which tiger can i, do i have a better chance against? the key problem for us politically is that we have to divorce the concept of the center and moderation from kleptocracy. every time we try to say something , we need more moderate solutions, we need more pluralistic solutions, people will say, wow, you just want to hand us right back into the swamp, don't you? those swamp people, because the moderates and the swamp people are the same people. right? so then we have these two crazy wings. we can't have crazy right-wing people. i don't want any tiki torch bs. we can't have crazy left-wing, don't attack my courthouse. really don't attack my courthouse. and we can't have moderates. it's , okay, how do we install our children and rape pillage and get these speaking fees when we're out of office and become, you know, cozy with the things when we're supposed to be regulating them and then, you know, become their lobbyists, you know, immediately when we leave office, all of this stuff. we need an entirely different system. and i can't talk about that at the moment. when i talk, people say, , wow. so you're going to sit this one out because you're a pussy, because you're a coward. great to know, eric, we thought better of you. bye, click. i don't know what to do. so- but are you thinking of what to do? yeah. oh, you better believe it. look, brett had this idea of unity 2020 and i told him it was a wrong idea. i didn't tell him that unity 2024 was a wrong idea. i didn't tell him that unity 2028 is a wrong idea. and if i were to make the case that he was right and i was wrong, because he's now shuttered the thing, right, i would say that the case to be made that he was correct was, is that by doing this in 2020, we found out what we were up against. it's good to know that twitter can turn this off at the drop of a hat. great to know. it's good to know as we learned that you cannot have meetings of presidential candidates in a primary that are not approved of by the party. right? like they've got this thing figured out so we don't have any way in. and now unity 2024 makes sense because unity 2020 was tried. okay? i don't know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances. and some we do and some we don't. there's a game theoretic thing that i'm not sure you're accounting for, but you probably are, but let me just make an argument. is jack dorsey very likely listens to your podcasts? and this is the power of these words. something deep went wrong. but we can change it with the power of words. something went wrong at twitter. they have so much division on their platform. that's what i'm trying to say. they've gotten, it's not wrong. they just don't know they're understaffed. no, they have an insoluble problem. difficult to solve. they have an insoluble problem. this is where you and i disagree. because, well, all right. or i'd to create a competitor. no, so then, you know, give it to me. yeah. create the competitor. show me that you actually have understood this because my guess is, is that most of the things that you'll think about, i mean, i can tell you things that i've talked to jack about, which i know would make twitter much better. however, i think that this problem of instantaneous communication across the planet, and you subtract off all sorts of context and mutual self-knowledge, the problem is us. it's not the platforms. you're thinking about a technological solution, and i'm saying the problem is, is that we are ultimately the product. and i just disagree with that, and there's a lot of, that's probably could save that for tomorrow. i look forward to spending summers in your villa when you, when you debut this product, and i would love to angel invest in it. by the way, in terms of money, i'll never have a villa. yeah. no, i will always give away everything i own. don't do that. no, sorry. invest into things you mentioned, awesome things. yeah, yeah. invest fine, but a little bit of avuncular advice. don't pledge to be the person who disgorges themselves of security. money is freedom. that's what it is. it's a big hunking pile of freedom. okay. you can choose to use it as the freedom to imprison you. if you don't, you know, so you can use it as freedom to make yourself a prisoner of your money. but generally speaking, lex, money is freedom and your voice is important. at least retain the amount of money security you need to follow joe's advice. what is the point of fu money if you don't say fu? the number of people who have fu money who don't say fu indicates the number of people who chose the freedom of their wealth to create a prison. they built a prison with the freedom they had and they walked into it, locked the door. i think it's too difficult not to create it. the reason i wanna give away the money is because i just know my own psychology and you create prisons. our human mind just creates those prisons. the fu money is enough for basic shelter and basic food. that's the optimal fu. you don't have kids yet. okay, this is the problem. this is what i'm saying. so this is me, single lex, speaking. great. but kids change it. future lex. future lex, i'm talking to future lex. single present lex, please don't listen. don't be an ass. you're gonna need some money and don't make these pledges to say on a podcast. i wanna save you from yourself. you need money to do many of the beautiful things that we're counting on you to do. don't f it up. can i talk to you about roger penrose? sure. we've talked to roger on the portal, but also in between the lines and offline, just everything you've said about roger penrose. for people who don't know, he just recently, a few days ago, won the 2020, shared the 2020 nobel prize for physics. but it's clear to me that he had a deep personal impact on you, a connection with you in terms of both your love of mathematics, just the way you see the world. like this is the eddie van halen conversation. this is clearly somebody who's profound in your worldview. can you talk about roger? can you talk about what it means that he won this highest of prizes? just in general, let's celebrate the man. yeah, okay. so first of all, there are two other people who won this prize. i'm sorry, i just didn't happen to know who they were before they won. roger is a very, it is not roger in particular, but the class from which roger comes that is so important. so i would put roger in the class of feynman, einstein, dirac, yang. put whitten in there? yeah. i know. i mean, whitten's a special case, but whitten is weirdly the reverse of the roger penrose story, right? because whitten is the first physicist to win a mathematical fields medal, the highest honor in mathematics. penrose is in some sense a mathematician who's now won the nobel prize. so it's a perfect sort of a couplet. roger's class means everything to me. that's the highest achievement of the human mind. i'd probably throw bach in with feynman and dirac in company, right? i think that he was so inventive. it was very frustrating to watch this career. it's a little bit frustrating to watch feynman's career. feynman was so good. and had he been born at a slightly different time, i believe his claim on physics would be far greater. i feel penrose in some sense came up a very difficult path because you see einstein effectively solved most of the most important problems in general relativity right at the beginning. as a result, the children of einstein are impoverished because there wasn't as much to pick off of the trees and sell at the market, whereas bohr and planck didn't do nearly as good of a job with quantum theory. so there's lots to do in quantum theory. i think that roger affected me personally by a diagram that i saw in a paper of herman gluck at the university of pennsylvania. it was the first picture i'd ever seen of the hop vibration sketched. and that, weirdly i brought that to the rogan program in order to sort of convey the wonder. it was recapitulating my own journey. i think i probably saw that at age 16 or something. it just flipped my mind. roger is incredibly visual. he's incredibly geometric. he's incredibly sui generis. he just does his own thing. he's got lots of bets. none of them had really come through the way you would hope. and i think they stretched the rules to be blunt about it. to give him the prize. yeah, i do. you said this thing on twitter, which is beautiful, that every once in a while comes up a human being that gives value to the prize versus the prize giving value to the human. two different kinds of prizes. the reason that we care about the nobel prize isn't because of alfred nobel. it's because it came along at the right time to reward einstein, dirac, schrodinger, feynman. most of the people who should have won most of the awards are not good in the sense that they don't really follow. the prize is used to rewrite history. that's the problem. so you should have a love hate relationship with it because on the one hand it does focus the world on what really matters. and on the other hand, it distorts what really matters. and both of those functions take place simultaneously. in this case, i think that they violated their own rules slightly. so it wasn't really clearly a case of a prediction and a discovery in the typical fashion, but we better give this award to somebody of that highest caliber to make sure that the prize is fully funded with prestige going forward. that's sort of my weird speculative guess as to what happened. and so roger's getting on in years and the person should be alive. so i think they bent the rules and i think they couldn't have bent it for a better person. and i hope they will not bend the rules out of weakness, but out of strength in future. would be great to get madame wu and emmy nerder a posthumous prize along with doug prasher, george sudarshan and george zweig as well as ernst stuckelberg nobel prizes. there've been some terrible omissions on the first two being females who revolutionized our view of the world. and i take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes for people from ethnic groups or genders or whatever in order to make it plural and inclusive if it's not following the work. and i feel very clear that in a few cases, we know there was a real problem with the nobel committee because we have stunning accomplishments. try to get through a day as a physicist with that nerder's theorem and try to imagine the universe without madame wu's discovery that left and right don't appear to be symmetric. i mean, these are terrible omissions and there are a huge blot on science for not being more inclusive when it matters. yeah, so just you said, the nobel prize is plagued by omissions as much as- and distortions and dilutions. for example, dirac and schrodinger were, i believe, given the prize in the same year. there's no reason that those two people needed to dilute each other. the same thing with, you know, dyson was an omission. tomonaga probably got included in part because we had an opportunity to show that something had happened on both sides of the pacific after the war. but i don't think we needed to dilute weinberg or feynman or schwinger. it just makes me, it makes me somewhat sick. all of these people are such important giants and it has to do with the field, i think, not wanting to create luminaries and superstars who could have defended the field from budget cuts and worldly pressures. so i think it's really important that we have absolute superstars because we produce superstars. we acknowledge them, we don't dilute them and that we bend the rules to make sure that the prize stays funded with the prestige that comes from giving it to the roger penrose's, albert einstein's and paul de roque's of the world. can we talk a little bit about evil? sure. i haven't actually talked to you about this topic and it's been sitting on my mind mostly because everybody at mit is quiet about it, which is jeffrey epstein. i didn't get a chance to experience what mit was at the time when jeffrey epstein was part of this, but i'd love to try to understand how evil was allowed to flourish in a place that i love. whether you think, maybe let me ask the question this way, was it the man evil or was the system evil or is evil too strong a word? because what i see is the presence of this particular human being in the eyes of many destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weaken the ability, weaken the institution of mit by making everybody quiet, almost making them unable to say anything interesting or difficult. yeah. and what is that? and what am i supposed to? we don't know. why is everyone quiet about jeff? we don't know. what i wanna scream. we don't know. we don't know. obviously i wanna scream about it too, right? and i probably have said too much about jeffrey epstein. look, something horrible happened. i don't know what it is, but something horrible happened. and at the one thing that, okay, let's just do this. the first thing i need to do is i need to get rid of this woke crap about power differentials, okay? in general, you can talk about hypergamy and power differentials are russell conjugates of the same concept. just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically provable to be attractive in females to males. male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to amass power and success and all these sorts of things. the relationship between consenting adults is quite frankly, not something i wanna sort out. the relationship between the sexuality of adults and minors and particularly, there's the 17, 18 issue. that's very different than 12, 13. we're talking about really sick depravity with respect to what it appears that jeffrey epstein was involved in at some level. i believe this story is super complicated in part, because i think one thing that jeffrey epstein was doing was providing money, encouragement and support to scientists. another thing he was doing, i believe, was giving tax advice to scientists to very rich people. i believe another thing he was doing was hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females. another thing he was doing, i think, was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes. so there's an entire spectrum of different stuff. and at the moment, nobody can pull apart or de-conflate anything, because the woke thing comes over it and says, i think it's disgusting that a 43-year-old billionaire would be partying with a 23-year-old. okay, i don't wanna adjudicate that. i'm worried about 12 and 14-year-olds that we're not talking about. but i mostly- i don't think mit was deep into pedophilia. my guess is that that did not happen. i don't think that the scientists were the targets of the really sick, depraved stuff. it's my guess. my guess is that what you're looking at was a government construct. and it may have been our government. it may have been a joint government project. it may have been somebody else's government. i don't know. i believe that in part, we don't really understand robert maxwell. sorry, who's robert maxwell? gillain maxwell's father. he was very active in scientific publishing. i don't know where peer review came from. i would love to run down the relationship between peer review and robert maxwell. i would love to run down the missing fortune of robert maxwell and the mysterious fortune of jeffrey epstein, because i don't think jeffrey epstein ever ran a hedge fund. i don't think he was a money advisor the way people claimed. so there's two things i wanna talk about. so one is the shallow conversations of woke identity politics that you're referring to seems to be removing everyone's ability. no, everyone's willingness. one of the things. to talk about , what the hell is this person and how is he allowed? most importantly, to how do we prevent it in the future. and from the individual perspective, the question for me is the same question i ask about 1930s, nazi germany, i've been reading way too much probably, or not enough about that period currently, is if i was in germany at that time, what is the heroic action to take? when i think about mit with jeffrey epstein, what is the heroic action to take? we're not talking about virtue signaling action. you wouldn't know what. i would not know what you're up against, lex. you're not hearing me. the problem here is, what was jeffrey epstein? well, that question might be the heroic action to take, that's all i'm trying to say. i'm just trying to get my first question. you have to map the silence with jeffrey epstein. what you're describing is a map of the silence at mit. well, is there a map of the silence in washington state around jeffrey epstein? the bay area, new york city? the amount of silence around jeffrey epstein should be telling you everything. the number of dogs that don't bark is nothing we've ever seen. you're exactly correct, but i wanna know what is it telling us? because what it's telling me is not some kind of conspiracy, but more a disappointing weakness. not some kind of conspiracy? it's not some kind of conspiracy, but- you gotta be kidding. you're so afraid of saying the word conspiracy that you don't think it's a conspiracy? i personally, i just think it's people who i thought were my heroes just being weak. no, be of good cheer, sir. a cheer? be of good cheer. of good cheer? yeah. you think that there's a conspiracy? i think there is a conspiracy. that'd be a very impressive one. that's the scale of it. i tend to believe that large scale can only be an emergent phenomena. really? i find this so fascinating. yeah. i think we see you as a logic, logic and love drive your soul. you're very logical, you're relentless. you got a lot of love in your heart. i believe that if you would review the video, where is it from? dubai or abu dhabi of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest? you ever seen this thing? no. oh, what happened? it's the assassination in 2010, 10 years ago, of mahmoud al mabou, something that, in dubai, where i believe 26 separate individuals on multiple teams are shown converging, coming in from all over the world on false passports, pretending to be tennis players or business people or vacationers. and all of these teams have different functions and they murder this guy in his hotel room. and the dubai, i guess, chief of police or security officer was so angered that he put together this amazing video that says, we can completely detail what you did. we caught you on closed circuit tv. we don't know exactly who you are because your disguises and your false passports. but yeah, 26 people converged to kill one. no, i don't believe you. i don't believe after cointel pro, an operation paperclip and operation mockingbird, i don't know whether i should even bring up rex 84. to not believe in conspiracies is an idiocy. so you have a sense that evil can be as competent or more competent. first of all, when evil wants to operate at scale, it needs to make sure that people don't try to figure out evil. when evil operates at scale, from first principles, you have to realize that evil must not want it investigated. that's correct. the most efficient way to keep yourself from being investigated, if you are an evil institutional player and needs to do this repeatedly, is to invest in a world in which no one can afford to say the word conspiracy. you will notice that there is a special radioactivity around the word conspiracy. we have provable conspiracies. we have admitted to conspiracies. you have been invited to conspiracy. there is no shortage. conspiracies are everywhere. some of them are mundane. some of them are price fixing cartels, or trade groups are generally speaking conspiracies. so the first thing you have to realize is that all of us are under a, in a mimetic complex where you can be taken off the chessboard by saying, conspiracy theorist, get done. it's a one, it's a one line proof. we don't have to listen to lex. he said he was a conspiracy theorist on this show. okay, that is partially distorting our conversation. if you want to ask me about jeffrey epstein, you have to agree with me that that is a logical description of what you would have to have if you wanted to commit conspiracies, is that you have to make sure that people are dissuaded from investigating this. yes. okay. but it's a very, it's a fascinatingly difficult idea then because the world with conspiracy theories and the world without conspiracy theories to the shallow glance looks the same. well, my point, there is responsible conspiracy theorize where you look at the history of unearthed conspiracies. and just you would with any other topic, just think about how different the rules in your mind are for conspiracy theorizing versus x theorizing where x can be anything. right? it's , if i say to you, i can say the statement that average weight is not the same between widely separated populations. you'd say, yeah. i'd say average height is not the same between widely separated populations. you'd say, yeah. then i say, in fact, no continuous variable that shows variation should be expected to be identical between widely separate. of course, eric, iq. whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. right? so we have a violent reaction to specific topics. so the first thing i wanna do is just to notice that conspiracy has that built into everyone's mind. that's really important to state. yeah, it's very interesting that. and as a prerequisite, as you're saying, that would be the first step if you wanted to pull off a conspiracy in a competent way, that's you would have to first convince the world of that. i just watched the film 1971 about my favorite conspiracy of all time. i highly recommend it. 1971? well, the film is titled 1971. and it's about the citizens committee to investigate the fbi, which was run by a student of murray gelman, a physicist, and broke into fbi offices in pennsylvania to steal files, which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered a huge conspiracy. it was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government. a double conspiracy story, which launched multiple conspiracies. i think that the problem with modern americans is that they are so timid that they don't even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely proven. so with that done, jeff epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody's construction. i don't think that- it's kind of scary to think about. yeah, well, what part of the story isn't scary? i in part did something which i imagine may get me destroyed because i was more worried about being destroyed by somebody else. i had a conversation with around jeff epstein, right? so i'm just trying to get, let it be known that i don't know anything more than i've already said. now your friends at mit, their problem is is that jeff epstein showed up as the only person capable of continuing us scientific tradition. you see, the us scientific tradition is a little bit the russian. it's combative, okay? and we're a free society and we act a free society. we're a rich society and we research we're a rich society. that is historically. and then came the 1970s and william proxmire and the golden fleece awards and the idea that we're paying too much and these are welfare queens and lab coats and blah, blah, blah, blah. we need more transparency, more oversight. everything went to hell. and the national culture of us science was lost. the thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost. and then jeff epstein shows up. and a tiny number of funders, maybe fred kavli, maybe yuri milner, maybe who else would be in this category? peter thiel to an extent, howard hughes would be the largest of these things, which has different grant structures than the nih, gave people a modicum of risk-taking ability. okay, well, when jeff epstein showed up, everybody wanted to take risk in science. and suddenly a charismatic billionaire says, hey, i can make that work for you. here's $100,000, go research something crazy. well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal government under the terms of the endless frontier compact between the federal government and the universities. and the federal government and the taxpayers welched, okay? so that's one place to lay the blame for jeff epstein as the failure of the federal government. to honor its commitment, right? so the universities became psychopathic. it's not everybody doesn't remember what we're supposed to be doing to be moral, but the point was there wasn't enough money to be moral. so it was time to eye each other as a source of protein, as i to say. and in that process, jeff epstein said, hey, come to my world. we can do it we used to do. so in part, my point is, is that almost none of your colleagues at mit have that kind of religious commitment to science that they're willing to go down with ship science. the galileo galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally you just have to say, look, this isn't about me and you. you're not going to be able to do it. you're going to have to do it. this isn't about me and you. there isn't enough money in the world to buy the kind of legacy i want to leave to this planet. this is one of the great things about science. you know, potentially it's worth dying for. yeah. i'm glad you said it. science is one of the things at its best that's worth dying for. i mean, i'm not eager to martyr myself, but i've certainly risked my health, my fortune. you know, i've destroyed myself economically over science and my need to oppose these sons of bitches in chaired professorships who are destroying our system along with everyone else. let me bring in grandmaster uguay into this. uguay. uguay. master uguay. i think he's a grandmaster. that would make him a chess-playing turtle. so i read some wikipedia. uh-. and shifu is a master. there's apparently only one grandmaster. that's uguay. anyway. is the phrase grandmaster ever uttered in the script? i don't think so. i don't think so. but there's a story. oh, there's off-script canon. i'm going to call glenn burger right now and find out if any of this is true. all right. you're not supposed to call out my journalistic integrity. but... master uguay. master uguay. he says a couple things i'd to bring up with you. so one, as part of a longer quote, recommends that you should find a battle worth fighting. we've talked about several battles just now. what is the battle worth fighting for, for eric weistein, in the next few months, in the next year? there's only one. it's the moses. it's the moses thing. it's time to go. it's time to leave. this place is over. to get off the planet. yeah, i freak people out when i say that. but, , look at your world. you just got introduced to the problem of a virus. wait till it's fusion devices, and you understand what it means to have one interconnected planet with no uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else. you know? so do you see the foray, your work in physics, and maybe, , the echoes of it in ship elon? everybody who has a possible plan to avoid what is coming if we don't have one should work on the plan that he, she thinks best. right? so elon wants to do rockets. people misinterpret me. meta eric says, i don't think that's a smart plan. regular eric says, all people who have hope should do that thing. at least it's mars, man. at least it's the moon and mars and maybe titan and whatever, and i don't think it'll work, and it doesn't make sense, and it looks silly. but that's exactly the kind of fight worth fighting. but it's the kind of... it's for the same reason that i went on brett's unity 2020 thing when i didn't think it had a hope in hell, and people are making fun of it. it's , we got to do things that make us feel dumb and silly and childish that possibly have a hope of working. okay? so everybody should do something. my version of this, i am the most hopeful about because i wouldn't have chosen to do it if i thought that daniel schmackenberger's wisdom project was a better hope, i'd do that. it's more down to earth in a certain way. i just think that it's more probable. look, we got from powered flight with the wright brothers in wind tunnels to sending back images from the surface of titan via huygens cassini in less than a century. okay? what we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive of. it may be that it buys us nothing. and at least we will know why we died on this planet. as a small aside, i think this is not the right time to take the full journey, but i feel you'll guide me master wu wei did, and i'm the kung fu panda at some point. they only have one conversation. we're on our what? we didn't. well, we're jews and they weren't, so we talk too much. but the guide doesn't have to be with words. you don't think po was jewish? it's debatable. we'll have to go back to the wikipedia. really food. yeah, okay. is there that you would guide me through some more intuition about the source code, the source code of our universe? can you comment on where since we last spoke, where your thinking has been, has roamed around geometric unity, around that work in physics in this fight? i'm trying to figure out when to release it now. i mean, i've released the video, and the video, quite honestly, i think it has a very bizarre reaction. i think one of the things that i've learned from the video, because the video is coming up on half a million views on youtube alone to say nothing of the audio. but yeah, it produced a very strange reaction. one of the things i don't think that i properly understood is that most physicists don't talk in this geometric language. i thought that more of the physics world probably had converted over into manifolds, bundles, differential forms, connections, curvature, tensors, etc. and i saw a lot of the comments would say things , i have a phd in theoretical physics, and i'm not even familiar with all of these concepts. and i think that was probably a distortion coming from living in cambridge, massachusetts for almost 20 years. so what's the solution to that? i can translate it into that. i can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to. my problem is, my calculation is that as long as the boomers are still in charge, the same people have these perverse incentives on them, where they've invested in these programs that didn't work, so they're extremely hostile and kind of difficult to deal with. the fact that i'm not a physicist has its own set of issues, which is that effectively it's the hermit kingdom. they don't get any visitors, and they don't necessarily want somebody rolling up and saying, i know how to do physics. so i'm always very clear, i'm not a physicist. that said, if i wait too long, i don't know that theoretical physics is really going to exist after the boomers, because everyone in you, i think you had wolfram on your program. i don't remember whether he said this to you or brian keating, but he said something everybody got discouraged. it was too hard. we can't do that, guys. we cannot do that. there's something about the renormalization revolution that innervated the physics community, because it taught them, just because you can see in this energy regime doesn't mean you can extrapolate somewhere else unless you understand how coupling constants run and what kind of uv fixed points exist, blah, blah, blah. somehow that discouraged people from guessing, from believing. everything became an effective theory. the beauty of the effective theory wasn't taken to be really the beauty of the universe, just the beauty of an energy level. so i think that renormalization was one of the most important revolutions that ever happened in science, and also its interpretation by the physics community was catastrophic. the story i'm telling myself is that in part i'm waiting for them to get weaker. but on the other hand, i don't know that we have any time left. are you also thinking about ways of... the podcast medium is revolutionary for public discourse. i don't even know the right words for it. are you thinking of revolutionary ideas for re-energizing the physics community? basically, for communicating geometry? i have a fantasy. my fantasy is that all of these things are the same problem. it goes back to this thing that i read about in feynman's books about tartaglia. they asked him this question, , what's the greatest thing that ever happened in math? he says, tartaglia's solution of the cubic. it's just the weirdest answer. you're , okay, i'll bite. why is it tartaglia's solution of the cubic? and he said, because it was the first time a modern person had done something profound that the ancients had failed to do. i was , , i get it. it's the thing that opens up new psychology that says maybe things are possible again. it's a new orchard. new orchard. new farmers, new people who can find fruit that they can pick. and once you have one person do that, very often you get many. like one of the things that we were talking about with eddie van halen, the reason that he created a revolution and somebody roy buchanan did not is that you could follow eddie van halen. you couldn't pioneer it. and maybe you couldn't play as well and as cleanly and as fast and as inventively, but you could follow. once you understand that there is a tapping principle, it was just the beginning of something called percussive guitar. my belief is that once we start innovating in the present, everything will come because everything that around us is screwed up. on that, let me, with one last question, bring back master uguay, the probably the most famous quote of his, right? with yesterday's history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a gift. that is why it is called the present. it's very beautiful, although i would have gone with quit, don't quit, noodles, don't noodles. i feel people need to know way too much context for that to make sense. it's your audience. to hell with context. yep. they'll figure it out. well, let me ask, what are you grateful for today? what is your present? we've talked about a lot of dark things, but what do you brings you joy to your heart that i can't believe i'm lucky enough to have this? no, naila and zev, my wife, pia, the fact that we've got our health, all the little things, saying grace after meals. you're coming over for friday night shabbat dinner. so we'll say we'll bench together and say grace. it's important to just this bottle of water in front of me. i made a point of just thinking about how wonderful it is that there's a quenching bottle that happens to be placed in front of me because somebody cared. you know, that small thing made a difference to me. i still have strength for the fight so far. i think that's something i'm grateful for. i can't believe that i'm not more beaten down after all of this nonsense. i have the most interesting set of friends. i really do. i mean, i'm not that rich by monetary standards, but if there were friend billionaires, forbes would be all over my ass. i just can't believe who i can talk to, you know, at the drop of a hat. and i'm really grateful. i think this is the end of something profound, and it's the beginning of whatever is next. and whatever is next could be terminal. whatever is next could be amazing. whatever is next could be a return to the horrors of the early 20th century that doesn't manage to go totally catastrophic, but, you know, takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process. i'm grateful to having half of my life in the rear view mirror. maybe it took place in a bubble, and maybe it was unsustainable. but it was nice to be able to move around the world without a mask. it was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world, even if it was from a cot in a hostel in some country. to fall in love? absolutely. i mean, it was a good life. to find the last indian jewish girl left? who knew? you're a lucky guy. well, let me just say. actually, there's something i wanted to just say before you get to that. yes. i forgot to say something. falling in love with an intellectual collaborator is a special thing that not everybody gets a chance to do. i think when i met pia, i fell deeply in love with her, all her normal characteristics. she and i had an antagonistic relationship around geometry and economics. and then, weirdly, just in a buddy picture where in the first half of the film they hate each other, the two fields were fighting with each other, cats and dogs. and finally, the sexual tension clearly was so thick you could cut it with a knife. and we came up with geometric marginalism, which is this other theory, not geometric unity, which allowed me to inhabit space with somebody who i already knew intimately and had fallen in love with. and to see the quality and beauty of their mind and to play and to dance, it's sort of the intellectual version of the tango. one of the most romantic periods of my life that doesn't fall into most people's experience. so that was a chance to see something totally unexpected. haven't really had it since because she doesn't want to revisit the material, but something i'm super grateful for that's very particular and unique. but to flip the tables on you, for hundreds of thousands, i think millions of people, i can speak, me and them are really grateful, one, that you exist and two, sorry for your podcast. and i do hope your voice in some form continues to reverberate, i think, in the at least in the twenty twenty ones and and beyond, even if it takes a brief pause. we're pausing at the moment. we've recorded some for future episodes and i'm recording for you. i really appreciate that. i mean, it's earnestness trades at a discount at the moment because it's easy to make fun of it. one of the things i best about you is that you and i are both fairly earnest. we made we made joke and jab. but honestly, there's a project here in a world to win, as they say. the thing that i want my and your listeners to know is that i'm not stepping away from the podcast because i don't appreciate that people really want more. it's not you know, this is hugely financially costly to me. i want to make sure you guys are getting the best that i can do and destroying myself right in front of an election. i think lex is incorrect. i think that the forces that are trying to make sure that there aren't any planes in the sky that aren't either colored red or colored blue is a big danger, given how angry i am at the system. and i don't want to be removed from the chessboard because if nobody's going to talk about jeff epstein, there need to be people. if nobody's going to talk about various things that we've talked about on these programs, i want to make sure that i'm there. do i think that this is potentially an existential election? yes. am i positive that i know that my way to bed is the right way out? no, i'm not. i don't know people. i just don't know. where we are right now seems so dumb and so catastrophic in terms of how it is chewing up smart people that i decided it's really not about cowardice because it's hard for me to restrain myself. i have so many reactions every day. this is really about trying to plan for all of our futures to make sure that i'm around. i had a huge concern that what happened to brett's articles of unity was going to happen to brett. it's going to happen to the youtube channels. i want to make sure that we don't have all of our eggs in one basket. if something goes wrong over there, that's the whole idea of the intellectual dark web, which is at some level a loose confederation. it can become a strong confederation if somebody wants to back it and make it work. it can dissolve so that there really isn't anything. the thing is to be hard to kill because ultimately when the hit pieces come, they don't come for what it is that they're angry at you about. they come for where they can get you. it's very important that right in front of an election, yeah, i think that the desire of the old system to defend itself through reputational destruction is one of the most pernicious aspects of the new america. we have to fight the ability to destroy reputations as a means of institutions keeping individuals with podcasts and the ability to reach millions through substack out of their domain. i don't surrender this domain to them. they have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us. i believe that they could remove you or me in an instant. by the end of today, if they wanted us off the chessboard, we would be off the chessboard. i know that's not your perspective. my goal is to stay here as long as possible to make sure that you have enough of a counterbalancing set of ideas and to let and help other podcasts to start. and my hope is that that works. but you know, long heroism, short martyrdom is a good motto for anyone. and i try to remember the short martyrdom part of that. first of all, beautifully put. second of all, a way to end the conversation and the disagreement, which is how you hook them for the next conversation to be continued. when lex says. eric, it's a huge honor. thank you once again. lex really appreciate every time we get together. thanks, buddy. thanks for listening to this conversation with eric weinstein. and thank you to our sponsors. grammarly, a service i use in my writing to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure and readability. sunbasket, a meal delivery service i use to add healthy variety into my culinary life. semrush, the most advanced seo optimization tool i've ever come across. i don't looking at numbers, but someone should. it helps you make good decisions. and finally, expressvpn, the vpn i've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet. please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. if you enjoy this thing, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcast, follow on spotify, support on patreon or connect with me on twitter at lex friedman. and now let me leave you with some words from leonard cohen in the song titled hallelujah. well, maybe there's a god above, but all i've ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you. and it's not a cry that you hear at night. it's not somebody who's seen the light. it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': 'hello medium. its possible that im a little late to this party. in the end, i didnt end up importing everything. because medium appears to lack the ability to auto-import articles from jekyll (preposterous! who would have thought?!), i had to manually migrate or at least extensively edit most of the content. only the top 50 or so articles that were receiving significant traffic from google analytics made the cut. so i had an excuse to cheat a bit and discard a lot of the chaff. looking back on the rants and raves of 20-something me (the way that soon 40-something me will look back on 30-something me), even the best of those posts can still seem rather embarrassing. misplaced enthusiasm for absurd tools, often impractical nih-ism, and terrible grammar are among the many crimes of my youth. its also readily apparent that the tech industry as a whole has evolved a lot; 2007s developer best practices were not what we would today consider practices at all, let alone preferential practices. such is progress. reading through those old posts was also inspiring. it reminded me that at one time a regular writing schedule served a super important developmental function for me. its widely documented that there are a bunch of pretty great benefits that one gets from writing on the regular. it helps you organize and reframe your thoughts, it can be therapeutic during hard times, and improves memory recall. if nothing else, its a fantastically cheap type of external memory. writing something down means you never have to ask what exactly did i do yesterday, anyway? or how long did that crazy project take me and what did i actually learn from it? (anyone who doesnt manage their life through daily todo lists is definitely missing out on an awesome party). the most important benefit for me was that writing in public was a way of committing myself to certain things, on a certain schedule, at a time when my life was pretty much completely unscheduled. knowing that i had to publish an article every week, or every month, or on any schedule really, ensured that i was continuously learning things that were worth talking about, and later, building things that had enough value to share even if i was sometimes inventing those things just so i could share them. and even if no one was listening (which was frequently the case). not everyone needs this sort of framework for self-discipline', 'completion': 'written'}\n",
      "{'prompt': \"mr. president, events in eastern and central europe that were gratifying to all of us occurred or were about to occur when the united states and the soviet union were meeting in your country. while congratulating you on being elected to your high office, i also wish to pay tribute to malta, a non-aligned country that provided the background for one of the episodes that accompanied - and perhaps contributed to - the fundamental changes in present-day international relations. i should also to pay tribute to joseph garba of nigeria, who presided with talent and authority over the forty-fourth session of the assembly, during which, inter alia, we adopted by consensus a declaration on apartheid and its destructive consequences in southern africa; that declaration played a part in creating the international climate which led to the release of that great fighter, nelson mandela. if the united nations today is witnessing not a rebirth but a new birth, we also owe this to the tireless efforts, great patience and calm perseverance of the secretary-general who, true to his mission and his responsibilities, has upheld against all odds the principles, purposes and objectives of the charter. the independence of namibia, which we welcomed here in april upon its admission to the organisation, was one of his principal concerns. just as we hail unified yemen and unified germany, we also welcome among us with particular pleasure liechtenstein, whose initiative gives further proof of the universality of the organization's usefulness in these difficult and uncertain times. barely had we witnessed the final throes of the east-west confrontation when we found ourselves at a new turning-point in history. a combination of geopolitics, selfish considerations, half-truths, cunning tricks and flagrant bias have brought us to our present pass. iraq has invaded kuwait, and burkina faso, the rest of the international community, condemns that flagrant violation of the charter of the united nations and of the sovereign rights of a member state. today the situation is at worst an intolerable attack on law and justice and at best a conflict between law and justice. nevertheless, the clear-sightedness and experience of peoples prevent them from being misled by concealed interests that by their nature are constant and unchanging. principles that were ignored in similar situations in the past are now being cited for the sake of those interests. in the name of that clear-sightedness and experience, i should to set forth burkina fasos view of the problems that beset us and that make the struggle for justice and peace so loner and so arduous. the important political, economic and social changes that we have witnessed and participated in are occurring along a line and in a context that is gradually beginning to be seen for what it really is a split papered over with the un-kept promises of some and the un-avowed purposes of others. by engaging in such fruitless exercises we are quite simply compromising the future of the world's children, even though last sunday in this very hall we solemnly recognized that 'there can be no task nobler than giving every child a better future'. in whatever context we place them, the problems are numerous and the solutions few. a good climate makes a good harvest only if the seed is good. what kind of seed are we sowing? in the middle east the situation, under the impact of the events in the gulf region, remains highly sensitive, the more so because we do not understand what difference there is between an annexation that took place two months ago and another that has now persisted and been developing in various unofficial but concrete forms for 22 years. the immigration of soviet and eastern european jews to the occupied arab territories is further inflaming an open wound. the intifadah continues to be a revolt against injustice and a call for justice to prevail. the convening of an international conference on peace in the middle east, bringing together all the parties concerned, is becoming an increasingly pressing imperative for those who seek a genuine and definitive solution to the problem. lebanon, which has long been the victim of a conflict that is overwhelming it, awaits the restoration of its state and the coming of national reconciliation. we hope that the efforts of the tripartite commission will be successful. with regard to afghanistan, my country remains concerned at the pernicious continuance of fratricidal combat. a comprehensive political settlement in accordance with the consensus resolutions adopted at the forty-third and forty-fourth sessions of the general assembly should be supported in order to achieve the unity and harmony needed for the country's reconstruction and development. in korea the opening of preliminary discussions at seoul foreshadows a better future for reunification. burkina faso is of the view that one way to encourage that process would be to avoid taking negative and partisan attitudes and thus to enable the long-divided korean people to reunite. with regard to cambodia, we hope that the framework document of 28 august 1990 drawn up by the five permanent members of the security council will lead to an agreement among all the parties to the conflict and that peace will come back to stay. reaffirming burkina faso's support for the unity, sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-aligned status of cyprus, we hope that the secretary-general's mission of good offices will bear fruit. my continent, africa, is prey to acute conflicts, for which, we feel, the international community should, in one way or another, help to find a peaceful settlement. more specifically, with regard to western sahara, burkina faso continues to support the joint good offices of the current chairman of the organization of african unity (oau) and the secretary-general of the united nations. it expresses its satisfaction at the adoption of security council resolution 658 (1990) on 27 june 1990 and hopes that the organization of a true referendum on self-determination will bring lasting peace and stability to the region. with regard to liberia, burkina faso reaffirms its firm support for an appropriate solution and stresses the urgent need for increased humanitarian assistance to the liberian people. burkina faso supports the convening of a special summit meeting of the economic community of west african states to promote reconciliation and a peaceful and definitive resolution of that fratricidal conflict. in mozambique and angola, we encourage the efforts being carried out to restore peace through dialogue. in south africa, apartheid remains, and although nelson mandela is out of prison he is not yet free. burkina faso, along with the international community, is waiting for the abolition pure and simple of apartheid and is waiting for mr, de klerk to take irreversible steps in that direction. the economic sanctions are still necessary, and the south african people must maintain the same vigilance in the face of attempts at division and the fomenting of internal strife. agreement, co-operation and now interaction between the two military super-powers mark a break with the past and are producing an impact on all international relations, particularly through the reducing of hot-beds of tension, the consolidation of the disarmament process and the functioning of the security council as it was envisaged in 1945. i have already said that a good climate does not make a good harvest unless there is good seed. what do we have on the economic side? it is clear that at the end of the twentieth century we are witnessing a unique phenomenon. we are privileged witnesses of an acceleration of history with a scope that is difficult to measure. the only certainty is that we are watching the scene being set in the theatre of the unknown that the twentieth century has always been for the authors of science fiction. the international community must set the scene, but it must take every precaution to ensure that there will not be a tragedy. in other words, the progress achieved by mankind in the political and technological areas throughout the twentieth century must not be compromised by economic distortions, which can lead only to a confrontation prejudicial to the welfare and the survival of the species. there is an urgent need for north and south to learn to march together and in harmony so that neither enters the future a step behind. that was already, we need not recall, the main objective of the first united nations development decade. since then, and at the start of the fourth development decade, disappointment has reached its peak among the poor; the poorest of the poor are filled with despair, while others take refuge in shameful selfishness. it is intolerable that today, in this era of abundance and technological successes that defy the imagination, more than a billion human beings live in absolute poverty; that as many - 900 million adults and 100 million children - are illiterate; that 1.7 billion have no access to drinking water; that 800 million are hungry; that one child in three is malnourished; and that 14 million children die before the age of five. what is even more unacceptable, because it shows the failure of north-south co-operation, is that the flow of resources from developed countries to developing countries, which was positive 10 years ago, has been reversed outrageously, falling from $42.6 billion in 1980 to minus $33 billion today. the indebtedness of the developing countries in 1990 exceeds $1,300 billion, with debt servicing of $200 billion. in view of the drop in commodity prices that the developing countries have suffered in the past few years, the deterioration in the terms of trade is only becoming worse. thus, burkina faso, a cotton-exporting country must today pay the equivalent of the value of 30 tons of its product to buy a tractor, as opposed to 10 tons in 1970. because of this, any investment effort aimed at economic growth is dependent today on external assistance. we have seen that this assistance is an aberration in terms of flow of resources and is an unbearable burden in terms of dues and taxes. moreover, it has become discriminatory and insufficient, not to say sparse. the decade of the 1930s, a lost decade for the development of our countries, has also, paradoxically, been the decade during which the concept of the quality of life has become universal. thus, rich countries have striven to implement social policies with the ultimate aim of securing the well-being of the human person. for their part, the poor countries, while ensuring the survival of their populations, now justly demand that development have a greater qualitative content. moreover, it seems that rich and poor have finally agreed to recognize the urgency of preserving and restoring our environment. it is to be hoped that this common heritage of mankind - endangered by the actions of the human race, and technological development principally - will be restored by the human race through the implementation of the latest techniques. the same applies to the survival of our planet and its civilisations. we must urgently orient research towards technologies that will reduce the emission of certain gases such as chlorofluorocarbons and carbon dioxide, responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer, the development of the greenhouse effect and acid rain, whose combined effects are irreversibly altering our environment. the next united nations conference on the environment, scheduled to be held in rio de janeiro, brazil, in 1992, will be the occasion for re-establishing a truth which seems to have been forgotten, namely, that development is indispensable for the well-being of people but at the same time it has its own limits. that applies to the environment but also, and above all, to societies whose balance is frequently threatened by economic choices favouring developmentgrowth to the detriment of the more harmonious development which encompasses all aspects of human life. as i stressed at the forty-fourth session of the general assembly, that is where our conception diverges from that of the rich countries when we speak about such important ideas as democracy and human rights. i repeat here that for us the defence of democracy and of human rights come via the promotion of a more just international economic order. in this regard, we cannot pass over in silence our partners' failure to respect the goals set by common agreement here in the general assembly and throughout the united nations system for international economic co-operation for development. the poor results of both the eighteenth special session of the general assembly, held from 23 march to 1 april 1990, and the second united nations conference on the least developed countries, held in paris from 3 to 14 september, are clearly signs of a lack of political will. however, we hardly need recall that our countries have agreed to huge sacrifices to restore our macro-economic balance and have adopted bold programmes to stimulate growth, despite structural disorders and the profound crisis affecting the world economy. as far as burkina faso is concerned, we made our own adjustments several years before we appealed to the international financial institutions. we now expect the bretton woods institutions and our traditional partners to give us the new resources that will provide the revivifying oxygen necessary for economic recovery and for social well-being, which are objectives of our second five-year development plan. the aim of the second plan is to consolidate the gains made in the priority sectors during the first plan, while stressing economic growth and human development. on the domestic front still, since october 1977 comrade president blaise compaore and the popular front have been working, within the framework of the people's democratic revolution, to create the fundamental and real conditions in which the people itself can take on the management and direction of their affairs. the first congress of the popular front called for a constitutional process, and so in 1991, there will be major electoral events in the country, enabling it to go on putting in place the political institutions in keeping with its people's requirements for social and political democracy. our ambitions are neither out of the ordinary nor out of place. they stem from the will to survive and to integrate ourselves into the community of nations. generally speaking, we take as our basic objectives those set by the united nations itself. these relate inter alia, to food self-sufficiency, access to drinking water, primary health care, literacy and improving living conditions. to attain these objectives, which are the basis for all development, we are using our own territory and means; we are relying on the regional framework and south-south co-operation; and we welcome any contribution from outside our country and region consolidating the south-south co-operation effort and the north-south contract of solidarity. in general terms, we are convinced that, for the pivotal decade of the 1990s, external assistance must be in large quantity and of good quality and must take account of the particularities of the recipients. we should therefore review the aid philosophy and try to solve the problem of poor countries, indebtedness in order to inject enough new resources into their economies for there to be growth and development. unless adequate steps are taken, we fear that the impoverishment and marginalisation of whole nations will in time become a serious threat to international peace and security. in this respect, east-west detente, the socio-political upheavals in eastern europe and the integration of the whole eastern european region into the rest of europe, which we see beginning, are consolidating the north-south divide. the governments represented here and they alone are responsible for seeing to it that this new division in the world does not contain within it the seed of future conflicts. wisdom would dictate that the dividends of peace following on detente should serve peace through massive investment in development. reason dictates that the north - that is, yesterday's east and west - should join forces to support the south in its daily struggle for survival, growth, development and a better life. the twenty-first century will, if we so desire, be the century of the greatest good for the greatest number. and is that not also democracy?\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"1. basics arabs and ottomans a checkered relationship is a collection of thematic essays that delves into the complex relationship between arabs and ottomans. the book explores various aspects of this relationship, including political, cultural, and religious dimensions. the key takeaway from this book is that the relationship between arabs and ottomans was not always smooth, but rather marked by periods of cooperation and conflict. 2. characters or key figures the book does not focus on individual characters or key figures. instead, it provides an overview of the historical relationship between arabs and ottomans as a whole. however, it does mention several important historical figures, such as sultan selim i, who conquered mamluk egypt and syria in 1516-17, and sultan abdulhamid ii, who ruled the ottoman empire during its final decades. 3. major themes the major themes of the book include the political dynamics between arabs and ottomans, the cultural exchange between the two groups, and the role of religion in shaping their relationship. the book also examines how this relationship evolved over time, from the early days of the ottoman empire to its decline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. in terms of alignment with christian doctrine, the book highlights the importance of understanding and respecting different cultures and religions. this aligns with the christian principle of loving one's neighbor and seeking to understand others. 4. top 5 helpful advices from the book 1. understand the complex history of the relationship between arabs and ottomans. 2. recognize that this relationship was marked by both cooperation and conflict. 3. appreciate the cultural exchange that took place between the two groups. 4. acknowledge the role of religion in shaping their relationship. 5. learn from the lessons of the past to better understand current events in the region. 5. reflection as i reflect on the book, i realize that the central message is that the relationship between arabs and ottomans was multifaceted and dynamic. the author supports this message through careful analysis of historical documents and sources. the implications of this argument are significant, as it challenges simplistic narratives about the relationship between arabs and ottomans and encourages us to seek a deeper understanding of this complex history. 6. skill reproduce to apply the skills learned from this book, one could start by researching the history of a specific region or time period involving arabs and ottomans. then, analyze primary sources such as letters, diaries, and official documents to gain insight into the political, cultural, and religious dynamics at play. finally, use this information to draw conclusions about the relationship between arabs and ottomans during that time period. 7. reasoning (qa or interview) q what was the relationship between arabs and ottomans ? a the relationship between arabs and ottomans was complex and marked by periods of cooperation and conflict. it involved political, cultural, and religious dimensions. q why did the relationship between arabs and ottomans evolve over time? a the relationship between arabs and ottomans evolved over time due to changes in political power, cultural exchange, and shifts in religious dynamics. q how can understanding this relationship help us today? a understanding the complex history of the relationship between arabs and ottomans can help us better understand current events in the region and promote greater cultural understanding and tolerance. 8. pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller once upon a time, in a land far away, there were two powerful groups the arabs and the ottomans. they lived side by side, sometimes getting along and sometimes fighting. their relationship was a rollercoaster ride, full of ups and downs. one day, a wise king named sultan selim i decided to conquer the lands of the arabs. he was very strong and brave, and his armies were powerful. after a long and hard battle, he won and brought the arab lands under ottoman rule. but even though they were now ruled by the same king, the arabs and ottomans still had their own cultures and ways of life. they traded stories, music, and food with each other, and learned from one another. they also practiced different religions, but they respected each other's beliefs. over time, the ottoman empire grew weaker, and the arabs began to gain more power. they fought for their freedom and eventually won it back. but even though they were no longer ruled by the same king, they still remembered the good times they had together and the things they had learned from each other. and so, the story of the arabs and ottomans continued, full of twists and turns, but always marked by their shared history and the lessons they had learned from each other. and they lived happily ever after, united by their shared experiences and the knowledge that they could overcome any challenge together. the end.\", 'completion': 'written'}\n",

will guide this session to a fruitful conclusion. i would also to extend my thanks to your predecessor, ambassador han seung-soo of south korea, for his excellent stewardship of the previous session of the general assembly. somalia welcomes the democratic republic of east timor and the swiss confederation to the membership of this family of nations. this is a further step towards the realization of the goal of the universality of the united nations organization. a year after the tragic events of 11 september 2001, we in somalia continue to share the feelings of pain and loss of the government and the people of the united states. we must, as a community of nations, act in unison to combat the scourge of terrorism. in this regard, the transitional national government of somalia continues to be a reliable partner in the campaign against terrorism. it is my privilege to announce to the assembly that my government this year signed the convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism. we have also started the process of acceding to the convention on the prevention and combating of terrorism of the african union. we are also working on the implementation of the other requirements of resolution 1373 (2001). furthermore, we are committed to fully cooperating with other countries on a bilateral basis in the fight against terrorism and continue to identify concrete areas of such cooperation. my government's resolve in this regard is not based on any short-term tactical considerations but is unequivocal and based on solid principles. we would to commend the united nations for organizing a number of international conferences in 2002, starting with the international conference on financing for development and the recent world summit on sustainable development, held in johannesburg, south africa. we also applaud the 22 united nations for dedicating a day of discussions on the new partnership for africa's development (nepad), which focused on the development needs of the african continent. we strongly feel that the international community should pay more attention to the development needs of the least developed countries. donors and creditors should be able to do much more in the areas of trade, debt and aid. we believe that free and fair trade is a vehicle for growth and development, and that thus we are required to make greater efforts to ensure that multilateral trading caters to the urgent and special needs of the least developed countries. in this regard, we are encouraged by canada's unilateral decision to lift tariffs on african exports to canada and to abolish subsidies on agricultural products. it is our hope that other developed countries will follow the example set by canada. with regard to debt, we believe that, unless the massive debts owed by the least developed countries are completely cancelled, those countries will remain strangled by interest and loan principal payments. aid can be another engine for development and growth and, in this respect, the donors must honour the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance. we cannot but address the plight of the palestinian people, who are subjected to daily horrors. the killing of innocent civilians, including women and children, the destruction of houses and the daily humiliations inflicted upon the palestinian people by israel must be condemned by the international community. it is unconscionable for the international community to stand idly by and watch the continuous siege of president yasser arafat and the premeditated destruction of the palestinian authority. the people of palestine, who continue to suffer under the israeli occupation, have an inalienable right to a state of their own and to choose their own leadership and institutions. the systematic violation of the fundamental human rights of the palestinian people must be brought to an end. the scourge of conflicts has been afflicting the african continent for decades. in fact, africa at one time was dubbed the continent of conflict. it is gratifying to note that there is a new horizon that a new dawn is illuminating the darker parts of our continent in conflict. conflict resolution by africans themselves is the motto today. a strong wind of peace is blowing in africa. in sierra leone and liberia in the mano river region; in angola; in the democratic republic of the congo, rwanda and burundi in the great lakes region; and in ethiopia, eritrea and the sudan in the horn of africa, the ship of peace is sailing. we strongly welcome this movement towards peace in the african continent. as members are aware, somalia has been an area of a conflict, a conflict that brought untold suffering to the people of somalia, a disastrous civil war fomented by unpatriotic warlords, resulting in the destruction of all state institutions, the death of hundreds of thousands of somalis and the displacement of millions. despite the good intentions of the united nations, somalia suffered from the neglect of the international community, especially after 1993. the somali conflict seemed intractable. it was not until august 2000 that a transitional national government and a transitional national assembly were constituted and a head of state, his excellency mr. abdikassim salad hassan, was elected. that was a result of a conference held in arta, in the republic of djibouti, attended by more than 3,000 somalis from all regions and all walks of life, including traditional leaders, intellectuals, business persons and women. the warlords were repeatedly invited and opted not to participate. the transitional national government of somalia has continued to engage in dialogue those who choose to be outside the arta process, with a view to bringing them on board. we have been persistent in encouraging them to renounce war as a means of achieving political gains, and we share our vision of peace and national reconciliation in somalia and for the somali people. in our endeavours to achieve peace and stability in somalia, we have also engaged our brothers elsewhere in the subregion, regional organizations and the united nations, to assist us in the search for durable peace in somalia. i am happy to note that the intergovernmental authority on development (igad), with the strong support of the international community, has undertaken a serious peace initiative for somalia. igad has mandated the three frontline states of kenya, djibouti 23 and ethiopia, under the chairmanship of his excellency president daniel arap moi of kenya, to work out the modalities and time frames for completing the arta peace process. this has the support of the current chairman of igad, his excellency mr. omer al-bashir, president of the republic of sudan, and the heads of state of other igad countries. the igad process for the completion of the arta process has streamlined the various and often conflicting initiatives for the first time. igad has announced that a conference for the completion of the reconciliation process will be held in kenya on 15 october 2002. the transitional national government will participate. we will participate with an open mind and with the interest of the somali people as our foremost priority. the transitional national government will spare no effort to make the national reconciliation conference a success. we are gratified that the international community has recognized that the arta peace process continues to be the most viable basis for peace and national reconciliation in somalia. it is our hope that those regional administrations and other parties that have been outside the arta process will share our vision for peace and stability in somalia. in this regard, it is of critical importance that the international community send a clear message to all the somali participants to support the igad-sponsored conference in kenya, making clear that those who try to sabotage it or refuse to participate will be sanctioned by the international community. equally important is the issue of guarantees for the outcome of the reconciliation conference. we believe and request that the international community should put in place regional and international measures guaranteeing both the finality and the legality of the outcome of the conference in kenya. the international and regional guarantees must ensure that sanctions will be imposed on any somali group that rejects the outcome of the reconciliation conference in kenya. when the somali parties agree on a peace framework during the october conference in kenya, there will be an urgent need for international peacekeepers. there will also be an urgent need for disarmament and for the rebuilding of national institutions in somalia. we urge the united nations to be ready for this and to plan to meet the new challenges of disarmament, the demobilization of militias and reconstruction. the wind of peace that is blowing across the african continent has finally reached somalia. as the transitional national government, we are committed to the re-emergence of a new somalia that is at peace with itself, its neighbours and the world. as a law- abiding state, we pledge to respect our obligations under the united nations charter and the constitutive act of the african union and to remain a partner for peace and development in our continent and throughout the world.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

history of russia and eastern europe. and he has written what is widely considered to be the definitive biography of stalin in three volumes, two of which have been published, and the third focused on world war ii and the years after he is in the midst of writing now. this conversation includes a response to my previous podcast episode with oliver stone that was focused on vladimir putin and the war in ukraine. stephen provides a hard-hitting criticism of putin and the russian invasion of ukraine, weighed and contextualized deeply in the complex geopolitics and history of our world, all with an intensity and rigor, but also wit and humor that makes stephen one of my favorite human beings. please also allow me to mention something that has been apparent and has weighed heavy on my heart and mind. this conversation with stephen cotkin makes it more dangerous for me to travel in russia. the previous conversation with oliver stone makes it more dangerous for me to travel in ukraine. this makes me sad, but it is the way of the world. i will nevertheless travel to both ukraine and russia. i need to once again see with my own eyes the land of my ancestors, where they suffered but flourished and eventually gave birth to silly old me. i need to hear directly the pain, anger, and hope from both ukrainians and russians. i won't give details to my travel plans in terms of location and timing, but the trip is very soon. whatever happens, i'm truly grateful for every day i'm alive and i hope to spend each such day adding a bit of love to the world. i love you all. this is the lux freedman podcast, and now, dear friends, here's stephen cotkin. you are one of the great historians of our time specializing in the man, the leader, the historical figure of stalin. so let me ask a challenging question. if you can perhaps think about the echo of 80 years between joseph stalin and vladimir putin, what are the similarities and differences between the man and the historical figure, the historical trajectory of stalin and putin? thank you, lex. it's very nice to be here again with you. it's been a while. good to see you. yeah, good to see you as well. you're looking good. i see this podcast stuff is doing you right. so we can't really put very easily vladimir putin in the same sentence with joseph stalin. stalin is a singular figure, and his category is really small. hitler, mao, that's really about it. and even in that category, stalin is the dominant figure, both by how long he was in power and also by the amount of power, the military industrial complex he helped build and commanded. so putin can't be compared to that. however, putin's in the same building as stalin. he uses some of the same offices as stalin used. and some of those television broadcasts that we see of putin at meetings and putin inside the kremlin, stalin used to sit in those rooms and hold meetings in those rooms. that's the imperial senate built by catherine the great, an 18th century building inside the kremlin. it's a domed building, and you can see it on the panorama, the top of the building, at least you can see it on the panorama when you look over the kremlin wall from many sites inside moscow. so if he's not comparable to stalin, he still works, as i said, in those same buildings, those same offices partly. and so therefore, he's got some of the problems that stalin had, which was managing russian power in the world from a position of weakness vis-a-vis the west, but from an ambition, a grandiosity, in fact. and so this combination of weakness and grandeur, of not being as strong as the west, but aspiring to be as great or greater than the west, that's the dilemma of russian history for the past many centuries. it was the dilemma for the czars. it was the dilemma for peter the great. it was the dilemma for alexander. it was the dilemma for stalin, and it's the dilemma for putin. russia is smaller now compared to when stalin was in that kremlin. it's got pushed back to borders almost the time of peter the great. it's farther from the main european capitals now than any time since that 18th century. and the west has only grown stronger in that period of time. so the dilemma is greater than ever. the irony of being in that position, of sitting in the kremlin, trying to manage russian power in the world, trying to be a providential power, a country with a special mission in the world, a country which imagines itself to be a whole civilization and yet not having the capabilities to meet those aspirations and falling farther and farther behind the west. the irony of all of that is the attempted solutions put russia in a worse place every single time. so you try to manage the gap with the west. you try to realize these aspirations. you try to raise your capabilities and you build a strong state, the quest to build a strong state and use coercive modernization to try somehow, if not to close the gap with the west, at least to manage it. and the result is different versions of personalist rule. so they don't build a strong state. they build a personal dictatorship. they build an autocracy. and moreover, that autocracy undertakes measures which then worsen the very geopolitical dilemma that gave rise to this personalist rule in the first place. and so i call this russia's perpetual geopolitics. i've been writing about this for many, many years. what's important about this analysis is this is not a story of eternal russian cultural proclivity to aggression. it's not something that's in the mother's milk. it's not something that can't be changed. russia doesn't have an innate cultural tendency to aggression. this is a choice. it's a strategic choice to try to match the power of the west which from russia's vantage point is actually unmatchable. but it's a choice that's made again and again, and putin has made this choice just as stalin made the choice. stalin presided over the world war ii victory and then he lost the peace. after he died in 1953, there was of course other rulers who succeeded him. he was still the most important person in the country after he died because they were trying to manage that system that he built and more importantly, manage that growing gap with the west. by the time the 90s rolled around, former soviet troops, now russian troops, withdrew from all those advanced positions that they had achieved as a result of the world war ii victory. and it was napoleon in reverse. they went on the same roads, but not from moscow back to paris, but instead from warsaw and from east berlin and from tallinn and riga and all the other places of former warsaw pact and former soviet republics in the baltic region. they went back to russia in retreat. and so stalin in the fullness of time lost the peace and putin in his own way, inheriting some of this, attempting to reverse it when, as i said, russia was smaller, farther away, weaker, the west was bigger and stronger and had absorbed those former warsaw pact countries and baltic states because they voluntarily begged to join the west. the west didn't impose itself on them. it's a voluntary sphere of influence that the west conducts. and so that dilemma is where you can put putin and stalin in the same sentence and the terrible outcome for russia in the fullness of time also has echoes. but of course, putin hasn't murdered 18 to 20 million people and the scale of his abilities to cause grief with the nuclear weapons aside is nothing stalin's. and so we have to be careful, right? only mao put bigger numbers on the board from a tragic point of view than stalin. and numbers matter here. if we compare these singular figures. yeah, mao killed more people than stalin because mao had more people to kill. the most amazing thing about mao is he watched stalin do it. he watched stalin collectivize agriculture and famine result. he watched stalin impose this communist monopoly and all of those people sent to prison or given a bullet in the back of the neck. he watched all of that and then he did it again himself in china. do you think he saw the human cost directly that when you say he saw, do you think he was focused on the policies or was he also aware distinctly as a human being of the human costs in the lives of peasants and the lives of the working class and the lives of the poor? i think the prima facie evidence is that he didn't value human life. otherwise, i don't think after seeing the amount of lives that were taken in the soviet experiment, he would have done something similar after that. i think the answer lex is it's very hard to get inside mao's head and figure out what he was really thinking. but if you just look at the results that happened, the policies that were undertaken and the consequences of them, you would have to conclude that there was, let's say no value or little value placed on human life. unfortunately, that's characteristic not only of communist dictators, of post-communist dictators as well, but the scale of the horrors that they inflict as horrific as they are just can't compare. and so we're in a situation where eurasia, that is to say the ancient civilizations of eurasia, which would be russia, iran, china, all have some version of non-democratic, illiberal autocratic regimes. and they're all pushing up against the greater power of the west in some form. sometimes they coordinate their actions and sometimes they don't. but this is a very long standing phenomenon lex that predates vladimir putin or xi jinping or the latest incarnation of the supreme leader in iran. so we'll talk about this, i think really powerful framework of five dimensions of authoritarian regimes that you've put together. but first, let's go to this napoleon and reverse retreat from warsaw back. putin has called from the perspective of putin, this retreat, this collapse of stalin is one of the great tragedies of that region of russia. do you think there's a sense where as putin sits now in power for 22 plus years, he really dreams of a return to the power, the influence, the land of stalin. so while you said that they're not in the same place in terms of the numbers of people that suffer due to their regime, do you think he hopes to have the same power, the same influence for a nation that was in the 30s, in the 40s, in the 50s of the 20th century under stalin? if he does, lex, he's deluding himself. we don't know for sure, very few people talk to him, very few people have access to him. a handful of western leaders have met with him for short periods of time. those inside russia barely meet with him, his own minions in the regime barely have face time with him. we don't know exactly what he thinks. it could be that he has delusions of reconquering russian influence, if not direct control over the territories that broke away, but it's not gonna happen. let's talk a little bit about this guy, nikolai pothrushev. nikolai pothrushev is probably not well known to your listeners. he's the head of russia's security council. and so you could probably call him the second most important or second most powerful man in russia, certainly inside the regime. arguably, navalny is the second most important person in the country, and we'll talk about that later, i'm sure. in terms of influence, yes. yes, but pothrushev is a version of putin's right-hand man. and pothrushev has been giving interviews in the press. you probably saw the interview with nizhnevismaya gazeta not that long ago. he writes also his own blog- interventions in the public sphere using the few channels that are left. and what's interesting about pothrushev, and this could well reflect similar thinking to putin's, which is why i'm bringing this up, is that he's got this conspiratorial theory that the west has been on a forever campaign to destroy russia, just it destroyed the soviet union, and that everything the west does is meant to dismember russia, and that russia is fighting an existential battle against the west. and so, for example, the cia and the american government wanted to bring down the soviet union, never mind that the bush administration, the first bush, the father, was trying desperately to hold the soviet union together because they were afraid of the chaos that might ensue and the nukes that might get loose as a result of a soviet collapse. and it was until the very last moment where bush decided, his administration decided, to back those republican leaders who were breaking away from mikhail gorbachev and the soviet union, right? so never mind the empirics of it. never mind that bill clinton's administration, following george bush, sent boatloads of money, western taxpayer money, to russia. we don't know exactly how much because it came from different sources. people talk about how there was no marshall plan. it was tens of billions of dollars from various sources, from the imf and other sources. and, lex, it disappeared. it's gone. just the german money that went to gorbachev for unification disappeared even before the soviet collapse. the money disappeared. but the west sent the money. so how was that a plot? and then you could go all the way. obama's administration, george bush trying to do business deals and reset the relations, and obama administration trying to reset the relations and doing nothing after the georgian war and slapping putin on the wrist, following the seizure force of putin. and you could go on and you could go on all the way through the trump administration, telling putin that he's right, trump believes putin and doesn't believe us intelligence about russian efforts to interfere in american domestic politics. so despite all the empirics of it, you have patrushev and likely putin talking about this multi-decade western conspiracy to bring russia down. at the same time as that's happening, the germans are voluntarily increasing their dependence on russian energy, voluntarily increasing their dependence on russia. so here's the conspiracy to bring russia down. the french, who fantasize about themselves as a diplomatic superpower, are constantly, the french leaders are constantly running to the kremlin to ask what russia needs, what concessions from the west russia needs to feel respected again. the british provide all manner of money laundering and reputation laundering services for the whole russian oligarchy, including the state officials, who are looting the state and using the west, british institutions, to launder their money. so all of this is happening, and yet patrushev imagines this conspiracy to bring russia down by the west. and so that's what we've got in the kremlin again. stalin had that same conspiratorial mentality of the west. everything that happened in the world was part of a western conspiracy directed against the soviet union and now directed against russia. even though the west is trying to appease, the west is offering its services, the west is trying to change russia through investment in a positive way, but instead the west is what's changing. the west is becoming more corrupt. western services are being corrupted by the relationship with russia. so you have to ask yourself, who are these people in power in the kremlin who imagine that while they're availing themselves of every service and every blandishment of the west, while they're availing themselves of this, that they're fighting a conspiracy by the west to bring them down. so this is what they call the abizhnia in russian, which is a term as you know, that means those who are resentful or you might call them the losers, the losers in the transition. so when the soviet union fell and there was a diminishment, a very substantial diminution in russian power and influence in the world, a lot of people lost out. they weren't able to steal the property. they weren't able to loot the state in the 90s and they were on the outside. they gradually came back in. they were the losers in the transition domestically and for them, right, they wanted to reverse being on the losing side. and so they began to expropriate, to steal the money, steal the property from those first thieves who stole in the 90s and the 2000s and on have been about re-stealing, taking the losers in the transition, taking the money from the winners and reversing this resentment, this loser status. those are your patrushevs and your putins, but at the same time, this blows out to let's reverse the losses being on the losing side, the roiling resentment at the decline of their power internationally. let's try to reverse that too. so you have a profound psychological, whole generation of people who are on the losing end domestically and reverse that domestically. that's what the putin regime is about. remember, mikhail khodorkovsky's yukos. remember all the companies that are now owned by putin cronies because they were taken away from whoever stole them in the first place. and now they're trying to do that on the international scale. it's one thing to put domestic opponents in jail. it's one thing to take away someone's property domestically, but you're not gonna reverse the power of the west with the diminished russia that you have. and so that project, that patrushev project, which we see him expressing again and again, he speaks about it publicly. it's not something that we need to go looking for a quest, the secret, we can't find it. what are they thinking? it's right there in front of our face. and putin has spoken the same way for a long time. people point to the 2007 speech at the munich security conference that putin delivered, and certainly your listeners could use a snippet or two of that, just they could use a couple of quotes from patrushev to contextualize what we're talking about. but it predates the 2007 munich speech, the reaction to ukraine's uprising in 2004, attempt to steal the election inside ukraine, which the ukrainian people rose up valiantly against and risked their lives and overturned. so there were public statements from putin already back then, the statements about hrachkovsky in 2003 when he was arrested and expropriated. this is a longstanding, deeply psychological issue, which is about managing russian power in the world, as i was saying, the gap with the west, but has this further dimension of feeling losers and wanting to reverse that. that's their life experience. abizhanaya, so there's that resentment that fuels this narrative, fuels this geopolitics and internal policy. but so resentment is behind some of the worst things that have ever been done in human history. hitler was probably fueled by resentment. so resentment is a really powerful force, yes. just to maybe not push back, but to give fuller context on the west. you said there's a narrative from putin's russia that the west is somehow an enemy, you position everything against the west. but is there a degree, and to what degree, is the west willing to feed that narrative? that it's also convenient for the west to have an enemy? it seems in the place, in the span, it seems in geopolitics, having an enemy is useful for forming a narrative. now, having an enemy for the basic respect of humanity is not good, but in terms of maintaining power, if you're a leader in a game of geopolitics, it seems to be good to have an enemy. it seems to be good to have something a cold war. we can always point your finger and say, all our actions are fighting this evil, whatever that evil is. it could be with george w. bush, the war on terror, terrorism is this evil. you can always point at something. so you've made it seem that the west is trying. there's a lot of forces within the west that are trying to reach out a friendly hand, trying to help, sending money, sending compassion, trying to sort of... trying to integrate russia into global institutions, which was a longstanding multi-decade effort across multiple countries and multiple administrations in those countries. but is there also warmongers on the west? of course, lex, of course you're right about that, but let's put it this way. people talk about the cold war, and they're usually looking to assign blame for the cold war, as if it's some kind of mistake, a misunderstanding, or a search for an enemy that was convenient to rally domestic politics. so lex, there's a coup in czechoslovakia and somebody installs a communist regime in february, 1948. no reaction to that, that's just okay. there's a blockade of berlin. is that cool by you? where they try to strangle west berlin so that they can swallow west berlin and add it to east berlin. you cool with that? how about korean war, invasion of north korea, invasion of south korea by north korea? you cool with that? how about the murders and the show trials up and down eastern europe in the late 40s after the imposition of the clone regimes? you good with that? yeah, it's very convenient to have an enemy. i agree with you. but there were some actions, lex. there were some threats to people's freedom. there was some invasions. there was some aggression and violence on a mass scale, collectivization of eastern europe. we could go on, lex, with the examples. i'm just giving a few of them. and so the cold war was not a mistake. it was not a misunderstanding. we don't have to blame someone for the cold war. we have to give credit for the cold war. the truman administration deserves credit for standing up to stalin's regime, for standing up to these actions, for saying, yeah, we're not just gonna take this. we're not gonna let this go on. we're not gonna let this expand to further territories. we're gonna create the nato alliance. and we're gonna rally democratic liberal regimes to stand up to this illiberalism, this violence and this aggression. and so, yeah, lex, it's always convenient to have an enemy. but there was an enemy. nikolai leonov, who recently died, he died in april, 2022, and he had a major funeral. he was the last head analyst of the soviet kgb. and leonov is one of the most important figures for understanding the soviet collapse. and he has the best memoir on the soviet collapse, which is known in russian as likho letye. you will understand that. and you'll help your podcast listeners understand. there's a singularity to that kind of expression, likho letye. leonov just died. but one of the things, and in fact, the people who were supposedly arrested by putin as scapegoats for the ukraine war, the main one, sergei beseda, gave the eulogy at leonov's funeral in april, 2022, showing that it's a lie, that all of these people have been arrested and purged and other nonsense in social media. but to get back to what leonov said and get back to your enemy point, leonov said, you know, the west spent all this time blackening the image of the soviet union, all these resources and propaganda and covert operations to blacken the soviet image. and they did, lex, the west did do that. and then leonov wrote in the next sentence, and you know what? we gave them a lot of material to work with to blacken our image. yeah, so you're saying a kind of sobering, sobering reality, which it is possible to some degree to draw a line between the good guys and the bad guys. freedom is better than unfreedom, lex. it's a lot better than unfreedom, and a guy you understands that really well. well, so yes, but those are all, you know, there's words justice, freedom. what else? love, you can use a lot of words that hitler himself used to describe why he is actually creating a better world than those he's fighting. so some of it is propaganda. the question is on the ground, what is actually increasing the amount of freedom in the world? institution, lex, right? we're not talking about propaganda here. when we use words freedom, we're talking about rule of law. we're talking about protection of civil liberties. we're talking about protection of private property. we're talking about an independent and well-funded judiciary. we're talking about an impartial, non-corrupt, competent civil service. we're talking about separation of powers where the executive branch's power is limited, usually by an elected parliament. in fact, yes, let's talk about elections. let's talk about freedom of speech and freedom of the public sphere. we're not talking about freedom as a slogan here. we're talking about a huge array of institutions and practices and norms ultimately, right? and if they exist, you know and you live under them. and if they don't exist, you fully understand that as well, right? ukraine was a flawed democracy before russia invaded. it is utterly corrupt, many ways dysfunctional, especially the elites were dysfunctional. the gas industry in ukraine was absolutely terrible because of the corruption that it generated, the oligarch problem, a handful of people stealing the state resources. and yet ukraine had an open public sphere and it had a parliament that functioned. and so despite its flaws, it was still a democracy. the regime in moscow, you can't say that, lex. it's not a comparable regime to ukraine. you could say, , well, there were oligarchs in ukraine and there are oligarchs in russia. there's corruption in ukraine, there's corruption in russia. so really what's the big difference? and the answer is, well, ukraine had the open public sphere. ukraine had a real parliament. can you call russia's duma a real parliament? i don't think so. i don't think you can. can you say that there were any checks whatsoever on the executive branch in russia? can you say that the russian judiciary had any independence or really full level of competence even compared to the ukrainian judiciary, which was nothing to brag about? no, you can't say that, lex. so we can differentiate between the very flawed, corrupt, oligarchic democracy in ukraine and the very corrupt, oligarchic autocracy in russia. i think that's a fair distinction. yeah, we should say that russia and ukraine have the great honor of being the number one and the number two most corrupt nations in europe by many measures. but there is a fundamental difference, as you were highlighting. russia is a corrupt, corrupt country. russia is a corrupt autocracy. ukraine, we can say, is a corrupt democracy. and to that level, there's a fundamental difference. ukraine is not murdering its own journalists in systematic fashion. if journalists are killed in ukraine, it's a tragedy. if journalists are killed in russia or russian journalists are killed abroad, it's regime policy. and the degree to which a nation is authoritarian means that it's suffocating its own spirit, its capacity to flourish. we're not just talking about sort of the freedom of the press, those kinds of things, but basically all industries get suffocated and you're no longer being able to, yeah, flourish as a nation, grow the production, the gdp, the scientists, the art, the culture, all those kinds of things. yes, lex, you're absolutely right. and so before the invasion, the full-blown invasion of february, 2022 into ukraine, because as you know, the war has been going on for many years at a lower level compared to what it is these days, but still a tragic war with many deaths prior to february, 2022. before this latest war, we could have said that the greatest victims of the putin regime are russian, domestic, that the people who are suffering the most from the putin regime are not sitting here in new york city, but in fact, they're sitting there in russia. now, of course, with the invasion of ukraine and really the atrocities that have been well-documented and more are being investigated, we can't easily say anymore that russians are the greatest victims of the putin regime. but in ways other than bombing and murdering civilians, children, mothers, grandmothers, grandfathers, after you include that, then of course the larger number of victims of the putin regime are not ukrainians, but ultimately russians. and there's how many of them now that have fled? so your powerful, precise, rigorous words are standing in a stark contrast, i would say, to my very recent conversation with oliver stone. and i would love you to elaborate to this agreement you have here with his words and maybe words of people john mearsheimer. the idea is that putin's hand in this invasion of 2022 was forced by the expansion of nato, the imperialist imperative of the united states and the nato forces. you disagree with this point in terms of placing the blame somehow on the invasion on forces larger than the particular two nations involved, but more on the geopolitics of the world that's driven by the most powerful military nation in the world, which is the united states. yeah, lex, so let's imagine that a tragedy has happened here in new york and a woman got raped. we know the perpetrator. they go to trial and oliver stone gets up and says, you know what, the woman was wearing a short skirt and there was no option but for the rapist to rape her. the woman was wearing lipstick or the woman was applying for nato membership and just had to be raped. there's, i mean, didn't want to rape her, but was compelled because of what she was doing and what she looked and the clothes she was wearing and the alliances that she was under international law signed by moscow, all the treaties that sovereign countries get to choose, whatever alliance they belong to, treaties that the un charter signed by russia, soviet union, the 1975 helsinki agreement signed by the soviet union, the 1990 charter of paris for a new europe signed by the soviet union, the 1997 nato-russia founding act signed by the russian government, the post-soviet russia, all of those documents signed by either the soviet regime or the russian regime, which is the legally recognized international inheritor, successor of the soviet state, all of those agreements are still in force and all of them say that countries are sovereign and can freely choose their foreign policy and what alliances they want to join. let's even go farther than that. i mean, you don't have to go farther than that, but let's go farther than that, lex. is an autocratic repressive regime that invades its neighbors in the name of its own security something new in russian history? did we not see this before? is this, does this not predate nato expansion? does this not predate the existence of nato? would oliver stone sit here in this chair and say to you, you know, they had to impose serfdom in the 17th century because nato expanded. they had no choice, their hands were tied. they were compelled to treat their own population slaves because, you know, nato expanded. i mean, i could go on through the examples of russian history that predate the existence, let alone the expansion of nato, where you have behavior, policies, actions, very similar to what we see now from the kremlin. and you can't explain those by nato expansion, can you? and so that argument doesn't wash for me because i have a pattern here that predates nato expansion. i have international agreements, founding documents signed by the kremlin over many, many decades acknowledging the freedom of countries to choose their alliances. and then i have this problem where when you rape somebody, it's not because they're wearing a short skirt, it's because you have raped them. you've committed a criminal act, lex. that's, i think there's a lot of people listening to this that will agree to the emotion, the power, and the spirit of this metaphor. i was struggling to think how to dance within this metaphor because it feels it wasn't precisely the right one, but i think that it captures the spirit. i'm not suggesting, lex, that everything the west has done has been honorable or intelligent. fortunately, we live in a democracy, we live in liberal regimes, we live under rule of law, liberal in the classical sense of rule of law, not liberal in the leftist sense. we live in places that and we can criticize ourselves and we can criticize the mistakes that we made or the policy choices or the inactions that were taken. and there are a whole lot of things to answer for. and you can now discuss the ones that are your favorites, the dishonor or the mistakes, and i could discuss mine, and we could spend the whole rest of our meeting today discussing the west's mistakes and problems. and we won't end up in prison for it. yeah, lex, and so i'm thankful for that. and i'm thankful that people may disagree and that people make the argument that nato expansion is to blame. but you see, i'm countering two arguments here. i'm countering one argument, which is very deeply popular, pervasive, about how russia has this cultural tendency to aggression. and it can help, but invade its neighbors and it does it again and again. and it's eternal russian imperialism and you have to watch out for it. this very popular argument in the baltic states, it's really popular in warsaw. it's really popular with the liberal interventionists and it's very, very popular with those who were part of the iraq war squad that got us into that mess. so i'm against that. and the reason i'm against it is because it's not true. it's empirically false. there is no cultural trait, inherent tendency for russia to be aggressive. it's a strategic choice that they make. every time it's a choice made, it's not some kind of momentum. every time it's a choice that we should judge for the choice that it is for the decision. and therefore they could make different choices. they could say, we don't have to stand up to the west. we don't have the capabilities to do that. we can still be a great country. we can still be a civilization unto itself. we can still be russia. we can still worship in orthodox cathedrals. we can still be ourselves, but we don't have to pursue this chimerical pursuit this elusive quest to stand up to the west and be in the first ranks of powers. so i'm countering that argument. i'm saying it's perpetual geopolitics. it's a geopolitical choice rising out of this dilemma of the mismatch between aspirations and capabilities. it's not eternal russian imperialism. and i'm also countering the other argument here, lex, which is to say that it's the west's fault. it's western imperialism. i'm very popular on the left, very popular with realist scholars, very popular with some of the people recently on your podcast. and so it's neither eternal russian imperialism, nor is it western imperialism, right? the mere fact that the west is stronger than russia is not a crime on the part of the west. it's not a crime that countries voluntarily wanna join the west that beg to get in, either the eu or nato or other bilateral alliances or other trade agreements. those are voluntarily entered into, and that's not criminal. if the west's sphere of influence, which is open, an open sphere of influence, which as i say, people voluntarily join, if that expands, that's not a crime, nor is that a threat to russia, ipso facto, right? nato is a defensive alliance, and the countries that are largely pacifists who are members of nato. and nato doesn't attack, it defends members if they are attacked. and so the idea that ukraine, which had the legal right, might wanna join nato in the eu, which was not gonna happen in our lifetimes and was not a direct threat to the putin regime since the western countries that make up the eu and nato, decided that ukraine was not ready for membership, there was no consensus, it was not gonna happen, but it's ukraine's free choice to express that desire. and if your government is elected by your people, freely elected, meaning you can unelect that government in the next election, and that government makes foreign policy choices on the basis of its perceived interests, that's not a crime lex, that's not a provocation, that's not something that compels the leader of another country to invade you, right? that is legal under international law, and it's also a realist fact of life. the realists to tell you that russia here was disrespected, russia's interests were not taken into account, et cetera, et cetera, but the real world works in such a way that treaties matter, that international law matters, that's why people me were not in favor of the us 2003 invasion of iraq, lex, because it wasn't legal, in addition to the fact that we thought it might backfire. but you know, lex, i said, there are a lot of things about the west that we ought to criticize as citizens, and we do criticize, but we have to be clear about where responsibility lies in these events that we're talking about today. so you get into trouble, it's largely erroneous to think about both the west or the united states from an imperialist perspective, and russia from an imperialist perspective, it's better, clearer to think about each individual aggressive decision on its own as a choice, that was made. so let's talk about the most recent choice made by vladimir putin. the choice to invade ukraine, or to escalate the invasion of ukraine on february 24th, 2022. now we're a few months removed from that decision, initial decision. why do you think he did it? what are the errors in understanding the situation and calculating the outcomes, and everything else about this decision, in your view? yeah, lex, when a war doesn't go well, it looks lunacy to have launched it in the first place. does it ever go well? war never goes according to plan. all war is based upon miscalculation, but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation. all aggressive war we're talking about, not defensive war, is based upon miscalculation. but you can adjust, you can recalibrate. when you're driving down the road and that very annoying voice is telling you in a thousand feet, make a right, and you fail to make a right, it recalibrates, right? it tells you, okay, now go turn around, or u-turn, or make a left. it doesn't say you're an idiot and turn around and make a u-turn, but it does recalibrate. so you can miscalculate, and the problem is not the miscalculation usually, it's the failure to do that adjustment, right? people i know who are hedge fund traders, i asked them, you know, what's your favorite trade? and the line from them all, and this is a cliche, is my favorite trade is when i made a mistake, but i got out early before all the carnage. so their favorite trade is not when they made some brilliant choice, but it's when they miscalculated, but they reduce the consequences of their miscalculation by recalibrating quickly, right? so let's talk about the calculation and miscalculation of february. let's imagine, lex, that you've been getting away with murder. i don't mean murder in a figurative sense. i mean, you've been murdering people. you've been murdering them domestically, and you've been murdering them all across europe, and you've been murdering them, not just with, for example, a car accident, a staged car accident, or using a handgun. you use novichoke, or you use some other internationally outlawed chemical weapon. and let's imagine that you did it, and nothing happened to you. it wasn't you were removed from power. it wasn't you paid a personal price. sure, maybe there was some sanctions on your economy, but you didn't pay the price of those sanctions. little people paid the price of those sanctions. other people in your country paid the price. let's imagine not only were you murdering people, literally, but you decided to entice the idiotic ruler of georgia into a provocation that you could then invade the country. and you invaded the country, and you bit off these territories, abkhazia and south ossetia, and what price did you pay for that? and then you decided, you know, i think i'll now invade crimea, and forcibly annex crimea, and i'll instigate an insurrection in the donbas, in eastern ukraine. in luhansk and donbas, let's imagine you did all that, and then you had to stick out your wrist so that, you know, it could be slapped a couple of times. and you said, you know, i can pretty much do what i want. they're putting a sanction here and there, and they're doing this and they're doing that, and you know what? they're more energy dependent on me than before. i got better money laundering and reputation services than anybody has. maybe the middle east and the chinese would disagree with you that you have better than them, but yours are pretty good. and the panama papers get released, revealing all of your offshoring and your corruption, and what happened? nothing happens, lex. so the first and most important consideration here is, in your own mind, you've been getting away with murder, literally, as well as figuratively, and you think, you know, i probably have a better life and you think, you know, i probably can do something again and get away with it. and so the failure to respond at scale, in fact, the indulgences, the further dependencies that are introduced, the illusion that trade is the mechanism to manage authoritarian regimes. you know, that great german cliché, a vandell durch handel, right, change through trade or transformation through trade, one of angela merkel's favorite expressions, right? you're going to get the other side to be better, rather than confront them in a cold war fashion where you stand up to their aggressions and you punish them severely in order to deter further behavior. so that's the first and most important part of the calculation miscalculation. there are a lot of other dimensions. can we pause on that really quick? so this is kind of idea of it's okay to crack a few eggs to make an omelet, which is a more generous description of what you're saying, that you don't incorporate into the calculation the amount of human suffering that the decisions cause, but instead you look at sort of the success based on some kind of measure for you personally and for the nation, not in terms of in the humanitarian sense, but in some kind of economic sense and a power, geopolitical power sense. yeah. you're not sentimental, alex. you say to yourself, the cause of russian greatness is greater than any individual life. russia being in the first rank of the great powers, russia realizing its mission to be a special country with a special mission in the world, a civilization unto itself, the first rank of the great powers, maybe even the greatest power. that's worth the price that we have to pay, especially in other people's lives, right? we have a lot of literature on the putin regime, which talks about the kleptocracy, the place is a kleptocracy, and it is a kleptocracy. we all can see that, and anybody in london living the high life servicing this kleptocracy can testify that it's a kleptocracy, and not only in london, of course, right here in the united states, in new york. but you know, it's not only a kleptocracy, alex. that was the problem of the russian studies literature. it wasn't just about stealing, looting the state. it was about russian greatness. you see those rituals in the kremlin, right in the grand kremlin palace, in the st. george's hall, some of the greatest interiors in the world, and you see award ceremonies, and you see marking holidays, and all of these looters of the state have their uniforms on with their medals, and someone's giving a speech or singing a ballad, and their eyes are moist. their eyes are moist because they're thieves and looters? no, alex, because they believe in russian greatness. they have a deep and fundamental, passionate commitment to the greatness of russia, which in unsentimental fashion, they're all sentimental to the max. that's why their eyes are moistening, but they imagine unsentimentally that any sacrifice is okay, a sacrifice of other people's lives, a sacrifice of their conscripts in the military, a sacrifice of ukrainian women and children and elderly. that's a small price to pay for those moist eyes about russian greatness and russia's position in the world. well, that human thing, that sentimentality, is the thing that can get us in trouble in the united states as well and lead us to wars, illegal wars and so on, but the united states, those are precautions for breaking the law. you're going to pay for illegal wars in the end. you're saying that in authoritarian regimes, this sentimentality can really get out of hand, and by charismatic leaders, they can take that to manipulate the populace, that in the span of history led to atrocities and in today's world lead to humanitarian crises. it's not just a kleptocracy, it's a belief system. it's passion, it's conviction. you can call them illusions, you can call them fantasies. whatever you want to call them, they're real. they're real for those people. and so, yes, they're looting that very state that they're trying to make one of the great powers in the world. and they resent the fact that the west doesn't acknowledge them as one of those great powers, and they resent that the west is more powerful. people talk about how putin doesn't understand the world and that he gets really bad information. lex, if you're sitting there in that kremlin and you're trying to conduct business in the world and you're getting reports from your finance minister or your central bank governor, your whole economy, everything that matters, somehow all your trade is denominated in dollars and euros. do you have any illusions about who controls the international financial system? i don't think so, lex. you're looking over your industrial plan for the next year, and you're looking over how many tanks you're going to get and how many cruise missiles you're going to get and how many submarines you're going to get and fill in the blank. and you know what? it says right there in the paperwork where the component parts come from, where the software comes from, comes from the west, lex. your whole military industrial complex is dependent on high-end western technology. and let's say you're in beijing, not just in moscow, and you go to a meeting in your own neighborhood. you're the leader of china. you go to a meeting with other asian leaders. do they all speak in chinese with you? no, lex, they don't speak chinese. you go to an international meeting as the leader of china, and guess what language is the main language of intercourse? yes, the same one you and i are speaking right now. and so you live in that world. you live in the western world, and it's very hard to have illusions about what world you live in when you're under that, you need those western banks. you need that foreign currency, right? you need that high-end western technology, that technology transfer. you're speaking or you're forced to speak or your minions are forced to speak at international gatherings in english. and i could go on. all the indicators that you live in, and so putin lives in that world. he's no fool. well, to push back, isn't it possible that, as you said, the minions operate in that world? but can't you, if you're the leader of russia or the leader of china or the leader of these different nations, still put up walls where actually when you think in the privacy of your mind, you exist not in the international world, but in a world where there's this great russian empire or this great chinese empire, and then you forget that there's english, you forget that there's technology in iphones, you forget that there's all this us keeps popping up on all different paperwork, that just becomes the blurry details that dissipate, because what matters is the greatness of this dream empire that i have in my mind as a dictator. i would put it this way, lex. after you absorb all of that from your minions and it impresses upon your consciousness where you live, you live in a western-dominated world, that the multipolar world doesn't exist. your goal is to make that multipolar world exist. your goal is to bring down the west. your goal is for the west to weaken. your goal is a currency other than the dollar and the euro. your goal is an international financial system that you dominate. your goal is technological self-sufficiency made in china 2035. your goal is a world that you dominate, not that the west dominates, and you're going to do everything you can to try to attain that world, which is a russian-centric world or a chinese-centric world or what we could call a eurasian-centric world. and it's not going to be easy, lex, just for the reasons that we enumerated before. but maybe you're going to get a helping hand. maybe the west is going to transfer their best technology to you. they're going to sell you their best stuff. and then you're going to absorb it and maybe copy it and reverse engineer it. and if they won't sell it to you, maybe you'll just have to steal it. maybe the west is going to allow you to bank, even though you violate many laws that would prohibit the west from extending those banking services to you. maybe the west is going to buy your energy and your palladium and your titanium and your rare metals lithium, because you're willing to have your poor people mine that stuff and die of disease at an early age, but western governments, they don't want to do that. they don't want to do that dirty mining of those very important rare earths. but you're willing to do that because it's just people whose lives you don't care about as an autocratic regime. that's the world you live in where you're trying to get to this other world. you're at the center of the other world. you dominate the other world. but the only way to get there, lex, is the west has to weaken, divide itself, maybe even collapse. and so you're encouraging, to the extent possible, western divisions, western disunity, western lack of resolve, western mistakes and western invasion of the wrong country and western destruction of its credibility through international financial crises. one could go on. so if the west weakens itself through its mistakes and its own corruption, you're going to survive and maybe even come out into that world where you're the center. and so russia's entire grand strategy, just china's grand strategy, iran, it's hard to say they have a grand strategy because they're so profoundly weak. but russia's grand strategy is we're a mess. we don't invest in our human capital. our human capital flees, or we actually drive it out. it goes to mit, you did, or it goes to fill in the blank. we can't invest in our people. our health care is terrible. our education system is in decline. we don't build infrastructure, lex. we don't improve our governance. we don't invest in those attributes of modern power that make the west powerful. we can't because when we try, the money is stolen. we try these grandiose projects of national projects, they're called. we're going to invest in higher ed. we're going to invest in high tech. we're going to build our own silicon valley known as skolkovo. we're going to do all those things and what happens? they can't even build an airport without the money disappearing. the sochi olympics, lex, it cost them, officially cost them $50 billion. you look around at the infrastructure that endured from that $50 billion expense, and you're thinking, you know, that's the second avenue subway. you get almost nothing for your money. and so, yeah, it's corruption, lex, but it's also because they don't want to do that. they don't want to invest in their people. they couldn't do it if they wanted to, and when they try, it doesn't work. but why invest in your own people? invest in your hardware, your military hardware. invest in your cyber capabilities. invest in all your spoilation techniques and your hard power. and invest in further corrupting and further weakening and further dividing the west. because as i said, if the west is weak, divided, lacking resolve, you don't invest in your people. you don't build infrastructure. you don't improve your governance, but you'll muddle through. that's russian grand strategy. so invest in the hard power, weaken the west. those combined together means you're going to be heavily incentivized to escalate any military aggressive conflicts that are around you or create new ones or... if you can get away with murder. but what happens, lex, if it's a harry truman- response? what happens if somebody says, you know, we're going to stand up to this? we're not going to allow this to happen. we're not going to launder your money anymore. we're not going to be dependent on you for energy in the long term. we're going to make a transition. we're going to punish you for that kind of behavior instead. and the west has now switched to that only because of the courage and ingenuity of the ukrainian people. the ukrainian resistance to russian aggression was one of the greatest gifts the west has ever received. the sacrifices that the ukrainians are making right now as we speak, meaning they're fighting a war by themselves against a major military power, their neighbor russia. nobody's fighting it with them. yes, we are giving them weapons so they can conduct self-defense, which by the way is legal under international law. unlike the russian invasion, which is illegal under international law, western supply of weapons, including heavy weapons, including offensive weapons to ukraine for its self-defense in the invasion by russia, is actually legal under. and so thank god the ukrainians surprised everybody. they surprised me. they surprised putin in the kremlin. they surprised the biden administration. they surprised the european union, not with the fact that they would resist. we knew that. we had the orange revolution in 2004. we had maidan in 2013-14, where they rose up against a domestic tyrant, and they were willing to die on behalf of their country then, let alone against a foreign tyrant invading their country. so we knew they would resist. we didn't know just how successful, certainly i didn't know, they would be on the battlefield. it's been breathtaking to watch. that sacrifice, that gift enabled the west to rediscover itself, to rediscover its power, to revive itself, to say, the hell with this energy dependence in the long term, the hell with this money laundering and reputation laundering, the hell with this running back and forth to moscow to try to see what putin needs in order for him to feel respected, what appeasement he needs. so we'll see if it endures, but this shift comes from the ukrainians. and so it's no longer getting away with murder, lex, and we thank the ukrainians for that. the people and the leadership and the separate factions that make up ukraine uniting, it's the unification, the uniting against the common enemy, standing up, before anyone knew that they would be backed by all of these other nations, by this money and all this kind of stuff, standing there, especially with the president zelensky, where it makes total sense to flee, he stood his ground. let's take that point that you just raised, which is a deep and fundamental point, and i thank you for that. do you guys hear that? i think that was a compliment. there we go. let's go. so, let's hear unification. i'm sitting here in front of you. it's an honor. and it's a mutual honor. so, ukraine before the war is run by a tv production company. you're one guy running this fantastic, incredible podcast. there's 20 guys or so running a country the size of ukraine. and one's a producer and one's a makeup person and one's a video editor. and they're fantastically talented people if your country is a tv production. so, before the war, zelensky had what, 25 approval rating, and he couldn't get much done, and it wasn't working. he got elected with 73, as you know, and then he was down to 20. that's a pretty big drop. and so, you're thinking maybe having a major, large-sized, 40 million-plus population european country run by a tv production company is not the best choice. and then what do we see? we see president zelensky decides to risk his life on behalf of his country, ukraine. he decides to stay in the capital. he's not going to flee. they're going to stay and fight. and he could be killed. he can die. it's a decision where he put his life on the line. obviously, he's jewish descent, russian-speaking childhood and upbringing. russian-speaking jewish descent puts his life on the line for the country of ukraine. it's a pretty big message, don't you think? and it's crucial. and it turns out, not only that, lex, but they're good at tv. they're good at information war. and in a war, it's a tv production company and a tv personality. that's exactly what you want running a country, because they're crushing in the information war. and he's spectacular. european parliament, us congress, israeli parliament. there's no room on zoom, let alone in person, that he can't win over. he's just so effective. you know, this is the first time reality tv has been about reality instead of fake. reality tv is just this completely fake nonsense. but zelensky, this is real reality tv. and he means it. and the nation is behind him. and they're just as courageous and just as ingenious in many ways. and it's spectacular. and so, yeah, who saw that coming? i didn't see that coming, lex. in fact, the biden... we talk about putin's miscalculation. the biden administration, as you alluded to, offered him an exit from the country. they didn't say, you know, you want to stand and fight, we'll back you. they said, we'll get you out. you want to come now? and famously, you know that quote, right? what he said about how he doesn't need a ride. remember that moment? the biden administration was poised to do another afghanistan moment. that ignominious exit from afghanistan was almost what happened in ukraine when the biden administration offered him that ride out of there. and fortunately, he declined and helped rally. and the people from below also rallied to stop the invader without the presidency and without the government in ukraine, saving the biden administration and the european leaders who latched on. fortunately, they had the presence of mind to latch on to this gift, this bravery and ingeniousness of zelensky and the rest of the ukrainians, and flipped and decided to support ukraine's resistance. you know, first with 5,000 helmets only, as the germans initially promised, and now with really heavy weapons. and so that's something that wasn't foreseen. i certainly didn't foresee that. i foresaw the ukrainian society being courageous and resisting, but i didn't foresee a television production company being exactly what you want to run a country in a war, a president zelensky willing to sacrifice, lay down his life and rallying others in the country to do that. and then the country being so effective, not just at courage, but at battlefield resistance to the russian invasion. so i stand corrected by the ukrainians, and i'm ecstatic that i was proven wrong. and i said, there's clear factions of the west and the east of ukraine. and here's a person that, you said, was in the high 20s, low 30s percentage approval in the country before the war, and now was able to use in the 90s. he's in the 90 approval rating. i mean, i think they stopped doing the polling. once he hit 91 or whatever it was in the previous poll, i think they all understood that for now they didn't need any more polling, that it's pretty clear the nation. so 25 to 90-something percent. and just the 25 was deserved, the 90-something percent is also deserved, fully deserved. and the question is how that all stabilizes. it feels this set of events, i may be paying attention to twitter too much, which is a concern of mine, whether the change i see is just surface level or deep level. but it seems we're in a new world. there's something dramatic has shifted. that this power that's rooted, i mean, in your study of the 20th century, it's so deeply rooted in history. there's this power center of the world is now going to, has been shaken by this event. and how that changes the world is unclear. it's unclear what lesson china learns from watching this, what lesson india learns from watching this. both nations, as far as you can get polls about chinese population, but both nations are largely in support of putin. so russia, india, and china are still supporting of putin. quietly. i would maybe elaborate a little bit on that point, lex. i think you're right. the feeling that we're in an inflection moment, an inflection point, i think that's widespread. and i think it's widespread for good reason. we might be. but i also share your, let's say, modesty about where it's going and how hard it is to predict where this might go. it's only an inflection point if the trends continue, right? if the trends endure. there are plenty of non-inflection points. after 9-11, the whole world rallied around the united states. after it was attacked. after the bombing of the towers here in new york city and the hitting of the pentagon. and that didn't last. it was not really an inflection point, was it? it felt it might be, but it wasn't. and so this is not a comparable moment in terms of what happened, but it has the feeling that it might be a watershed. and maybe we'll squander it the way we squandered the post-9-11 rallying around the united states. maybe we'll actually consolidate it and it'll endure, or maybe it'll endure despite ourselves. and we can't tell and we can't know yet. and it depends in part on what we do and what we don't do. but here's a few things that we understand already. the idea that the west was in decline and that the rest of the world had risen and was more powerful and that we lived in a multipolar world, that turns out to be empirically false. it's not true. i mean, it's just factually not true. there are no major important multinational institutions, organizations that are run on behalf of or led by a south african, a nigerian person from india. even the chinese don't run these institutions. they would to and they're trying, but they don't. and so whatever you pick, the imf, the world bank, the federal reserve, which is the most powerful multinational institution, which is actually only a domestic institution and doesn't have a legal mandate to act multilaterally, but does. it's got the most power of any institution in the world. nato, the bilateral alliances that the us has up and down asia. what organizations that have tremendous leverage on the international system, on the international order, are non-western? the un is the most encompassing. and of course, we know that it has five members of the security council with a veto, one of which is russia, one of which is china, and the others are the us, britain and france, not india, not south africa, not indonesia, not all of these other countries where the people live, right? the bulk of the population of the world and where the population is growing on the african continent. so it's not a multipolar world. we talked already about the international financial system. that's the western, not multipolar. we talked about the us military in nato, or we could talk about the japanese military, which is just very formidable, enormous number of platforms. even the australian military, we could talk about, right? and so it's a western dominated world. and the west, remember, is not a geographic concept. it is an institutional and values club. the japanese are not european, but they're western, just russia is european, but not western, because european is a cultural category and western is an institutional category where you have rule of law and separation of powers and free and open public sphere and dynamic open market economy. okay. and then we have another thing which is pretty clear. the west is powerfully resented, powerfully envied and admired simultaneously. pj o'rourke, the comedian who died this year, fantastic. it was a big loss for the culture. he said there are two things that are always characteristic of any american embassy abroad. one is a political protest outside, and the other is the longest line you've ever seen for visas. and those things are true simultaneously. and that's the world we live in, meaning that non-western countries envy and admire the west, but they also resent the power of the west. western hypocrisy, right? the west invades countries when it wants, but when others do that, it's illegal, right? the west arrests you for money laundering, but it's western money laundering that is where you go when you need to launder money, right? so they see the hypocrisy, they see the excessive power that the west has, and they resent it. and they say, who elected you to run the world? we have a billion plus people, or we have 200 plus million people, and we don't have a say. you're the self-appointed guardians of our world. who did that? and so it's incumbent on the west not only to remember the power that it has, but also to exercise that power legally and with restraint, and also to think about how we can expand institutions to be more encompassing so that other parts of the world are not on the outside being dictated to, but instead are on the inside. too often, right, western power is not consultative in a decision-making fashion. it's consultative after the fact. okay, you know, we got together in the eu, or we got together in nato, or we got together at the federal reserve, and here's our decision, and we're announcing it today. and so your economy gets destroyed because the federal reserve decides it has to raise interest rates. or you now go into default. you can't pay your debt because western banks lent you money, and now the west has changed interest rates or other considerations, and you're in big trouble now. and so this is something which we fail to address. it's very hard to address. it's very hard to reform international institutions. it's very hard to share power. it's very hard to acknowledge that you have too much power and that maybe having too much power is not good, not only for the rest of the world, but for yourself. and so it's great to rediscover the west and rediscover its values and rediscover its authority and credibility and power, but that's not sufficient. so we know this now. we know that the rest of the world is not necessarily jumping on the western bandwagon to condemn russia for its actions because the west can do things sanction your central bank, take away your reserves, deny you technology. it pretty much can do whatever it wants, and it can say that it's legal and it can go through various mechanisms and it can freeze your property, and you say to yourself, should anybody have that much power and when do they come after me? now there's a caveat here, and the caveat lex is they don't the west having all of that power and they didn't join in the condemnation of russia, but they also didn't join in russia's aggression. so russia's domestic civilian aerospace, aircraft industry, civilian aircraft industry is in big trouble now because of the export controls on spare parts and software. brazil is a major power in aircraft manufacturing. did they rush in and say, you know, vladimir putin, we didn't condemn necessarily your actions in ukraine, okay, that's one thing, and how about we give you all of our aircraft technology and we help you rebuild your domestic aircraft industry, and you can have the aviation that the west is, did that happen lex? didn't happen. and you can look at india, and you can look at china, and you can look at south africa, and you can look at what they've done in practical terms. yes, they haven't always joined in a full-throated condemnation, maybe they've been neutral or maybe they've been playing both sides of the fence turkey, for example. but are they rushing in to join russia, to join russia's aggression, to supply, and the answer is no. and the answer is no for two reasons. one, they actually don't want to be party to that. and two, they understand that western power and they don't want to be on the receiving end by crossing the west and then getting caught up in a sanctions regime or worse. can we go to the mind of vladimir putin because what you just said, china, india, they seem to sit back and say, we're not going to condemn the actions of vladimir putin and russia, but we would really for this war to be over. so there's that kind of energy of, we don't just stop this because you're putting us in a very, very bad position. and yet, vladimir putin is continuing the aggression. what is he thinking? what information is he getting? is it the system that you've described of authoritarian regimes that corrupts your flow of information, your ability to make clearheaded decisions? just as a human being, when you go to sleep at night, is he not able to see the world clearly or is this all deliberate, systematic action that does have some reason behind it? we've got to talk a little bit about china too, but let's answer your putin question directly. so on twitter, you've lost the war. or as they say, there are these two russian soldiers having a smoke in warsaw. and they're taking a break having a smoke and they're sitting there in warsaw on top of their tank and one says to the other, yeah, we lost the information war. and there they are sitting in warsaw having that smoke. so yeah, on twitter, russia has completely lost the war. in reality, they failed to take kiev, they failed to capture kiev, and they failed in phase two, as they called it, or plan b, which is to capture the entirety of the donbas. we're three months into the war. if you had made a judgment about, let's say, the nazi invasion of the soviet union, a definitive judgment after three months, you might have got the outcome wrong there. if you had judged the winter war, the 1939-40 soviet invasion of finland, after three months, you would have got that wrong too of what the outcome was going to be. so we're early in the game here and we have to be careful about any definitive judgments. but it is the case that so far they failed to take kiev and they failed to capture the entirety of the donbas, luhansk and donetsk provinces, eastern ukraine, a part of eastern ukraine. and they've been driven out of kharkiv and the area immediately surrounding kharkiv. they never captured kharkiv, but they came close, but now the ukrainians drove them back to the russian border in that very large and important region. so those look battlefield losses that are impossible to explain away if you're the regime in russia, except by suppression of information. and as you know from russian history, leaders in russia have an easier time with a state of siege and deprivation than they do with explaining a lost war. but let's look at some other facts that are important to take into account. one, the russian army has penetrated farther into ukrainian territory since february 2022, including in kherson region, the famous mariupol siege that just ended. they have built a large presence in areas north of crimea on the sea of azov, the black sea, latoral, ultimately, that they didn't previously hold. they're still fighting in luhansk for full control over at least half of the donbas, and ukrainians are resisting fiercely. but nonetheless, you can say that they've been driven out, on the contrary, farther penetration than the beginning. ukraine doesn't have an economy anymore. they have somewhere between 33 and 50 percent unemployment. it's hard to measure unemployment in a war economy. but their metallurgical industry, that azov-style steel plant in mariupol, is a ruin now. and a lot of farmers are not planting the fields because the harvest from the previous year still hasn't been sent, sold abroad because the ports are blockaded or destroyed. and so you don't have an economy, and you need five billion or seven billion or eight billion dollars a month to meet your payroll, to feed your people, to keep your army in the field. that's a lot of money per month, and that's indefinite. that's as long as this blockade lasts. and so you don't have an economy anymore. you're indigent. and even if you take the lower number, five billion, as opposed to zelensky's ask for seven billion, five billion is 60 billion a year. that's 60 billion this year. that's 60 billion next year. and so who's got that kind of money? which western taxpayers are ready? and if you use the seven or eight billion, you get up to 100 billion a year. the biden just signed, president joe biden just signed the bill, making it law, $40 billion in aid to ukraine. it's just an enormous sum. the economic piece of that is a month and a half, two months of ukrainians covering ukrainian expenditures. that's it. and they're asking the g7, they're asking everybody for this. so you have no economy and no prospect of an economy until you evict the russians from your territory. and then you have a western unity, western resolve. it lasts or it doesn't last, lex. so you're president putin and you've got more territory than before. and you've got a stranglehold over the ukrainian economy. and you've got a lot of the world neutral and you've got the chinese propaganda supporting you to the hilt with those oliver stone and mearsheimer lines about how this is really nato's fault. and you've got hungary dragging its feet on the oil embargo against russia and you got turkey dragging its feet on the recent applications of sweden and finland for nato expanse. and you're saying to yourself, lex, maybe i can ride this out. i got a lot of problems of my own and we can go into the details on the russian side, the challenges. but he's got, he's on ukrainian territory unless he's evicted. and he's got a stranglehold on their economy. and he's got the possibility that the west doesn't stay resolved and doesn't continue to pay for ukraine's economy or supply those heavy weapons. and so you could argue that maybe he's deluded about all of this and maybe he should go on twitter. i'm not on twitter, but maybe putin, who famously doesn't use the internet, should go on twitter and cease losing the war. or you can argue that maybe he's calculating here that he's got a chance to still prevail. wow, that is darkly insightful. if i could go to henry kissinger for a brief moment and people should read this op-ed he wrote in the washington post in march 5th, 2014, after the start of the war between russia and ukraine, but before crimea was annexed. there's a lot of interesting historical description about the division within ukraine, the corruption within ukraine that will, if people read this article, give context to how incredible it is, what zelensky was able to accomplish in uniting the country. i just want to comment, because henry kissinger is an interesting figure in american history. he opens the article with, in my life, i have seen four wars begun with great enthusiasm and public support, all of which we did not know how to end and from three of which we withdrew unilaterally. the test of policy is how it ends, not how it begins. so he's giving this cold hard truth that we go into wars excited, are able to send $40 billion, financial aid, military aid, our own men and women, but the excitement fades. twitter outrage fades and then a country that's willing to wait patiently is willing to pay the cost of siege versus the cost of explaining to its own people that the war is lost, that country just might win, outlast. let's hope not, because the ukrainians resistance deserves to prevail here. russia deserves to lose. no war of aggression they've committed here against ukraine should prevail if we can do anything about it. i support a thousand percent the continued supply of heavy weapons, including offensive weapons to the ukrainians, as long as they're willing to resist and it's their choice. it's their choice when to negotiate. it's their choice how much to resist. it's their choice what kind of sacrifices to make. and it's our responsibility to meet their requests more quickly than we have so far and at greater scale. but ultimately wars only have political ends. they never have military ends. you need a political solution here. so if the ukrainians are able to conduct a successful counteroffensive at scale in july or august whenever they launch, right now the heavy weapons are coming in and they're being moved to the battlefield and more are coming. you know the dynamic. russia bombs a school. russia bombs a hospital. americans and europeans decide to send even more heavy weapons to ukraine. that's the self-defeating dynamic from the russian side. they commit the atrocities. we send more heavy weapons. once those heavy weapons are on the battle lines, we'll see if ukrainians cannot just defend, which they've proven they're able to do in breathtaking fashion, not just conduct counterattacks where the enemy moves forward and you cut behind the enemy's lines and you counterattack and push the enemy back a little bit. but whether you can evict the russians from your territory with a combined arms operation where you have a massive superiority in infantry and heavy weapons, but more importantly you coordinate your air power, your tanks, your drones, your infantry at scale, which is something the ukrainians have not done yet. it's something the russians failed at in ukraine and they come from the same place, the soviet military. we hope this ukrainian counter offensive at scale, this combined arms operation, succeeds and if it does succeed there's the possibility of a battlefield victory. whether that also includes crimea, which as you know is not hostile on the contrary to the russian military, remains to be seen. but however much they regain territorially back towards the 1991 borders, which is their goal, their stated goal, and which we support them properly in trying to achieve, however much they achieve of that in this counter offensive that we're anticipating, that will set the stage for the next phase. and either russia, which is to say one person, vladimir putin, will acknowledge that he's lost the war because the ukrainians won it on the battlefield, or he'll try to announce a full scale mobilization, conscript the whole country, go back and instead of acknowledging defeat, try to win with a different plan, recalibrate, remains to be seen. will the ukrainians negotiate any territory away or must they capture also crimea, which puts a very high bar on the summer counter offensive that we're going to see, which could last through the fall and into the winter as a result. we don't know the answers to that. nobody knows the answers to that. people are guessing. some people are better informed because they have inside intelligence. people are also worried about russian escalation to nuclear weapons or chemical weapons if they begin to lose on the battlefield to ukraine. are you worried about nuclear war, the possibility of nuclear war? i think it's necessary to pay attention to that possibility. that possibility existed before the february 2022 full blown invasion of ukraine. the doomsday arsenal that russia possesses is enough to destroy the world many times over. and that's been the case every year since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991. and so of course we're concerned about that. we do know, however, that they have a system known as dual key. dual key for their strategic nuclear weapons. strategic nuclear weapons means the ones fired from silos, the missiles, the ones delivered from bombers or the ones fired from submarines. and they're ready to go. they're intercontinental. we watch that very, very closely. we watch all the movement of that and the alerts, etc. we have tremendously, let's say, tremendous inside intelligence on that. but dual key means that president putin alone cannot fire them. he has one key, which he must insert. he must then insert the codes for a command to launch. that then goes to the head of the general staff, who must has his own key and separate codes and must do the same. insert that key and codes for them to launch. and so will the general staff chief go along with the destruction of the world over a battlefield loss in ukraine? i don't know the answer to that and i don't know if anybody knows the answer to that. will those people flying those bombers, if they get the order from, if the dual key system goes into action and both keys are used and all the codes are implemented, will those young guys flying those bombers let those bombs go? will those at the missile silos decide to engage and fire? we don't know, but you can see that it's more than one man making the decision here in a system of strategic nuclear weapons. as far as the tactical, the so-called low yield or battlefield nuclear weapons, we're not sure the system that they have in russia these days for their use of such tactical nuclear weapons. it could well be that putin and just himself, he alone can fire them or order them be fired. what you know, lex, there's no tactical nuclear weapon fired at ukraine that's not also fired simultaneously at russia. if the kremlin is 600 miles from ukraine and if the wind changes direction or the wind happens to be blowing east, northeast, the fallout hits your kremlin, not just ukraine. moreover, you have all those border regions which are staging regions for the russian offensive and they're a lot closer than 600 miles. they're actually right there. so you fire that weapon on ukrainian territory and you can get the fallout, just the chernobyl fallout spread to sweden, which is how we got the kremlin to finally, first they denied this. they said, , we don't know why there's a big nuclear cloud over sweden. we don't know where that came from, but eventually they admitted it. so russia can actually use a nuclear weapon, tactical battlefield one in ukraine, without also firing it at itself. and in addition, it's that same dynamic i alluded to earlier, which is to say you bomb a hospital, you bomb a school, there's more heavy weapons going to ukraine from the west. you can't get away with any of the, there's always going to be a response that's either proportional or greater than proportional. you could well have europe signing on to nato direct engagement, both washington and brussels, direct engagement of the russian army on the territory of ukraine. you think that's possible to do that without dramatic escalation from the russian side? yes, i do think it's possible, but it's very worrisome, just you're saying. but if putin were to escalate that, he's firing that weapon at himself, and he's potentially provoking a direct clash with nato's military, not just with the ukrainian military. if you're sitting in the kremlin looking at those chart slacks of nato capabilities, and you can't conquer ukraine, which didn't really have heavy weapons before february 2022 at scale, and you're thinking, okay, now i'm going to take out nato, that would be a bold step on the part of a russian leader. and let's also remember, lex, that there's another variable here. you're a despot as long as everyone implements your orders. and so if people start to say quietly, not necessarily publicly, i may not implement that order, because that's maybe a criminal order, or my grandma is ukrainian, or my wife is ukrainian, or i don't want to go to the hog. i don't want to spend the rest of my life in the hog, or whatever it might be. at any point along the chain of command, from the general staff all the way down to the platoon, you're a despot provided they implement your orders. but who's to say that somewhere along the chain of command, people start to say, you know, i'm going to ignore that order, or i'm going to sabotage that order, or i'm going to flee the battlefield, or i'm going to injure myself so that i don't have to fight, or i'm going to join the ukrainian side. and so it could be that what's left of the russian army in the field begins to disintegrate. even if the ukrainians are not able to mount that counteroffensive at scale, that combined arms operation, the russian military in the field, which has taken horrendous casualties as far as we understand, something a third of the original force, so you're talking about 50 to 60,000, that includes both dead and wounded to the point of being unable to return to the battlefield. those are big numbers, those were a lot of families, a lot of families affected. their sons, or their husbands, or their fathers are either missing in action, or the regime won't tell them that they're dead, as you know from the sinking of that flagship, moskva, right, by the ukrainians. and so a disintegration of the russian military, because there are orders that they either can't implement or don't want to implement, is also not excluded. and so you have these two big variables, the ukrainian army in the field and its ability to move from defense to offense at scale, and we're going to test that soon, and then the russian ability in the field to hold together in a war of conquest and aggression, where their conscripts, or their fed dog food, or they don't have any weapons anymore because there's no resupply, and so the disintegration of the army can't be excluded, and then of course all bets are off on the putin regime. more long-term, there are these technology export controls. we were talking about how the military-industrial complex in russia is dependent on foreign component parts and software. and so if you have export controls, and you have firms voluntarily, even when they don't follow their export controls, leaving russian business, refusing to do business with russia, and we see this not just in the civilian sector with mcdonald's or many other companies, we see this in the key areas the oil industry with the executives fleeing, that is the western executives fleeing, giving up their positions. so russia's ability to resupply its tanks, resupply its missiles, resupply its uniforms, resupply its food to its soldiers in the field and in their boots. we see a lot of stuff under tremendous stress, and in the long-term there's no obvious way they can rebuild the military-industrial complex to produce those weapons because they're reliant on foreign parts that they can't get anymore, and there are no domestic substitutes on the immediate horizon. that's at the earliest a two-year proposition to have domestic substitutes. and for some things microelectronics, they've never had domestic substitutes going back to the soviet times, as you know well. and so there's that pressure on russia from the technology export controls, which if you're in the security ministry or the defense ministry, if you're in that side of the regime, you're feeling that pain as we speak, and you're wondering about the strategy. let me ask you about, again, the echoes of history, and it frustrates me in part when people draw these parallels, but maybe there is some deep insight about those parallels. so there's a song that goes 22.06.2014 kiev was bombed, we were told that war had begun. so in operation barbarossa, the bombing of kiev by hitler, there is sort of an eerie parallel, and you have to be extremely careful drawing such parallels and such connections to this unexplainable war that is world war ii. but is there elements of this that do echo in the actions of vladimir putin? and more specifically, do you think that vladimir putin is a war criminal? can that label be assigned to the actions of this man? the war criminal is a legal determination, and it requires evidence and due process and the ability to defend oneself. we don't just decide in the twittersphere or on a podcast that somebody is a war criminal. they can be a suspected war criminal, and we can gather evidence to try to prosecute that case. and then the issue for us lexes, which court does it go to? what's the appropriate place? does it happen in ukraine because they're the victims? does it happen in the hague because there's an international criminal court there? does it happen inside russia because there's regime change at some point? and some of these people become, let's say, they get arrested by their own people inside russia. so those are all important questions that have to be pursued with resources and with determination and by skilled people who are excellent at gathering that evidence. and that process is underway. and ukraine has a trial underway now of one alleged war criminal who's pleaded guilty. and we'll see what the outcome of that trial inside ukraine is of a lower level official, not obviously vladimir putin, but the commander of a tank group. so, yes, the names are eerily familiar. izum, kharkiv, kiev, right? those are the names we know from the nazi invasion and the nazi occupation of ukraine. and it's very deeply troubling to think that this could happen again. and there's a bizarre sense that the russians claiming, as putin says, to denazify ukraine have invaded the same places that the nazis invaded back in 1941. as somebody who's working on volume three of your work on stalin going through this period, is it eerie to you? yes, it is, lex. i've written the chapters of volume three. i've drafted the chapters on the war. and as i said, the place names are very evocative, unfortunately. but, you know, the nazis failed ultimately. they captured ukraine for a time, but they were evicted from ukraine. and there was massive partisan or guerrilla warfare resistance behind nazi lines the whole time that they were allegedly in control of ukraine. if you look at the maps on cable tv, they show you the sign of russia. they show you the coloring, russian control. and they draw a line and then it's colored in. but the word control is misplaced. they don't actually control it. it's russian claimed or extent of farthest russian troop advancement. because behind the russian lines in ukraine, crimea accepted, you have insurgencies. you have armed insurgency. in melitopol, for example, which is a place that you know in southeastern ukraine, there is a guerrilla war now underway to hurt the russians who are in occupation of that city and region. and we're going to see that continue, even if the war becomes a stalemate, even if it's stalemates more or less at the lines we're at now, which would mean that anticipated ukrainian counteroffensive at scale proves unsuccessful. the russian army doesn't disintegrate. and you end up with a stalemate where there could be a ceasefire or not a ceasefire, but neither side is attempting an offensive for the time being. there will be resistance behind those russian lines. and it will be fierce resistance, the kind of resistance we saw to the nazi occupation. ultimately, it took the red army reinvading the territory of ukraine and succeeding at combined arms operations at scale, a massive counteroffensive much larger than anything we're talking about today. ultimately, it required that to evict the nazis from ukraine. but in the meantime, they did not have an easy occupation regime there. ukrainian partisans, soviet partisans killed nazi officials, wehrmacht soldiers, wehrmacht officers, blew up the infrastructure they were using, made them pay a price for their occupation. we could well see, if unfortunately this ends in a stalemate for the time being, we could well see that type of insurgency gain momentum behind russian lines and try to evict the russians that way and then remount the counteroffensive at scale later on in the future if the first one doesn't succeed. so that would be further echoes of the world war ii experience. the scale, once again, is much smaller. the size of the armies here, they're not in the many hundreds, 800,000, 700,000, a million two, a million four. that's not what we're talking about today. but the weapons, the cruise missiles, right, artillery fire. you know, artillery fire used to be very inaccurate and it was saturation. you would just fire towards the enemy lines and if you hit something, you hit something, and if you didn't, you just kept firing. now you have drones, lex. and so artillery fire is now sniper fire because you can coordinate the direction of the artillery fire with the drones. the drones can take a picture and show you where the enemy is precisely located and you can align that artillery to hit them instead of just indiscriminately bombing an area, a territory. and the nato supplied artillery goes really far. and you can fire into russian positions and yourself not be exposed to russian fire because your artillery fires farther than theirs. so that's coming and we're going to see that in action. and so the scale is not the same, but the weapons, the precision of some of the weapons and some of the nato. we're not sending all of our stuff, but as i said, the dynamic is russia commits atrocities, russia bombs schools, russia bombs hospitals, russia kills civilians, and more and heavier and more lethal western weapons go to ukraine. their willingness to risk their lives is really so impressive and the reason that we, it's our duty. we're obliged to supply those weapons. and so the russians don't have that resupply and the ukrainians do. and so the russians are now digging in, lex. they're digging in deeply in the areas that they've penetrated and they're trying to build unassailable positions for when the ukrainians transition from mostly defense to full scale offense. and we'll see if that now, i mean, they're digging everywhere, you know, as they say, kapayut, kapayut, right? they're digging everywhere behind. the russian is beautiful. digging in, i wish, lex, yours. but so there are these things that we can't predict, but there are these things we're watching and watching closely. and on top of that, something that's not in world war ii or for the most part is cyber attacks and cyber warfare, is much less perhaps convertible into human words because it happens so quickly, it's such large scales, so difficult to trace and all those kinds of things. it's not bullets, it's electrical signals and that. yeah, but those ukrainian people, they're you, lex. they're young and they're technically really proficient. yeah. and they've been amazing. you know, they spent those teenage years in the basement playing video games. turns out it's useful after all. it turns out it's more than useful. you can save your country that way. and so they're not alone. they're getting support and that support is important. but really, predominantly, it's ukrainians on the cyber battlefield and their skills have been very impressive and they've been preparing for this for a number of years. and they have a whole army of young people on the cyber side. it's their civilian population. these are not people conscripted into the military or volunteering wearing the uniform. and so even in cyber warfare, the ukrainians have been extremely impressive. and so let's remember that all of these aspects of warfare, whether it's how far your cruise missiles go and how accurate they are, what size your cyber capabilities are, it's really ultimately about the people. it's about the human capital. it's about their willingness, their skill level, but also their willingness to fight and to put their lives on the line. and there's no substitute for that. and so what's called morale or courage or bravery or valor, that's really the ultimately decisive provided you have enough sufficient arms to conduct the fight. and if you don't, you use a molotov cocktail. grandma calls in the coordinates of the russian tank on her iphone and you have a molotov cocktail that the people who used to work in the cafeteria are now stuffing flammable liquid into bottles. and you carry one right up to the tank and you smash it against the tank or you drop it in one of the hatches in the tank. there's no substitute for that kind of stuff, that level of resolve, willingness to die for your country. that's a really big lesson that we need to absorb in our own country. we've been going to war more frequently than we should. and you said, without the justification all the time. and then henry kissinger said, without understanding how this was going to end. it's easy to start a war. it's very difficult to win a war, prevail in a war, or end a war on terms that meet your original expectations. we've been fighting wars, but we haven't been fighting wars as societies. we've been fighting wars as a small sliver of our population. something 1 of our population is involved with the military because we have an all-volunteer force. and that means that it's easier for our politicians to go to war because they don't face conscription. they don't have the draft, which affects every family in the country. and because the number of people in the volunteer force is such a narrow stratum of the population. and so they've been getting away with this because the professional army is much better than the conscript army. and an all-volunteer force is much preferable from a military point of view. but from a societal point of view, it enables you to go to war too easily as a politician. and it doesn't engage the society the same way that the ukrainian society is completely engaged from those young hackers all the way up to those grandmothers. let me ask you, you're a scholar of history, a scholar of geopolitics, and you're also a human being. that's kind of you, lex. i'll take that. what's the value, what's the hope, what's the power of conversation here? if you could sit down with vladimir putin and have a conversation versus bullets, human exchange words, is there hope for those? and if so, what would you talk about? what would you ask him? well, henry kissinger, you alluded to his op-ed. he's had many private meetings with president putin over a long time. and president biden, the previous presidents, secretaries of state, officials below secretary of state, the head of the cia, evidently met with president putin in the fall when he was massing the troops on the border before he invaded. and we sent the head of the cia and putin received him, somebody he evidently respects or was at least willing to meet, unlike other members of the administration. so a lot of people are talking to him in some form or another for the 22 years he's been in power. and i'm not sure it's had what i would call their desired effect. well, the nature of the conversation is interesting too, and also the timing, which is post-february 22nd, is a different time. and also another aspect, which oliver stone mentioned interestingly, that there is something about covid and the pandemic that creates isolation, the distancing. it's such a silly little nuanced thing, but maybe it actually has a profound impact on the human being, the human mind of vladimir putin, that there is something about an in-person meeting, and not across a table that's far too large, but sort of the intimacy of a one human to human in-person conversation, that there's something distinctly powerful about that reminder that as putin says in the narrative and the propaganda, that we're all one people. there is truth to that, that this entirety of humanity is one people. and you're kind of reminded by that when you're sitting together. people who have sat across the table from him, whether at 30 yards or at three, have remarked upon this feeling of isolation that has affected him, the pandemic. i think there must be something to that, if several people who've been in the room with him are remarking on it. everybody that i know and i've been able to talk to who's had a meeting with him in the past 10 years, including henry kissinger, the former secretary of state, has said that putin spends a lot of time enumerating his grievances. he goes through a monologue of his grievances, and then the west did this, and then the west lied to us about that, and then the west cheated us on this. and so it's not the conversation that you're encouraging of common humanity. it's that roiling resentment volcano that's just exploding and exploding. it's the resentment. and by the time he gets through the monologue of the grievances, the time of the meeting is expired or over time. that's a brilliant statement, but that's where the skill of conversation comes in. like when you're facing a bull with a red cloth, you have to learn how to avoid the long list of grievances and get to the humanity. that's a really important skill. it's a skill. for sure it's a skill, and it's the highest level skill of a diplomat to be able to reach some type of common understanding when interests and worldviews clash so much. but here's your challenge, lex. your challenge is russia wants to impose a closed sphere of influence on its neighbors. it wants to dictate what its neighbors can and can't do. it wants to exert influence not by the power of its example, not by the freedom of its people, not by the dynamism of its diversified economy, but it wants to exert influence just because it deserves that, just because it's a great power, just because and on and on and on. it's a civilization unto itself. and it wants that, and we can't give that. the reason that russia was not integrated into the west was not for lack of trying. it was because russia ultimately spurned the integration because it was about what terms the integration would come on. would you come into the west and observe western rules and be another country, meaning just another country? there's poland and there's austria and there's little tiny monaco and there's russia. and you're just one of those countries. and russia's answer to that was no, we're not just one of those countries. we need special rules. we need special conditions. we'll integrate, but only as a special country, meaning at the un where all countries are sovereign, all countries are members, but russia has a veto on what countries can and can't do. those were the terms on which they were willing to integrate. and those were the terms that no leader of a western country or the united states or the g7 or fill in the blank can grant to russia. it's very well known that vladimir putin was one of the first, maybe the first person, first leader, foreign leader, to call president bush after the 9-11 tragedy. they didn't connect right away. president bush was not in washington, but eventually they did speak. he condemned the terrorist attack. he offered russian support, which he delivered on. the use of some russian logistics for our afghanistan operations. and a lot of people point to that and they say, there it is. russia wanted to cooperate and did cooperate and we spurned them or we failed to appreciate russia's cooperation. and so therefore russia was cheated or russia was lied to or russia's grievances are legitimate. but here's the problem with that argument, lex. in exchange for that support, vladimir putin asked in return from president bush for a free hand in the former soviet space that closed hierarchical sphere of influence where russia would exert influence coercively over countries that were sovereign. and no american president could grant that and president bush was right. he said no. and so the attempted cooperation blew up. but who's at fault there? should there be a non-voluntary sphere of influence? should that be granted? or should you face up to attempts to do that? let's take a little detour here into china for a second. china had this brilliant grand strategy which was, sure, america is hostile because america is hegemonic. america wants to control the world. america will never let china rise. america will do everything it can to hold china down. so we're going to have hostility from america. we don't want to decouple because we need that high-end technology transfer. either we buy it or we steal it because america and the rest of the west has all the technology that we need. we have some of it domestically, more than before by a lot, but we're still dependent so we can't decouple. so we'll have the hostility, but there'll be a line we don't cross just so that we don't lose the technology transfer. till made in china 2035 is accomplished and we're self-sufficient domestically in ai and every other area that's critical, but hostility from america. but we have an ace in the hole. our ace in the hole is europe. europe hates conflict. they're all about trade. it doesn't matter how evil you are. they love to trade because vandel door handle, change through trade. they have this illusion that you're going to become a better country if they trade with you and you won't have conflict, war, and hostilities if you trade. and so we have this european ace in the hole. we're hostile with the americans. we're still buying or stealing their technology. and better than that even, the europeans are not hostile to us at all. they love to trade with us and they want to trade more and they're our biggest trading partner already. and lo and behold, xi jinping sides with vladimir putin in the aggression in ukraine. he doesn't side with him providing military equipment. he doesn't provide technology transfer, but he provides public support and massive pro-russian propaganda to the whole chinese population. and the europeans say, wait a minute, this is an invasion of a sovereign country in europe. what do you mean? you're not condemning vladimir putin's invasion. and so that wedge that the chinese had, that was the basis of their grand strategy, that wedge between the us and europe when it came to china policy, that wedge is gone now. xi jinping destroyed it. and the europeans and the americans are coming close together on ukraine and russia policy for sure, but also more and more on china policy. and so that was a pretty big sacrifice for the chinese leader to make. and what did he get in return? he gets hydrocarbons from russia at reduced prices. and the chinese get hydrocarbons from a lot of countries. they have a completely diverse supply chain for their energy. so what do you think xi jinping is thinking now? was it a mistake? i'd to know, lex. i'd you to be able to sit down with him across from this table here on your podcast and pose that same question to him because we have no idea. there's a language barrier that's fascinating. by the way, you as a scholar of stalin, do you think we'll ever break through the language barrier to china? not ever, i apologize, in the next few years because there is a gigantic cultural and language barrier between the west and the chinese. china's a great civilization. china predates the united states by millennia. china's accomplishments are breathtaking. but china's also led by, let's be honest, a communist party monopoly which engages in a lot of criminal behavior. lex, tibet is ukraine. xinjiang is ukraine. hong kong is ukraine, let alone support for putin. this is before we've even discussed taiwan. and so now the europeans are coming to see this and the americans are coming to understand this that maybe trading with a regime that, morally, politically, criminally, tibet, xinjiang, hong kong, how is that different from what putin is doing in ukraine? i'd be hard pressed to differentiate that ultimately, even though the analogies are not exact. and so the chinese, it's that guy leonov, the author of l'échalette, the great memoir of the late soviet period, the end of the soviet union, that they spend all this time and all these resources blackening our image, but we supply them with endless material to blacken our image. that's where xi jinping's regime is right now, lex. and so they have a big dilemma on their side. it's a western world and they've united the western world and reawoken the reston world to the fact that china is a threat to the values, the institutions and values of the west. and that trade is not transforming china quite the opposite. we'll see if this endures. maybe it doesn't endure. maybe it's a fleeting moment. maybe this is not an inflection point. maybe the war in ukraine ends more quickly than we think. and maybe, you said, the chinese and the indians and the rest of them, the leaders there, they get their wish that it ends and the world moves on and forgets or says, let's try again to resume our mutual understanding, our mutually beneficial trade and everything else. maybe it's a passing phase. we can't exclude that. i'm very poor at predicting the future. but the moment is not a good one for the chinese regime, let alone the fact that he's trying to impose an unprecedented in the modern era third term for himself as president in the fall at the next party congress, becoming president for life, de facto, as a mao- figure. and he's now got to do that in this environment where he has damaged chinese grand strategy and damaged the reputation of china and its relationships across the world, maybe not permanently, but significantly, in addition to the problems they have at home, demography, as you know, a middle income trap. and then the regulatory insanity of chinese communist rule that we've seen with the tech companies that you know well where they've destroyed all of that value, with the blow up of their property sector because it was a massive bubble and that's still playing out. and this time it's the same, meaning this time it's not different. when it comes to a property blowout, it has enormous effects on middle class balance sheets and their ability to remain consumers and drive the economy, which is the model that they have to share. so he's got a litany of challenges, independent even, of the fact that he sided with his pal vladimir putin and their bromance is costing china very, very significantly. if you close your eyes, and 100 years ago, 1922, and you think about the future, i wonder if you can hear the drums of war predicting the 30s, predicting the great depression and the resentment that builds, the economic resentment, the cultural resentment, the political resentment that builds and leads to world war ii. at least to me, when i close my eyes, i can hear the drums of war that are still ahead of us. and it's possible that 2022 will materialize in a similar way as did 1922. i have my eyes closed, lex. do you hear anything? and i sure hope that that's not what happens. but i'm looking at 1922. it's an epoch i know well, and i don't see the future that unfolds. i would not have predicted it had i been alive then. i see the war behind us. i see prosperity on the horizon. yes, inflation in germany and some many other difficult issues, but there are more democracies now than there were before the war and the old empires are gone. and there's a cultural efflorescence and there's modernism in the arts and there's women entering the public sphere. and there's all this fantastic new technology automobiles. and i'm looking at the future from 1922, and i'm not seeing the great depression and i'm not seeing world war ii and i'm not seeing the holocaust because i don't predict the future and nobody in 1922 could see that future, although i guess there were some clairvoyants who predicted it. but you're not one of them. i'm not one of them. but this is what i know, lex, from studying history. what i know is stuff happens. in other words, lex, we're watching ukraine war right now and all of our attention is focused on that. and it's the economists say in their textbooks when their powerful models are employed. and there's this line that says, all other factors held constant, and then the model works. and you get this really great result, this very powerful predictor and analysis of the model. and the whole game is all other factors held constant. so the russia-ukraine war that we've been discussing, and this could happen and that could happen, but you know what stuff could happen, lex? for example, the israeli government could decide this summer that it's going to bomb iran because no israeli government will tolerate iran acquiring a nuclear weapon. and since president trump exited, unilaterally exited from the multi-power nuclear agreement, iran is now much closer to the bomb than they were when the united states was still in that agreement. and you tell me the israeli government that says, sure, it's fine, it's okay, iran could get the bomb. and so maybe that happens. and maybe that happens as early as this summer as iran gets closer and closer and closer. maybe that guy in north korea decides it's his time, just his grandfather, right, in 1950 decided, you know, it's time we're going to, quote, reunify, unquote, the korean peninsula. maybe, i don't know, lex, fill in the blank, something's going to happen. it's not going to be what i predict. it's not going to be what i'm watching. it's going to be obvious only after it happens, not before. and then it's going to upend the table. and all of a sudden... everything changes....we're going to be in a different environment, different circumstances. and is ukraine still as central at that point as it seems to be right now? i don't know the answer to that question. let me ask two rapid-fire questions. you're only allowed to have one minute, and it's about predicting the future. okay. question one. vladimir putin, when will he no longer be in office? and will he step down or be overthrown? what's your prediction and a brief explanation of that prediction? now, nobody can predict the future, but what's your sense now? some people are saying the pressure is building. he's going to be overthrown or stepped down at the end of this year. and some people say, surely he's going to outlast stalin's rule of 30-plus years. no evidence of a coup yet. none whatsoever. yet. he's pretty much at life expectancy for a russian male. those are bad numbers. he's 69, going to be 70. so he's lived the life of a russian male already, but he's got better doctors than the majority of the russian males in that, let's say, comparison set. so he could live a very long time with good doctors. so there could be a coup at some point, but there's none today in evidence. he could go because he's reached the life expectancy, or he could stay for a long time. the thing to watch about this is an organization that nobody pays attention to. the fso, the federalnaya sluzba ochrannaya, which is the praetorian guard, the self-standing bodyguard directorate, the only one, the only organization in russia that has any access to him. we've seen no disloyalty, no breaking of ranks, no defections, nothing in the public realm and in open sources about any divisions or problems in the fso, in the praetorian guard. so if you can't break that, change that, elicit defections there, you can't overturn him. authoritarian regimes, lex, they're terrible. they fail at everything. they can't feed their people. they have trouble achieving any goals. they only have to be good, however, at one thing. they only have to be good at the complete suppression of political alternatives. if you can suppress political alternatives, you can fail at everything else, but you can survive as an authoritarian regime. so you watch navalny. he's still alive. that's my question number two. that's my second rapid-fire question, is what happens to navalny? what are the possible conclusions of what you said quite possibly the second most influential, powerful figure in russia? is he going to die in jail? will he become the next president of russia? well, what are the possible... i wish i knew, lex. i've been surprised that he's still alive. i've been worried that he will be killed in prison in a staged fight. you know, some security officer, prison guard, puts on a prison outfit, takes a lead pipe, goes into the cell. they have a, quote, fight, and navalny is killed. i've been afraid of that, but he's still alive, even though he's serving a long sentence. so that leads me to guess that people inside the putin regime and maybe president putin himself understand that navalny is their ticket to lift sanctions. that navalny is even more popular outside of russia than he is inside of russia. you know, he's the leader in many ways of the political opposition in the country. even while still in prison, his organization's been destroyed. but he doesn't have majority support in the population by any stretch of the imagination. but he's a big figure in the west, including here in the us. and so navalny could be their ticket, their kind of get-out-of-jail card, meaning they release him from prison, he gets appointed, i don't know, prime minister even by the putin regime, if he were willing to accept such a position. and i have my doubts about that. and then that's how they lobby to remove the sanctions against them. so he's a card that president putin could play. and so maybe that's the reason he's still alive, or maybe there are other reasons that we don't know. and so some alternative to putin is more likely to arise inside his gang, putin's shayka as they say, right, inside his gang, where they tire of his mistakes, they tire of his self-defeating actions, and they say, patriotically for russia, we need to do something against, move against this guy because he's hurting our country and also because i could do better. i'm ambitious as well as patriotic. but once again, the problem there, alex, is putin is surrounded by this cocoon known as the fso. he meets on zoom predominantly with the rest of the government, including with the defense and security officials. they don't have frequent access to his person. and as you were alluding earlier to the pandemic, they have to quarantine for two weeks before every meeting with him. and moreover, you know, alex, they don't know where he is. you see, when they're on zoom with him and the room, it's the valdai. his office in the valdai region looks the same as his office in sochi or his office outside of moscow and novgorod. they're made up to look very similar on zoom. and sure, some signs they're looking, where is it? but maybe they don't know. and so you're going to move on him and you're going to jump him in his kremlin, his dacha outside moscow. and it turns out he's in sochi or vice versa. and it turns out the fso is loyal to him and won't let you anyway. so, lex, we don't know, but we watch this fso really closely. and we think that the elites, if not putin, but maybe putin too understand navalny as a really big potential political card that they could play. and one last question, the biggest question. you studied some of the darkest aspects of human history, human nature. let me ask the why question. what are we doing here? what's the meaning of our existence, our life here on earth? what are we humans trying to get at here? i can't answer that question either. but i can say that having a purposeful life is actually not that hard. you can't, you're not gandhi. you're not president roosevelt. you're not going to transform a country or a civilization or become immortal because of your courage and your insight and your genius at critical moments. but you live in an environment, you're in a school, you're in a workplace. you're somewhere where you can affect other people in a positive way. it can be not just about yourself, but it can be about them. and you can have a positive impact on other people's lives through the work that you do, whether that's your employment or your charity or your spare time or your work time. it can be by modeling proper behavior, right? admitting your mistakes, hard to do but necessary. remembering that you don't know everything. you can't predict the future, but you don't even know everything in your areas of expertise. painfully reminded of that humility at times, but remind yourself too. so you can lead a life that can show others what good values are. and you can lead a life that dedicates yourself not only to your own material well-being, but to the well-being and to the development of others around you. and it can be on a humble scale. it can be in a small classroom or a small workplace, a small work team. but it can be done. and you can be reminded that having a positive impact even on one other person gives far greater meaning to your own life and is profoundly satisfying, much more satisfying than the attention you might get, let's say, on social media or awards you might receive. there's nothing wrong with pursuing those. people pursue them. it's a free society. but leading a purposeful life intentionally is possible. even just one person, i love the expression, save one life, save the world. just focusing on the local, on the tiny little difference you can make in the world can somehow ripple. every day. if you think about that every single day, you're a better person. we're a better society. and maybe you get to add a bit of love to the world after all. stephen, this is a huge honor for many reasons, one of which is i can just tell how much care you put into this conversation and how much, i use the word love a lot, but i just feel the love that, just even the respect you give me, which i can't tell you how energized that is, how much that gives me strength for my own silly little pursuits. thank you so much for doing that. thank you for not just talking today, but giving me so much respect just with everything you're doing. i really appreciate that. it makes me feel special. so thank you so much for sitting down and talking today. mutual, lex, thank you as well and thank you for the respect that you've shown me. these are really difficult issues that don't have simple answers. but that doesn't mean we give up. we have to keep thinking and learning and trying and finding solutions in everything we do, including on these big global tragedies that we live through. and it's heartbreaking what's going on. it just breaks my heart every day. a person who studies this has been studying this for decades and it keeps happening. and you think again, and yes, it is again, but we still have to keep trying and we have to be inspired by those people who are more courageous than we are and sacrifice more than we sacrifice. for me, the russian invasion of ukraine, the war in ukraine, is experienced in my study at home and in my office at princeton or my coming office at stanford when i move full-time to stanford in september. it's experienced far away in safety and in comfort. and we have to remember that too when we talk about these things, when we answer your questions, right? that as we speak and as we comment and think we're experts on these things from the comfort of our existence, that there are people in those tragedies right now. with no power, with no food, with full uncertainty about the future of the health of their children. that's it. and i've also seen because i have family in both places, homes that were home for... buildings that were homes for generations now in rubble. so... yes, lex, it hurts. and it's syria where 350,000 at least by un estimates died and russia participated in that. and it's yemen. and it's so many other places that don't have the same degree of attention that a european country ukraine has. but yeah, we have to remember also that in addition to ukraine, and then there's things right home here in new york city where children are without food. it's just inexcusable in a country this rich. so we shouldn't forget in our study of leaders and our study of geopolitics that ultimately it's about the humanity, it's about the human beings and... okay, lex....human suffering. thank you so much, stephen. thank you. this is an amazing conversation. talk to you again soon. my pleasure. thanks for listening to this conversation with stephen cotkin. to support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. and now let me leave you with some words from mahatma gandhi. when i despair, i remember that all

      "{'prompt': \"webvtt kind captions language en multiply (3x2) by (5x-7). so we are multiplying two binomials. i am actually going to show you two really equivalent ways of doing this. one that you might hear in a classroom and it is kind of a more mechanical memorizing way of doing it which might be faster but you really don't know what you are doing and then there is the one where you are essentially just applying something what you already know and kind of a logical way. so i will first do the memorizing way that you might be exposed to and they'll use something called foil. so let me write this down here. so you can immediately see that whenever someone gives you a new mnemonic to memorize, that you are doing something pretty mechanical. so foil literally stands for first outside, let me write it this way.....f o i l where the f in foil stands for first, the o in foil stand for outside, the i stands for inside and then the l stands for last. the reason why i don't these things is that when you are 35 years old, you are not going to remember what foil stood for and then you are not going to remember how to multiply this binomial. but lets just apply foil. so first says just multiply the first terms in each of these binomials. so just multiply the 3x times the 5x. so (3x. 5x). the outside part tells us to multiply the outside terms. so in this case, you have 3x on the outside and you have -7 on the outside. so that is 3x(-7). the inside, well the inside terms here are 2 and 5x. so, (2.5x) and then finally you have the last terms. you have the 2 and the -7. so the last terms are 2 times -7. 2(-7). so what you are essentially doing is just making sure that you are multipying each term by every other term here. what we are essentially doing is multiplying, doing the distributive property twice. we are multiplying the 3x times (5x-7). so 3x times (5x-7) is (3x . 5x) plus (3x - 7). and we are multiplying the 2 times (5x-7) to give us these terms. but anyway, lets just multiply these out just to get our answer. 3x times 5x is same thing as (3 times 5) ( x times x) which is the same thing as 15x square. you can just do this x to the first time to x to the first. you multiply the x to get x squared. 3 times 5 is 15. this term right here 3 times -7 is -21 and then you have your x right over here. and then you have this term which is 2 times 5 which is 10 times x. so 10x. and then finally you have this term here in blue. 2 times -7 is -14. and we aren't done yet, we can simplify this a little bit. we have two terms here. we have this...let me find a new color. we have 2 terms with a x to the first power or just an x term right over here. so we have -21 of something and you add 10 or in another way, you have 10 of something and you subtract 21 of them, you are going to have -11 of that something. we put the other terms here, you have 15... 15x squared and then you have your -14 and we are done. now i said i would show you another way to do it. i want to show you why the distributive property can get us here without having to memorize foil. so the distributive property tells us that if we 're... look if we are multipying something times an expression, you just have to multiply times every term in the expression. so we can distribute, we can distribute the 5x onto the 3..., or actually we could...well, let me view it this way... we could distribute the 5x-7, this whole thing onto the 3x2. let me just change the order since we are used to distributing something from the left. so this is the same thing as (5x-7)(3x2). i just swapped the two expressions. and we can distribute this whole thing times each of these terms. now what happens if i take (5x-7) times 3x? well, thats just going to be 3x times (5x-7). so i have just distributed the 5x-7 times 3x and to that i am going to add 2 times 5x-7. i have just distributed the 5x-7 onto the 2. now, you can do the distributive property again. we can distribute the 3x onto the 5x. we can distribute the 3x onto the 5x. and we can distribute the 3x onto the -7. we can distribute the 2 onto the 5x, over here and we can distribute the 2 on that -7. now if we do it this what do we get ? 3x times 5x, that's this right over here. if we do 3x times -7, that's this term right over here. if you do 2 times 5x, that's this term right over here. if you do 2 times -7, that is this term right over here. so we got the exact same result that we got with foil. now, foil can be faster if you just wanted to do it and kind of skip to this step. i think its important that you know that this is how it actually works. just in case you do forget this when you are 35 or 45 years old and you are faced with multiplying binomial, you just have to remember the distributive property.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

what song is equivalent in english. maybe uptown girl by billie joe is similar in spirit, but very different in style. i just watched the video on youtube for uptown girl and it's basically billie joe dressed up as a mechanic, but dancing in a way that i'm pretty sure no mechanic has ever danced, turning the old cringe factor up to 11. anyway, i always felt i didn't really fit in with the fancy

your view is the greatest warrior in history, ancient or modern? that's a tough question, and again, i'm no historian by any measure, so i'll probably do the worst. it's , what are your best bands ever? i'm metallica, and you know, so i'll pick the- metallica just came out with a new album, by the way, for the entire orchestra. that's kind of cool. yeah. metallica will always be one of the greatest. yeah, that's awesome. they were a bad example. they were a well-known yet awesome band. let me say, it's nickelback or something that. but i feel that feels cheap because everyone makes fun of nickelback. yeah. i don't know, i guess it depends on how you want to define warrior. something that i think about when it comes to trying to evaluate various people or situations or things that i've read about or heard about are the circumstances that they were involved in, because i think a lot of times it's easy to look at the outcomes. and obviously outcome, we live in an outcome-driven world and outcomes do matter, but at the same time, you look at, let's say what cuba has been able to pull off from a combat sports perspective, it's staggering. like the amount of successful olympic level competitors they have in wrestling, boxing, judo. i mean, they're a tiny little island with no money and no people. that's shocking. when you think about the olympics in the united states doing well, of course we should do well. i mean, russia should do well, china should do well. india should do better than they do, honestly. obviously it means they're not into it as much or at least certain sports because they have the resources people-wise. so talent's not gonna be an issue. so there's something to where the starting point is. like that's the argument with why people say maradona, i don't know if you're into soccer. oh yeah, big soccer. okay. they say maradona is better than messi because he basically carried the team and won the world cup with a team that wouldn't otherwise win the world cup. and then messi was only successful in barcelona because he has superstars. he's playing with other superstars. right. yeah, that's fair to say. i mean, united there's a lot of factors that go into, let's say winning a soccer game and obviously barcelona, particularly for various points in time had a ridiculous all-star squad of world-class players. but, and i'll say for instance, maybe they didn't have the creative players in argentina. they needed to get the ball up to messi. you know, they didn't have the nes, and you know, the, you know, the, again, the backing there in the midfield. but, because obviously argentina's always had ridiculous attacking players, even alongside messi, but they're the three killers up front and then little less behind. so it's interesting you say that, depends how you define warrior, because you can probably take some of the civil rights leaders. you can go into that direction, leaders in general. but if we just look at the greatest martial artists in history, in that direction, do you have somebody in mind? i would say at least three, three that pop into my head and would be hannibal, alexander the great, and then maybe miyamoto musashi. you know, the two commanders and then one, you know, guy. but, so it's interesting. and then again, you mentioned warriors being able to make a lot out of a little, you know, musashi's famous for winning duels, you know, that were oftentimes one, there were one-on-one. you know, the alexander and hannibal were, you know, military commanders and one of them faced rome. and that was an interesting thing. oftentimes, you know, coming up with novel tactics, different strategies, sometimes under resourced, having to do novel and crazy things. there's skin in the game. that's an interesting thing too. i think a lot of times, you know, if you're playing a video game, i don't think you can be a warrior because there's no skin in the game. you get hurt, you lose, and that's a bummer. it stings a little bit, maybe it makes you feel slightly disappointed. but, you know, musashi loses, he loses. hannibal loses, he loses. alexander loses, he loses. and they lose, i guess the people around them lose. so that's almost you could use, even from a combat sports perspective, a muhammad ali. i mean, you consider also their quality of opposition. musashi was fighting high quality opposition. obviously hannibal and alexander, particularly hannibal were fighting unbelievable opposition. muhammad ali fought phenomenal opposition, but he had skin in the game, both in the ring and out. and that actually meshes with, as you mentioned, a civil rights type of situation where you are under-resourced, you're pushing the stone uphill. and that was a neat thing i think about muhammad ali was how much personal conviction the man had to have in order to pull off what he was able to pull off, both in and outside of the ring. and that reminds me of, again, some of the other great leaders or great fighters throughout history. so what do you make of the kind of very difficult idea that some of these conquerors alexander the great and somebody that, if you listen to hardcore history, dan carlin, who apparently elon musk is also a big fan of is the genghis khan episode. a large percent of the world is, can call genghis khan an ancestor. so the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors is that there's a lot of murder and rape and pillage and stealing of resources and all that kind of stuff. and yet they're often remembered as quite honorable. i mean, in the case of genghis khan, there's a lot of people who argue, if you look at the, historically, the way it's described, in full context, is he was ultimately a, given the time he was a liberator, he was a progressive, i should say. you know, in terms of the violence and the atrocities he committed, he, at least in the stories, has always provided the option of not to do that. it's only if you resist to, so you basically have the option, do you wanna join us or do you want to die and die horribly? so that's the progressive sort of, that's the bernie sanders of the era. nice. so what do you make of that? that there's so much of these great conquerors, there's so much murder that to us now would just seem insane. it's funny you mentioned it. i think that maybe it's a human nature thing that we want to, or maybe a misunderstanding thing that we want to cast all of our characters and ourselves, maybe is entirely good or is entirely negative when, i guess the phrase or the saying, one man's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist, is accurate. and a lot of times i think you can understand as long as you're able to look from various people's perspective. like if you look at the tv show, the wire, which was obviously, you know, widely, everybody loves the wire. i thought that there were everyone, i'm not saying anything that's not been said before, compelling characters from all angles, whether you the character, dislike the character, you were able to understand the motivations of people doing various things. even if they did wrongly, they did rightly. you know, we want to cast all of the demons throughout history as completely inhuman when i think that makes it difficult for us to understand them. and we want to look back at the people that we think of as great and entirely great. and i think that we're experiencing the problems with this, you know, even right now, socially and politically, as we're trying to look back and decide the people we thought were good are not good, or people we thought were bad are now good, rather than going, hey, there's good and bad to all things. and there are, as you mentioned, the genghis khan thing, you don't have to fight back. you do, i respect you for it, but then we're gonna have a conflict and then we'll see what happens. and if you lose, you're gonna be sorry that you did, because i have to make it that way if i want to continue utilizing this kind of mo, because i need to discourage the next guy from doing what you're doing right now. and ultimately though, i guess that's an interesting thing. imagine you put every single person on planet earth in a cage, crime drops, you know? also, there are certain positives to that. and it's just things are as they are, it's difficult, but that is ultimately more the law of the jungle. and i think that we're able to supersede some of that now in modern times, and i think we're fortunate. but as you mentioned, we look back and say, , this is horrible. say, no, that just is what it is. that's how life is at a base level. and again, if you're a lion and i'm a gazelle, i don't really it very much, but we don't call the lion the bad guy. we don't sanctify the gazelle or the other way around. so it's interesting when you pull back some of the controls that we put on our behavior in modern life, which i think are generally speaking positive, we get down to how things often are. and at the same time, modern life was built by people genghis khan. so then you get down to the ends justifying the means. it's a tough question. these aren't things with easy answers, or at least if they are, i certainly don't have the smarts to figure out the answers to them. but it's difficult, i would just say people in the world are complicated and layered. and depending upon which side of the line you're standing on at various times, you may or dislike someone, but i can't remember whose idea it was, this is killing me, but it's the veil of ignorance, i guess, the philosophical idea of the veil of ignorance where i go is sticking everyone in the cage, the right thing to do, when i say, or everyone but me. and i say, well, no, why? well, it would make my life easier if i just went over and took all of your stuff as long as you couldn't stop me. i mean, of course that's a great idea, that's what everyone does in every video game. but in skyrim, you steal stuff when people aren't around. but ultimately you go, well, this isn't the right thing to do because if i were on the other side of it, i would not appreciate it. it's inherently not a good thing to do. i'm only doing it because i think i'm gonna win. and that's a fine way to be, but you don't have the white hat on, i guess i would say. so i think without those philosophical underpinnings to rein us in, i guess morally speaking, it's very difficult to say what's right or wrong. and you'd say certain actions have a reaction, almost a physics sense. if you kill everyone in your way for as long as you're able to, your life will be easier. i mean, you're setting the table for someone doing the same to you when you're no longer the tough guy, but it is what it is. yeah, if you look at the instagram channel, nature is metal, it hurts my heart to watch, to remind me, a comfortable descendant of ape, how vicious nature is, just unapologetically. i mean, there's a process to it where the bad guy always wins. the violence is the solution to most problems or the flip side of that, running away from violence is the solution, depending on your skillset. and it's funny to think of us humans with our extra little piece of brain that we're somehow trying to figure out, you said, in a philosophical way, how to supersede that, how to move past the viciousness, the cruelty, just the cold exchange of nature. but perhaps it's not so, maybe that is nature, maybe that's the way of life, maybe we're trying too hard to, we're being too egotistical in thinking we're somehow separate from nature, we're somehow distant from that very thing. i couldn't agree with you more, in fact, i think actually orson scott card, who's the writer of a great book called ender's game, this was a statement that the main character, ender made in the book, his brother was brilliant, his brother was kind of sociopathic, brilliant kid that was ended up kicked out of the school that they were all into for battle commander. dealing with his brother taught him that ultimately strength, courage, the ability to do violence for all the good and the bad of that is one of the fundamental most important things to be able to do in life, because if you can't cause destruction, if you can't cause pain, you will be forever subject to those who can. and i think that you mentioned egotism, i think that that's a disease that could obviously strike any of us, but it's something that we're looking at now, i think we should be unbelievably thankful as people that live in the world that we do, that we can walk down the street without having to worry that i'm , well, don't worry, that six foot six, 270 pound person over there is just gonna leave me alone. and i have a rolex on, but whatever, i'll be fine, because that person is deciding to leave me alone because we've all agreed to live in this relatively, sane and or constrained society because it benefits all of us. and we're doing it because of a philosophical underpinning, not because nature dictates it be that way, because nature dictates it go in a very, very different direction and the only person, the only thing stopping that person from doing something to me is either me, that person or someone else that will stand in between us. and if i can't do it and there's no one there to stand in between us, then the only thing stopping that person is that person. and i have to hope that they're either disinterested or disinclined to do that sort of thing. and i think that, you know, it's keeping in mind that that is the fundamental nature of the world, whether we it or not is important. and i think the quest to fundamentally alter human nature is gonna be ultimately fruitless. and then also it's, it is a little bit egotistical. a lion does what a lion does, you know, we can try to box it in and we can try to, you know, guide this direction, that direction, but you know, nature is as it is and as it always will be unless we wanna start to constrain it significantly. but now i'm starting to get into individual rights, who put me in charge, who says that i should be the one to make the choice is constraining because many of the most awful things have happened throughout history. one group or one person has decided to constrain others. and we don't genghis khan doing that. well, i'll do that on a little level. are there gonna be benefits and beneficiaries? absolutely, but there'll be losers in that too. so i guess it's a dangerous game. it's almost putting on the one ring. we remember when frodo offered the one ring to gandalf and gandalf said, no, no, i would take it away. i would put it on, i would use it out of the desire to do good, but through me, it would wield a power so terrible you can't imagine. i think that's the big question for anyone that decides that's able to have reach and able to have power. i mean, obviously i can't speak to that, but imagine you did have national level, global level power, how would you use it? would you try to change the world? would you be glad that you did down the line? i don't know. yeah, i mean, that's the thing we're struggling now as a society, maybe it'd be nice to get your quick comment on that, which is the people who have traditionally been powerless are now seeking a fairer society, a more equal society and in attaining more power justly, there's also a realization at least from my perspective that power corrupts everyone, even if the flag you wave is that of justice, right? and so, not to overuse the term, but it'd be nice if you have thoughts about the whole idea of cancel culture and the internet and twitter and so on where there's a nuanced difficult discussions of race, of gender, of fairness, equality, justice, all of these kinds of things, there's a shouting down oftentimes of nuanced discussion of kind of trying to reason through these very difficult issues through our history, through what our future looks . do you have thoughts about the internet discourse that's going on now? is there something positive that we can pull out of this? it's an interesting thing to see, i guess, as you mentioned, that the internet is not just a tool for us to use, it's an interesting thing to see, i guess, as you mentioned, anytime you're wielding power, whomever you are, doing so carefully is important and it's very, very easy to look at the people that have power and that are using it poorly or have used it poorly and go, hey, you're the bad guy and then go, well, of course, if i had power, i'll use it properly and i may intend to use it properly and maybe i will, but at the same time, people are people are people. i think that a lot of the, i think if you believe that human beings are all one, which i do, no matter whether you're here or there, you got two arms, two legs, a heart, a brain, we all live a similar experience and obviously with variations on a theme, but you're no less a human being if you're a person i've never met from china than some person in virginia. we're all people and i guess ultimately, if i believe that human beings are corruptible and that power corrupts and that we're all fallible and we say and do things that either intentionally or unintentionally that we wish we'd not, i think that i have to allow for a space, i guess the word, it's almost a religious term, but i guess it would just say grace and that's something that i see disappearing from discourse in the public or maybe it wasn't there, i'm not sure, but it's interesting watching this occur on the internet because also now no longer are you and i just having a talk sitting on a bus stop, it's now in writing, everything's in writing, the old saying , don't put that in writing, don't put anything in writing, that's how you get in trouble and basically with the degree to which everything is recorded but recorded in tiny little bites, it's very, very easy for me to wave every last little foolish, ignorant, incorrect or correct thing that someone has ever said or done in their face to support whatever argument that i'm trying to make about them or a situation and i think that you mentioned cancel culture or as it seems to exist, obviously this is poisonous, on its face this is poisonous. it's the sort of thing that doesn't incentivize proper behavior, i mean you look at, let's say, one of the great monsters of history, adolf hitler, obviously who's done awful, awful things, but also for anyone that's even a minor student of history, did some positive things as well. we don't have to, i don't have to embroider this person's crimes, i don't have to act as if there was nothing good a monster has ever done and nothing bad that a great person throughout history has ever done, but imagine the ghost of adolf hitler were to pop up and go, my gosh guys, i'm so sorry, i know what i've done but i'd to apologize and start to make it right. well, i mean you'd hope that if he popped up over here, you'd go, well i don't really what you've done and i don't you, but at the same time, i'm glad to hear that you're attempting to make this right and push in a positive direction, even if you can't make it right, because otherwise, what am i doing? i'm disincentivizing change for the better. i'm looking to wield whatever power i have in a punitive fashion, which does not encourage people to do anything other than double down on the wrongs that they've made, knowing that at least they're gonna have some support from the people that support that. and i guess i want to, you would hopefully look at the use of the internet as a tool that can educate, and i guess i don't the word empower, but empower people to do various things, extend their reach, but educate and learn rather than to further solidify little tribal things that exist, which i think everyone in humanity and human history is vulnerable to. i mean, look at the course of human history, it's deeply tribal. and the tribes or the groups that have been on top at various points in time have done a lot of times bad things to the ones that have not. and you'd hope that we could learn lessons from the past and rather than committing the crimes that were committed against us, recommitting them when we slide into the top position, say, i could do this now, but i'll not. i understand the urge to seek vengeance is strong. anyone that says differently, i wouldn't trust. but at the same time, we have enough experience in history, enough experience in life, enough hopefully wisdom time in to go, this isn't the right answer. this is only gonna replay the things, the worst parts of our history, not the best. and i want to encourage positive behavior. and if i just, again, further lash out at people, although understandably, done understandably, i'm simply just gonna just perpetuate the cycle that's gone on to this point. so you hope that even though we're seeing a lot of turmoil societally at the moment and globally at the moment, that i guess our better angels can prevail at a certain point, but it's gonna take a great deal of leadership. and i think that we're sorely missing a martin luther king style character at the moment or a great leader. and i just, i'm hoping that one will show up. for sure. and by the way, a word i don't hear often, and i think it's a beautiful one, which is grace. that's a really interesting word. i'm gonna have to think about that. there is a religious component to it, but it's exactly right. you have to somehow walk the line between, you mentioned hitler, i've been reading the rise and fall of the third reich. i'm really thinking about the 1930s. and what it's to have economic, my concern is the economic pain that people are feeling now, quietly, is really a suffering that's not being heard. and there's echoes of that in the 20s and the 30s with the great depression. and there's a hunger for a charismatic leader. like you said, there's a leader that could walk with grace, could inspire, could bring people together with sort of dreams of a better future that's positive. but hitler did exactly everything that i just said except for the word positive, which is he did give a dream to the german people who were great people, who are great people of a better future. it's just that a certain point that quickly turned into the better future requires literally expansion of more land. it started with, well, if we wanna build a great germany, we need a little bit more land. and so we need to kind of get austria, then we need to kind of get france, mostly because france doesn't understand that more land is really useful. so we need to get rid of them. and look what they did to us in versailles anyway. but so the jewish, the holocaust is a separate thing. i don't know, well, i don't know. i don't know what to think of it because, so me being jewish and having a lot of, so the echoes of the suffering is in my family of the people that are lost. i don't know because hitler wrote all about it in mein kampf. so i don't know if the evil he committed was there all along. i mean, and that's where the question of forgiveness, i mean, hitler is such a difficult person to talk about, but it's the question of cancel culture, who is deserving of forgiveness and who is not. like the holocaust survivors that i've read about, that i've heard the interviews with, they've often spoken about the fact that the way for them to let go, to overcome the atrocities that they've experienced is to forgive. like forgiveness is the way out for them. it's interesting to think about. i don't know if we're even a society ready to even contemplate an idea of forgiveness for hitler. it's an interesting idea though. it's a good thought exercise at the very least to think about all these people that are being canceled for doing bad things of different degrees. think of louis c.k. or somebody that for being not a good person, but what is the path for forgiveness? and also what's a good person? what is a good person? if that's a sliding scale that we could all find ourselves looking at the uncomfortable end of a gun on, particularly down the line. i mean, you hope for the best, but these definitions, i guess, you said, are important and who's doing the canceling, who's being canceled. i'm not necessarily, as you said, saying that that's entirely unjustified or it's certainly understandable. and particularly you mentioned a monster, an adolf hitler, but it's also interesting. i couldn't help but notice, you mentioned as a society, us being able to apply forgiveness to someone who's done so much horror, but people who are personal, i mean, of course, many of the so many people are personally affected, but directly personally affected someone a survivor of the holocaust, being able to let go on that. i'm nowhere near big enough a person for that sort of thing. but i guess that's an interesting thing. the person who was physically there, potentially able to let go. i don't know, that's unbelievably powerful. it's interesting. i guess you have to wonder sometimes, and this isn't obviously in regards to the holocaust, but why i'm holding on to various things. have i, what is it doing for me? and what is it doing to me? is it facilitative, is it not? and i guess that's something else that i really enjoy. when i was on ultimate fighter, they don't let you have any music or any books. i've been in religious tech, so i've brought a bible and i brought a quran, and i started to read them side by side. and it was really interesting reading. the bible's a little drier, quran's more interestingly written. but i think something that was consistently brought up was the way most merciful. people want, i don't think any of us want justice. we think we want justice, but i don't think we want justice. justice is a dangerous, dangerous, dangerous game because maybe this person's wronged me deeply and i want justice. i wanna balance it out, because what is justice is not a balancing of the scales. and sometimes you can understand it, and on a societal level, i think it's fine. i mean, there's crime and punishment, and we can go for the benefits and the drawbacks of that. but i think what any of us want is mercy within reason. grace, as you mentioned, because justice is a very, very, very dangerous thing, and it's a valuable and important thing. but who gets to decide what's just, what justice is actually meted out? maybe i get to meet out justice, but i don't get my comeuppance. well, that sounds great. but what happens when it's pointed back at me? and i guess that comes back to the veil of ignorance. the idea that one day i will have to live in the world in which i've envisioned, in the world in which i've created. i think that a lot of times people love the idea of they're a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs. and i heard that the other day. i thought that was great. and i think that's a dangerous thing, and hopefully it gives us all pause before, rightly or wrongly, but always understandably, you know, wielding serious power. yeah, justice is a kind of drug. so if you look at history, also been reading a lot about stalin. i mean, all those folks really, i don't know what was inside hitler's head actually. he's a tricky one, because i think he was legitimately insane. stalin was not. and stalin was , he literally thought he's doing a good thing. he literally thought for the entirety of the time that communism is going to bring, that's the utopia, and is going to create a happy world. and in his mind were ideas of justice, of fairness, of happiness, of, of yeah, human flourishing. and that's a drug. and it somehow sadly pollutes the mind. when you start thinking that, what's good for society, and believing that you have a good sense of what's good for society, that's intoxicating, especially when others around you are feeling the same way. and then you start building up this movement, and you forget that you are just , you're barely recently evolved from an ape. like you don't know what the hell you're doing. and then you start killing witches or whatever. like you start, you start doing- they did math. let's be honest though. i mean, sometimes you got a witch has to go. a witch has, yeah, we can all agree that a witch, a witch has to go. if it floats or sinks, which one, i forget which one is. whichever one we need at the time, honestly. is it floating? it should have sunk. yeah. yeah, but yeah, we can definitely agree that witches have to go. because you brought it up, i tweeted recently, but also just, i'm one of the things i'm really ashamed of in my life is i haven't really read almost any of the sci-fi classics. really? yeah. so i, my whole journey through reading was through the literary philosophers, i would say camus, hesse, dostoevsky, kafka, that place. like that's a kind of sci-fi world in itself, but it's, it just, it creates a world in which the, the deepest questions about human nature can be explored. i didn't realize this, but the sci-fi world is the same. it just puts it in a, it removes it from any kind of historical context where you can explore those same ideas in space somewhere elsewhere in a different time, in a different place. it allows you almost more freedom to construct these artificial things where you can just do crazy, crazy kind of human experiments. so i'm now working through it. the books on my list are the foundation series by isaac asimov, dune, snow crash by neil stevenson, and ender's game, you mentioned. that's just kind of, and then, so i posted that, and then of course elon musk, john carmack, i don't know if you know him, creator of doom and quake and all that stuff. see, they all pitched in, these nerds, these ultra nerds just started going , did these, do you need to read this, that, and the other, so i've started working out, okay. but it seems the list i've mentioned holds up somewhat. is there a book, is there sci-fi books or series or authors that you find are just amazing? maybe another way to ask that is , what's the greatest sci-fi book of all time? well, i'd to start by sharing something that i'm embarrassed about, is that i haven't read anything other than, orson scott card, jr tolkien, frank herbert, tolkien, yeah. dune. yeah, i'm aware through wikipedia and through surface reading of things that a book called the republic was written once. there were some other good ones. so you read wikipedia, you're a prolific reader of wikipedia articles. well. or occasional. occasionally, exactly, and in between whatever else it is that i waste my time on. but yeah, so i also, i should say, i posted on reddit questions for ryan hall, and there's a million questions, but half of them have to do with dune. no, not really. but people bring up dune. i don't understand why. did you mention dune before? well, we actually have a showy role, actually made us a dune-themed gi one time, which i thought was kind of cool. i'll send you one, i'll give you one. we got extra. it's awesome. but actually, to your point, actually this is an orson scott card quote, actually the writer of ender's game, fiction because it's not about somebody who actually lived in the real world, always has the possibility of being about oneself. and i think that's a neat thing because i have heard other people whom i respect and very sharp people actually every now and then dig their heels and go, i don't fiction, i only nonfiction. it's more instructive. and i would go, i completely disagree with that. i think we have a hard enough time figuring out what happened at 7-11 three hours ago that let me tell you what happened 600 years bc. i'm , hey, i'm interested, but don't tell me this isn't a story too. there's factual components, i have no doubt, but we struggle sometimes to, i guess what i about fiction is that you can tell me a story, it's all about people. i mean, every now and then there's more and less believable things. and i think dune would be an unbelievably well-written, in my opinion, for what do i know, but i really dune, i'll say that, a well-written example of human beings interacting with one another, the political component to that, the emotional, the intellectual, the relationship components to all of that. and i think that dune is neat because it's a sci-fi novel, but only in the loosest sense. it's really a story about religion, about group dynamics, about human potential, about belief, learning, politics, governance, ecology. the best stories remind me of history, the same way history, hopefully, is not just a list of facts that i try to be able to recall or factoids that i try to recall, but a story that i can understand and see how the threads of time kind of came together and created certain things. and a lot of times, we say, i'm , ah, how the heck is, what's going on right now, or 100 years from now, or 100 years in the past happened? and you can look back far enough, if we had accurate knowledge, if we had that hypothetical perfect pool shot, at the beginning of time, we would see an unbroken chain of events that led us to where we are, and where we are will potentially lead us to where we're going, which is, again, why hindsight's helpful. but i think it's neat, , i guess i really enjoy, for instance, a book dune, and they're actually making a movie out of it, which i'm skeptical of, to be honest, because it's gonna be difficult to bring that to the screen for a variety of reasons, but one of the- yeah, there's at least 100 questions. ask ryan what he thinks about the new dune movie. i am not enough of an authority to have any sort of decent opinion, but i guess what i would say is, so much of it goes on in the character's mind. like, how much of any of our day, any lived experience, as it were, is internal? the majority, how many times are people walking around and, you know, they can, , hey, what do you see right now? i'm , , well, i see this picture, i see a wall. hey, there's lex. but really, what i was paying attention to was what was going on inside of my head for a moment, and almost the rest of the world tuned out and kind of dimmed, and i guess that, i think that's gonna be a struggle. to any time you wanna bring that type of a written story to a visual medium, i think it's gonna be more difficult, but it'll be interesting. it's definitely one of my favorite stories, and it's been, it's honestly helped me become better at life, in my opinion, better at martial arts, and i think the writer, i think frank herbert, was absolutely brilliant, whether those were all his ideas, which in reality, none of us, all of our good ideas aren't ours, or a combination, maybe he came up with something, you're a curator of other good ideas, and some things you borrowed from somewhere without even realizing it, but i think the way, the messages and the themes and the ideas that were conveyed, particularly in the original novel, are just absolutely brilliant. is that to you one of the greats, and the flip side of that, or another way to ask that is, if somebody's new to sci-fi, is that something you would recommend? that is an entry point. i'm not well-read enough in the sci-fi world. i haven't read a lot of isaac asimov or anything that, but i just, i'll recommend dune. i'll be an obnoxious evangelist for dune to anyone who'll listen, so i would strongly recommend it. so the other thing you mentioned, now, i should probably be talking to you about much more important things, but the other thing you mentioned is skyrim. do you play video games? what's your favorite game? what would you say is the greatest video game of all time? because i'm a huge fan of elder scrolls. oh, cool. yeah, i mean, i play a little bit at this point, a little less, finally moved into a new house. so you're an adult. no, no, no, i'm a better-funded 12-year-old. yeah, that's entirely accurate. better-funded 12-year-old, but somewhat better-funded 12-year-old. not as well-funded as i wish, but whatever. but historically, did you play video games? oh yeah, i played as a kid. and i was, again, i've always liked playing sports and liked reading, and i always enjoyed video games, but my favorite video game i think i've ever played was knights of the old republic. it was a star wars game. i'm a huge star wars fan until it became less so recently. disney. you don't the, i haven't watched it yet. mandalorian. oh, actually, i mandalorian. that was actually pretty cool, yeah. just the waving this off, canceled. yeah, i will. if i could cancel one thing, i would cancel disney star wars. i'm gonna edit that part out. okay, let's go to the next. but this is where, if people are wanting, if you're watching this on youtube and the dislike amount is 80, it's because of that comment, so good job. good job for making the internet hate you. i regret nothing. what about baby yoda? yeah, i guess, he's , he's little, he's got ears and he uses the force sometimes and he passes out. no qualms with baby yoda, yeah. you don't have a heart, okay. let's go to jiu-jitsu if it's okay. so the audience of this podcast may not know much about jiu-jitsu, or they do because it's really part of the culture now, but they don't really know much. they see that so many people have fallen in love with it, have been transformed through it, but they don't know much about , what is this thing? is there a way you could sort of try to explain what is jiu-jitsu, what is the essence of this martial art that's captured the minds and hearts of so many people in the world? i think that jiu-jitsu is a philosophy that's expressed physically and that it's the kind of development of the mental capacity and physical capacity of working in unison to move efficiently and almost flowingly, unresistingly with a given situation, with a physically resisting opponent. learning how to generate force on your own and how to steal force from the floor, how to steal force from the other person and move in concert with it as opposed to clash against, which if you watch two untrained people fight, it's almost entirely a clash. it's a runaway in clash, a runaway in clash. if you watch jiu-jitsu done well, it looks water moving around a solid structure. and i think that that is expressed physically and i think that all of the things that anyone has really been able to do very, very well in jiu-jitsu end up kind of exemplifying that. but i think that that's true of martial arts in general. i think that a lot of times, the clashing that we see going on and working well is just the fact that you get very, very physically powerful people every now and then that are able to get away with this. but i don't think that that's, and that's fantastic because ultimately it's a results driven thing. but i think that the essence of the martial arts is learning how to make more out of less and how to move with and be yielding. almost real life aikido. and... so you think of martial arts, jiu-jitsu, as water or flowing. so aikido, so moving around the force as opposed to sort of maybe the wrestling mindset is finding a leverage where you can apply an exceptional amount of force. so maximizing the application of force. i guess maybe that's a better way to, i'd to marry the two ideas, because i think you flow until the point at which you are the greater force, at which point in time you can apply. but if you look at the best wrestlers, and then when i say best, i don't necessarily mean the most successful, although of course most successful are always very, very good. throughout the course of history in boxing, in wrestling, in judo, they're magical. they disappear and reappear. it's fighting a ghost that is incorporeal when you want to find it, but then when you don't want to find it, it finds you. and i think that we see that in the buwaisar side tubes of wrestling. and i guess you could look at floyd mayweather or willie pepp or purnell whitaker in boxing as brilliant examples of disappearing and reappearing. and when you're strong, it's almost guerrilla warfare. when you're strong, i'm nowhere to be found. when you're weak, you can't get rid of me. and i think that's what we're looking for. yeah, the t.f. brothers are incredible at that. they look skinny starbucks baristas, and they just manhandle everybody effortlessly. effortlessly. they look they just kind of woke up, rolled out of bed, fighting for the gold medal at the olympics, and just effortlessly throw. there's a match against, i guess, yoh romero. yeah, so if you look at who is the guy who's intimidating in this case, and terrifying looking, it's yoh romero, just a physical specimen, and obviously a super accomplished wrestler. i think this is for the gold medal, yeah, in 2000. 2000. yeah, cindy. and then there. this is the year you all took silver. and what you, just to show you, there's a inside trip, effortless. oh gee, and he does it again. yep. you know, it's a really creative kind of wrestling where. it's organic. yeah, you throw in all these kinds of things. it's just a mix of judo, a mix of weird kind of moves. it's not as funky as ben askren. it's just legitimate, basic. well, it's not funky for funky's sake. and i'm not poking ben askren to imply that that's what he's doing, but it's funny. it's a lot of times, it's almost musashi talked a lot about that, that the only goal of combat is to win, is the outcome, it's outcome driven, versus flourishing, cool looking movements. it's , unless that had a utilitarian purpose, what are you wasting your time with that? both in the fight and also in practice. but as you mentioned, it's almost it looks judo. it looks wrestling. it looks jiu-jitsu. it's almost , i guess, that reminds me, all of the martial arts is, again, deeply tribal as well. i wanna learn lex fridman martial arts. and then i wanna learn another, i guess, transcendent person's martial arts. and it just happened to be the set of movements that you tended to do most of the time, thanks to your body type and your opposition and whatnot. but then i try to codify that and force those to work, as opposed to going, i wanna understand how the body works in concert and in congress with something else and other forces and move appropriately. and that's why it's , it always struck me that the scythe brothers are great examples of just moving water. but they, to use bruce lee, which is a little tripe, but again, he's brilliant. it's , water can flow or water can crash. and they would crash when they needed to crash. and they would flow when they needed to flow. but they would flow for the purpose of dissipating and then crash when they would win. and at the right moment, then go back to flowing the second that the other person found them. and it's just, it's beautiful to watch. it's artistic. and i think that the great expression of anything physical is ultimately studied as a science, but expressed as an art. and i think that that's something that gets lost in jiu-jitsu a lot of times when it gets a little bit, a little nerdy, do this, hand here, hand here. like, it's the more details i have, the better. when in reality, that's just not in my experience how it's done. it might be a fun exercise of saying , what are the main positions and submissions in the art of jiu-jitsu? you don't have to be complete. that's a ridiculously, i apologize for putting you on the spot this, but it might be a nice exercise to think through it. sure. i mean, i would just say that there, you have your arms bend in various ways. you have key lock americana, straight arm locks, kimura, omoplata. omoplata is a kimura. kimura is an omoplata. it's just executed. that's submissions. it's breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways. but ultimately, the question is, let's say you were a terminator, a robot that i, which of course you are. go on. go on. it's , all right, we're being completely literal. but, and i couldn't harm you with any of these things. would i still use these positions? the answer is yes. they create leverage, they create control, they create shapes that i can affect and that can affect me. and they can be affected through other forces than other objects or structures the ground or the wall. i enjoy mixed martial arts because there's another component rather than just me and you and the floor, there's me, you, the floor and the wall. and it's another player in the game that doesn't exist in a grappling context within a non-enclosed, i guess, area of combat. but you can strangle me or choke me, what do you call it, without my arms being involved or you can use one of my shoulders to pin one side of one carotid artery off and you can enclose the other. you can turn my knee in the exact same ways that you can turn my arm, straight, this way and that way. you can add a rotation to that or it can be directly linear against the joint. so i guess what i would say is the more that i've been able to understand jiu-jitsu, the more that i've been, it's given me a look into how we learn language where rather than learning five bazillion adjectives, i go, i understand what an adjective is. and of course we are all read into some degree of vocabulary. i understand what an adverb does and i understand what an adverb is. i know what a noun is. i know what the component parts of a sentence are. i know what, i guess a clause, a contraction, any of these things. and it allows you to be interesting and artistic with your language to the extent that you can. but i can't, i can speak a degree of spanish, but i'm not even slightly artistic in spanish. i would be something, i speak a child with a head injury. and anyway. your basic understanding of the english language allows you to then be a student of spanish. 100, but i'm limited by my experience. i'm limited by my understanding of techniques. i'm limited by my understanding, almost let's say techniques are vocabulary. so even if i kind of sort of grasp the sentence structure and the thought process and the thought patterns of spanish, which it's interesting because just even the orientation and the organization of a language, and i've thought about this a great deal, the way that i perceive the world is affected deeply by the language that i learned. again, if i learned, i have no idea how the chinese language structures, but i can only imagine that it would affect, it's a different lens. we're all looking at the same thing, but i have a different set of sunglasses on than you do. and that's very, very interesting. i'll use the quran as an example. apparently it's unbelievably poetic in arabic. still neat and was interesting reading in english, but i'm told by people that i trust that it just one doesn't bear resemblance to the other. and i think that's a very interesting thing that you may be able to say the same thing, but in a more, i guess in a different way, in a more artistic way that may not translate on a one-for-one kind of fidelity. but the more that we're able to understand about how the body works, the more examples of the body working this way, the body working that way, the body working that way, the more that i'm able to eventually become an artist, but it has to be studied as a science first. and it does start with technique collection, vocabulary collection, the same way we learn in school, where you remember how to say quickly 17 different ways. and let's say i speak spanish, i only know three. so you might use quickly, you might use an adjective quickly in spanish, but use one of the many, many options to describe that that i don't understand. and now i sit there and go , wait, what? i can't be artistic. i can't be as organic with the language as i'd . so i believe that jiu-jitsu a lot of times starts with the acquisition of a lot of, hey, do this, this drill, this technique, here's an americana, americana to an armlock, armlock to a triangle. but the problem with that is oftentimes we get stuck in that phase. and people eventually become move collectors or sequence collectors. and i noticed this when i'm trying to do dvds or i guess an instructional series now, or even teaching in class. i don't believe in that form of learning anymore. not that it's not valuable, but i don't believe, i don't understand jiu-jitsu on that level anymore. so what i'm trying to do is get across the basic ideas to people and say, hey, you need to fill in the gaps with going to class all the time. you need to go, hey, learn this move, learn that technique, learn that technique. because otherwise i'm basically just throwing at you 75 different words that you could use, but that hasn't really taught you how to speak a language. whereas if you give me a language structure, you can fill in these pieces on your own and then eventually speak organically in lex form, which will be ultimately unique to you because otherwise you just end up being a weird facsimile of whatever it is that i'm doing for mostly the worst i'd say. but- yeah, that's what people, i mean, people comment, is this, especially people who haven't listened to me before, is this guy drunk or high? does he, does mit really allow slow people to be- quotas. quotas, yeah. like what's wrong with him? is he getting sleep? are you okay? does he need help? so that's similar with my jiu-jitsu is , is this guy, is this guy really, whatever rank i was throughout, i remember just , is this guy really this rank? i just have a very kind of certain way of sitting and being slow and lazy looking that there was ultimately the language that i had to discover. and it was, yeah, it was a very liberating moment, i think, of probably a few years of getting my ass kicked, especially with open guard and butterfly to where you really allow yourself to take in the entirety of the language and realize that i'm not, i'm a unique, i'm unique and i have a very, i have a language, i have a set of techniques, a way i move my body that needs, that i'm the one to discover. like it's, you can only, you can learn specific techniques and so on, but you really have to understand your own body. and that's the beautiful thing about jiu-jitsu, you said, is the connection about your philosophy, your view of the world with the physical and connecting those two things, how you perceive the world, how you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion, about force, about effortlessness, what it really means to relax, all these kinds of loose concepts, and then actually teach your body to do those things and , you know, and be able to apply force and spurts, be able to relax and spurts, and figure all that stuff out for my, for my individual body. but it's, as you mentioned, that's, i couldn't agree with you more, it's a discovery process and no one can cheat that process, which is at the same time, it's almost imagine i wanna start writing books in second grade, unless maybe i'm staggeringly brilliant, which i can only conceptualize someone being able to do that, but maybe a mozart of the english language where you're out there doing it. but for most of us, we don't have enough knowledge, enough information, enough experience to be able to be, to express ourselves. so we have to basically input, repeat, which is important, but it's the process as you say of going through that, of getting your ass kicked, or just , well, that didn't work, well, that didn't work, that felt right, but i don't know, nobody else does that, i guess i don't believe in that. versus eventually going, i don't know, i'll just try going my own way and see what happens, and now i'll get yelled at and people won't me, and if it works, they'll say i got lucky, and if it doesn't work, they'll say i was dumb, but which maybe all is right. but basically, you know, going through that iterative process that allows you to eventually find your self-expression and find your voice so that you fight the same way that you speak, the same way that you write, the same way that you think in a way that is uniquely you, that will also ultimately allow you to understand other people being uniquely them, because even if you can only conceptualize, and i think about this a lot for society stuff, where i go, well, this is how i feel about this, but am i objectively right? maybe about a couple of things, but that's a small box that i have to be very, very careful about what i think is objective versus what's not, and i have to be open to the possibility that all the things that i think are objectively correct may or may not be, and that should allow me to have some degree of compassion or consideration for other people, both in their martial arts journey and in their journey, you know, as people, as human beings, because i understand that they're on a, it's a, we're all on a path where it's all, and again, an iterative process of eventual self-expression, but i think that's one of the things that we see having trouble when we see tribalism, which i mean, racism expression of that, political affiliation to expression of that, all of these things that can go in really uncomfortable directions. people are looking for, hey, where do i plant my feet over here? where's the thing that i know is right? and we can all agree on the following, and i think that we see that in martial arts, we're , , i do this style, i do that style, i do that style, it's , hey, man, we're all just pushing forward in a certain direction here, trying to do our best, and i understand why you feel the way you do. i may have felt that at one point too, but you know, i'm just trying to learn and understand versus i've already acquired enough knowledge, let me cross my arms and start to look who's fucking up around here, and i think that it's an interesting trap that i think is very human trap to fall into, but it definitely happens early on. it's a joke in the jiu-jitsu world, right? like, , the blue belt that knows everything. well, initially it's , what, i know nothing, and i at least think i know nothing. then i learn a little bit, and i think it's a lot bit, and then the more you learn, the more you go , i don't even know what i'm doing. yeah, that's exactly right. we kinda talked about it a little bit, but once again, a lot of people that listen to this have never been on the mat, have never tried jiu-jitsu, but are really curious about it. everybody at all positions, i think elon musk's kids are not doing jiu-jitsu, andrew yang is, they're all, you know, the world is curious. it's a nice, it seems to be a nice methodology by which to humble your ego, which to grow intellectually and physically. so people are curious about it. so the natural question is, if they're curious about it, how would you recommend they get started? maybe , what do you recommend the first day, week, month, year, first couple years look ? like, how do you ease into it and make sure that it's a positive experience and you progress in the most optimal and positive way? the first thing you can do is simply ask yourself why. why you wanna be involved. you know, i remember the first day that i walked into ronan athletics in new york city to train under godfather of my son now, christian montes. and i didn't know what i was getting myself into. i played baseball through high school and i was at manhattan college in the bronx and i wanted to go and learn martial arts because it was always something that was interesting to me, but it was never something that i knew was accessible. and it definitely wasn't really around in northern virginia where i grew up, whereas then you stick yourself in manhattan and there's stuff everywhere. so anyway, i guess i didn't know what to expect. i didn't know if i was gonna get beat up, if people were gonna be nice, people were not gonna be nice. but what i began with was, i think, expectation management. and i think that that's something that i would, that'd be the first thing that i would start is almost imagining what is it that i'm getting myself into? because i love the martial arts, martial arts has given me everything in life and i'm so thankful i wouldn't be sitting here without that experience, that journey, the people that i've met, the places that i've gone, i could never, ever have ever imagined. and i'm just unbelievably thankful for that. but i think that the thing that helped me most of all was starting with going, my mom said something to me one time and she said, there's two types of people in various situations. there's why and there's why not. and it's understandable to have questions, concerns, things that. but maybe sometimes it's a little bit easier when you're younger to just trust people or just say, i don't know, you know, but we go, hey, you wanna climb that rock? i'm , yeah, why not? let's go. hey, you wanna jump in that river? yeah, why not? sure. versus if i have to reason my way into everything, if i have to be talked into everything, a lot of times i'll talk myself out of it. and i think that a lot of times, this is the thinker's disease. you wanna figure out what's gonna happen and what you should expect to have happen before you get involved versus going, using the old bruce lee saying, again, it's no amount of thinking or training on the side of the river will teach you how to swim. you have to jump in. and there are risks associated with that. and so, i guess, psychological are usually the biggest ones. that's the biggest hurdle. and physical. but the biggest thing that i guess i would suggest anyone to say, well, why do you wanna do this? you're , well, i wanna challenge myself. i wanna learn, i would to learn to fight. i want to learn to fight so that i could protect myself. and if anything else, other people, if only within arms reach, i perceive that if i had some small degree of power, i generally wouldn't use it, which is why i was , yeah, i'll give it a try. i'll try to be reasonable. and hopefully if i make a mistake, i'll apologize to people. but basically, i said, yeah, i'd to have that. and i know this is gonna be challenging and we'll see what happens. and that means that getting beat up, and i didn't get hurt, but getting roughed up, getting my arm bent this way or that way, getting choked. i was , well, this is all supposed to happen. that's no big deal. it would be going and joining the army during peacetime and then going, , i'm just doing this for a college education. you're , okay, that's cool, man. and then all of a sudden war breaks out and they wanna send me somewhere. and i'm , whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, i didn't sign up for that gig. actually you did, whether you realize it or not. you may not have thought that you did, but you did. so getting your mind right and just going, what are my expectations of this activity? what is it that i'm looking to do? and of course, you're going into a gym, you're going into a place that you don't know people or you probably don't know people and you don't know the coach. and even if you do wanna, hey, how you doing? shake your hand type of level, 95 of my students don't know me, not really. i'll try to be polite and not annoy them too much, but they don't know me and i don't know them. i understand if they don't trust me, i wouldn't trust trust me either if i were them. but at the same time, someone has to take that leap. and one of the things that i've noticed as a martial arts instructor, that's the biggest struggle with dealing with adults, which is why a lot of people to teach kids is because kids don't ask, don't argue. now that also means there's all sorts of pitfalls with that sort of thing and that can be an issue. but i guess a lot of times people get to a point in their life, in their 20s, early 30s, where now i'm a manager now, i know what i'm doing. no one talks to me that versus , hey man, you go join bootcamp, i don't care if you are elon musk, they're gonna tell you to shut up and do pushups. and that's what's great about it. so you are taking a leap of faith into a world that you're gonna be a tiny fish. and you gotta hope that the people who are guiding you in that journey are gonna have, i can't say even say your best interests at heart because they don't even know you, but they'll try to do no harm and they'll try to help you in the way that they would understand. and i guess that's, for instance, that's what i would try to do with anyone that comes into my gym. i would try to help them in the way that i understand they need as best i can and as safe and reasonable a way as possible. but sometimes in a way that's gonna make them uncomfortable, particularly if physical combat and it's not something they've done before. if they've, a lot of people go in without even having played contact sports. and so that can be a big jump and you have to understand if that's where you're starting from, no worries, but you're gonna have to kind of work your way to it and it's gonna be uncomfortable and that's okay. it's part of the process and you're gonna have some bumps and bruises and you're not gonna wanna roll with that guy in the corner because that person's rough and they beat you up and they're , okay, but is this a big hurt or is it a little hurt? if it's a big hurt, okay. if it's a little hurt, shh. need you to soldier up a little bit. yeah, it's such an interesting balance because to find, i think one of the most important things as in anything i think in life is the selection of the people that you put around you. i mean, that's true with getting married. that's true with if you go to, if people ask me graduate students, your phd advisor can be the difference. it's everything. it's you spend five years with somebody, they're going to basically define more impact on you than anybody you marry, anybody you hang out with. it's a huge impact. and the same with the coach selection, which is the school selection is going to be really important about in terms of who you select will define how happy, the trajectory of your growth and how happy you are with the entirety of the experience. and yet the flip side of that is, especially if you have an ego, especially if you are the manager that needs to let go of some stuff, you're going to feel shit with the best kind of coach. that's what you need. but there's a weird balance there to find. like, i mean, , and everybody needs a different thing. like i'm much more, i enjoy being sort of , it sounds weird, but i'm, you know, from the wrestling background, i enjoy feeling crap in the sense the coach, getting beat up. i don't actually enjoy it. it's not some masochistic thing or whatever. i know what you mean. it's the growth. like i the anxiety. i feeling shit when i go home, emotionally, physically, it's it's growth. it's a sign of growth, right? like if you're not having to feel those things, you're probably in your comfort zone, which is fine, but that's not your growth zone, right? and everybody has a different threshold for that. and i mean, the beautiful thing about jiu-jitsu is , it's also has a yoga feel to it. like you're learning about your body. so depending on the gym and depending on, in fact, the coaches, the people around you, within the gym, you can select little groups too, kind of . the people with who you roll, if you're a smaller person, it doesn't mean you have to go against big people. you can go against the people who smoke a lot of weed and they're chill, or you can go against that crazy ripped blue belt competitor who's out to destroy everybody. and depending on what your mindset is, you can kind of select that. it's such a fascinating journey of basically self-discovery. i couldn't agree with you more. it's been what you need may change over time, right? maybe what you needed, what you need today could change six months from now or a year from now. and that's something that i experienced. i'll use my first coach, christian, again, as a great example of someone who i really look up to and respect and someone who helped me a lot. like at a time when i really needed some guidance, and i needed to learn martial arts, but get into... hensel gracie's gym was right down the street from where christian was teaching. and christian was a blue belt at the time. he was teaching at a place called fight house, which is this awesome 90s, early 2000s, warehouse area down on fashion avenue in manhattan off of between seventh and eighth. and it was two basketball courts wide, but there was the samba guys over here. there was the kali guys over there. there was wing chun over there. there was jiu jitsu in the corner. and hensel's was one of the most famous academies in the world at that time, still is. and i just didn't know what hensel gracie was. and i mean, it's a great gym and it's a fantastic place for people to train. but i think what was right for me at the time was to, i stumbled into a two person elevator up and found a place where six people trained at that time. and i had someone that could give me some, in addition to martial arts advice, personal guidance. and that made a big difference. and then when initially we would have competitions or intra gym competitions with the samba guys, we would roll with them. and , again, it was great. cause they were just a bunch of russian dudes from brighton beach and they would come down and then we would all fight and then everyone would train and we'd all drink tea and then go home. and anyway, what was- oh, russians. it was super tough. and they were , again, just a tough group of people. it was great. and then i remember when i decided after four or five months, i'm , man, i really wanna try to take this seriously. and i told christian about that. and he's , well, hey, i think you need to do the following. and it was, you know, , hey, there was a guy named jeff ruth, who was a purple belt at the time, which was a much bigger deal than it is now, but it was 10 and always an mma fighter, a lot of amateur box spirit, super tough dude. and jeff was the best person at that time that i'd ever trained with. and i just got squashed. christian used to beat me up too, but jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me. and i was , this is awesome. and this was back when i was at home. i went home for the summer for that. and chris was , hey, i think you should stay. because i told him that's what i was thinking. and this was a coach that, you know, when initially was exactly what i needed. and then he's , well, hey, that's not what i'm doing here. maybe they're gonna be able to help you onto a path that's kind of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment. and then, you know, that was an interesting thing. and i really got, i feel that i was fortunate to start at a place where my coach was able to transition roles and do so comfortably. and i think that that also was probably a factor of the fact that, you know, where he'd done some of his training prior, there've been issues with the coach there. we're not supporting, not having the support, you know, feeling , hey, i'm gonna hold onto my students. i'm gonna hold onto my best guy or my best girl even if i can't take them where they need to go. so that was an interesting thing. and just recognizing also though, that the people, the same way you're an individual going into a gym and you don't know what you're getting into, your coach is a person too. and he or she, you know, they may have been doing this activity longer than you, but they're not, they're not some weird little, you know, all-knowing god. they don't know anything. they may say something that pisses you off. they may, they may yell at you. they may help you. they may inadvertently cause you some sort of, you know, some sort of issue and just being able to recognize that even though i say this to people and i've said this to people in my gym, i'm , you know, we're in the service industry, man, but i'm not at your service. like don't get it twisted. like i will absolutely do my best to help people. i'm there to do my best as a martial arts coach, but i'm here to do my best as a martial arts coach. and i'll do my best and periodically i make mistakes and i owe an apology or two and i'll try to give them out when i can. but we're not mcdonald's. it's not, , you gave me a hundred bucks so you do whatever you want in here. this is my house. this is my gym. this is my dojo. this is, this is the martial arts. this is not a basketball team. yeah, there's something beautiful about martial arts. like exactly as you said, is the coach, in wrestling and at least collegiate, high level wrestling, it's , there's a dictatorship aspect to a coach that is very important to have. like this ridiculous sometimes nature of master and so on and bowing all these traditions. there's something, it seems ridiculous from the outside perhaps, but there's something really powerful to that. because that process of you said, why not, of letting go of the leap of faith requires you to believe that the coach has your best interest in mind and just give yourself over to their ideas of how you should grow. and that's an interesting thing. i mean, i've never been able to really see coaches i've had as human. they're always, you're always, it's a father figure or this, you always put them in this position of power. and i think that's, i think at least for me, it's been a very, it's been a very useful way to see the coach because it allows you to not think and let go and really allow yourself to grow and emotionally deal with all the beatings. they'll push you where past oftentimes where you would have stopped yourself, right? which is great. and then hopefully they know if they're paying attention and they're still a person, they can make mistakes, but they'll push you further than you would have gone, but not so far that it's not facilitative, right? that's something that i can say faraz zahabi, the head coach at tristar, my head coach for mma, kenny florian, one of the other head coaches for mma, have both been phenomenal influences. paul schreiner, who's one of the assistants at marcelo garcia's academy, coached me in jiu-jitsu for a long time, brilliant instructor, they've all been able to do that. and i think what's interesting about all of those guys, they're very sharp, but they're very intuitive as well. and i think that faraz actually, you know, told me about something that john wooden said, john wooden, the legendary ucla basketball coach, just a simple philosophical idea, just he said, some people's life is a bowl of shit. it needs some whipped cream in it. some people's life is a bowl of whipped cream, needs a little bit of shit in it, just to balance it out. and it's an interesting thing, coaching everyone the same way doesn't work. you know, that's, i think the difference between a coach and an instructor. and a lot of times people think they wanna coach, but they really want an instructor. i'm , hey, lex, tell me what to do, not how to do it. and then other times people think they want, you know, an instructor and they really wanna coach. i'm , man, this guy's just giving me information. a coach is so much more than an instructor. and that's a huge leap. and that's something that i think that people need to understand when they're going into martial arts. and i understand, and i can totally grasp why they don't, because how would they know? but i think about this a lot, me giving you $150 for a month, which is not nothing, that's for sure. that does not, that pays for instructor really. coach is a relationship that gets developed. because can you imagine, just the amount of emotional investment and time thinking away from , , alex isn't here anymore, but what can i do to help him? what does he need? like that's serious. and that's the difference between, that's oftentimes the difference that getting over the hump in various situations. so it's an interesting, you know, bargain that's being made, commitment by the instructor who becomes a coach, commitment by the student, you know, there's a financial transaction. there's a lot of things going on there, but i feel very fortunate to have had, not just instructors in my time, but coaches. and that means sometimes we've butted heads. and sometimes i look back and i think i was right. and other times i look back on my own, no, they were definitely right. but there was always the trust, with the exception of one time that i feel that trust was greatly betrayed, that rightly or wrongly, whether mistakes, mistakes will be made, but everyone is attempting to do the right thing under no circumstances would i intentionally do anything malicious, you know, versus, hey, i might've done, i might've burnt your house down, but you can be darn sure it wasn't on purpose. and i think that as long as there's that mutual understanding and mutual belief of goodwill, which again, doesn't just magic up out of nowhere, i understand, i think that that's when then great things can happen. and i look at all the athletes that i know, you know, the guys and girls that i've watched become fantastic in various places, almost invariably, it never happened alone. yeah, you know, i'm really torn about that. like maybe you can help. have you seen the movie whiplash? mm-mm. so it's, i would say from an outsider's perspective, people should watch it. it's, i guess jazz band, it's a movie about a drummer and the instructor. and he, it's a basically, i would say, from the outsider's perspective, it's a toxic relationship, but he's really the coach, whatever we call him, pushes the musician, the drummer to his limits, to where he just feels shit emotionally. it's a, it looks a toxic relationship, but it's one that ultimately is very productive for the improvement of the musician. i have the same, in my own experience, i had, i got a chance to train at a couple of places regularly and so one of my coaches, who is a great human being, a lot of people love him, but when i was a blue belt, he was pushing me a lot for competition. and every time i step on the mat, i was anxious and almost afraid of training because of the places i'm gonna have to go. and then the, i can't, i don't know what's good or bad because i think i've become a better person because of that experience. like i needed that. and on the flip side, the place i got my black belt from, it's balance studios, i remember also a blue belt, the coach sitting down and i was going to competition and he saw something in me where he said, you know, good luck, but win or lose, we always love you. like i remember that because i really needed that at that time. like i was putting so much pressure on myself. like i'm not an actual professional competitor, you know? i just competed, i'm a phd student, but it was clearly having a psychological effect on me. and that's what a great coach does is , you know, it's life is more important than jiu jitsu since it's bigger. so they find, you use jiu jitsu when you need it to grow as a person. and when it overwhelms you, you have to pull that person out. like look at the bigger picture, always look at the bigger picture. it's fascinating. and i don't know what to make of it. i don't think i would have it any other way is both the anxiety and the love. yeah. i think that i couldn't, that's a really interesting thing that you're describing that i guess it kind of brings me back to a lot of the other things we've been discussing is just almost the reciprocal nature of everything where no pressure, that's great. everyone's happy all the time. it's either, i mean, let's use an example of sci-fi movies, let's say the matrix, which of course the first one was amazing and then each subsequent movie made the series worse. but basically- they're working on a new one by the way. yeah, i've heard. we'll see, we're hoping for the best. but basically, you know, let's say, hey, we started with our first initial world, agent smith says to neo, he's our first world was a utopia where everyone was happy and nothing ever went wrong. it's your primitive cerebrum rejected it. and i think that there's obviously, i mean, what do i think? but i guess, well, i'm here, so i might as well say what i think. i guess, you know, great things are fantastic. a kind, gentle place is fantastic. and this is again why i love dune because i think dune does such a great job of expressing, frank herbert does such a great job of expressing, again, the reciprocal nature of these ideas. you know, look at sparta, for instance, or at least what i understand of sparta from the reading and also watching 300. you know- and reading the wikipedia article. and reading the wikipedia article about the movie, not the place. but it's, that's a hard, brutal place. and that was there benefit to that? like, absolutely. was there drawback to that? absolutely. is it sustainable? i should, i would think probably not. i mean, granted it hasn't sustained, but i mean, that type of a thing, it burns too hot almost, and it destroys the host at a certain point. and, you know, i guess that type of unforgiving nature, but entirely permissive has its own issues. and i guess coming back to what your description of describing a toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it's almost , it's bird's eye view, me. you know, you see, let's say a husband and a wife arguing. they're , all right, well, sort of somebody hitting somebody. i need to keep myself out of this because i have no idea what, i'm seeing something, but i don't know what's going on or why specifically. and again, short of it going to a place that's just out of bounds. i don't know who's right here. i don't know who's wrong. and i don't know what phase of this things are in. so i guess- and long-term what's good for both people. right, it's dangerous for it. so if i want to put my finger on the scale, i can understand the desire to do them. i'm , hey guys, let's break it up. but, and that may be the right thing at the time, but at the same time, i'm not sure. so i think back to all of the times that, you know, that you mentioned, your coach pushing you when it's very, very hard. and then other times going , hey, let's put it in perspective here. i think that's an interesting thing for high performance. and i think that we're seeing that again, societally, you know, now, or at least maybe that's, it just pops up on my internet feed periodically. but coaches shouldn't be allowed to do this or yell at this person to yell at that person. like, well, have you ever been, go to a boxing gym. it's not a commercial entity, not really. i have real boxing, not la boxing, not a ufc gym. like a real place. you're going to see what things are when it's entirely performance based. go to a wrestling room at a high level. you know, again, there's left and right limits and there are such things, obviously as abuse, of course, but, and that should never be tolerated. but it's not a commercial entity. i don't need to be sweet to you if you're screwing up, if you're dropping the ball and in fact, recognizing that i'm not doing you a favor or the team a favor by being permissive of that type of behavior, i think is important. everything in its context and at its time is important. and i guess i can think again of the times that i've been put or had put on me, a great deal of pressure to do x, y, or z or to succeed or to push for success. and i can't look back fondly enough on those times. they were tough at the time, but without that, i'm not sitting here. without that, i don't go from growing up in a very nice family in the suburbs to fighting at the highest level in jiu-jitsu, gi, nogi, and now in mixed martial arts, starting a career at age 27. you know, it just doesn't happen because people generally speaking from that background don't get pushed hard enough physically to be able to make that transition. and that has benefits and it has drawbacks. you know, when you stare into the abyss, it stares back. and i think that that's an important thing to understand. you know, you stare long enough, you can become something that you don't, that you would be sorry that you did. you don't look enough and you don't have perspective either. you know, and i think that that's an interesting thing. i can speak to someone who's relatively articulate and reasonable, i try to be reasonable, but you know, i'll say inspiring. if people get crazy with me, they get a warning and then i'm a crack them. and what did they expect? oh, they hear the guy on an interview, but who did they think they were meeting? cause there's also the guy in the ring. and there's layers there too. i remember training with you, it was kind of funny. there was , there's, well, you didn't know who i was. i mean, you still , i have a really good strain ankle out by the way. yeah, that, so i don't remember what rank i was, but it might've been purple or something that. and i did some, i, you had this look on your face, which i've often seen in black belts. it's , here he goes again. like here's him trying this thing. and then when i kind of annoyed you a little bit with it, now i get that it was a good, , i, you know, i did something somewhat effective, some, maybe a little bit off balance. yeah. there's, i just peeled off a little layer of ryan hall to where i was , okay, let me, let me , there's layers underneath. the dog is mike tyson somewhere in there. like, so it was , okay, this new guy rolls in here. he thinks he can do the stupid thing. and then, and then you started to beat the hell out of me. but the point is there's layers here from the guy who was being interviewed now to genghis khan. but it's, but it's fine. it's all in the same body. right, but it's , all of us are that, right? in various different directions and recognizing that's okay. it's just, there are consequences to all, every choice that we make has a consequence. sometimes there's objectively wrong or objectively right. but at least in my mind, that's a pretty small box. everything else is just, there's a consequence to that. do you that consequence? do you not? and who do i wanna become? what do i wanna try to hone myself or anyone else into? and also , but this is something i've screwed up as a coach plenty of times. you know, if someone says, if you're, if i come to them lex, i really, really wanna take, you know, research very seriously. like, okay, i believe you. now i haven't shown you that, but i believe you. like, okay, and now me not showing up to research or to study or not being up until three in the morning thinking about this is no longer acceptable. there was a time five seconds before me making that statement that if i went to bed without reading the book that i needed to read, no worries. but the second that i made that statement, your expectations for me changed. and maybe it's something that's something that i've screwed up a whole bunch of times in my, as a teacher. cause it's an interesting thing, obviously, you know, being a running a martial arts school as your principally an athlete is sometimes i don't pay enough attention to what people are doing. i just go, , okay. you say x, y, z. i'm , roger that. i believe you, cool. i will now put you in category x. and whether rightly or wrongly, maybe this person didn't understand what they were asking for, or i didn't express this or the other end. it just, it caused cross wires. and then most of the times you just, you hash it out. you have a discussion. you figure out, you get to the bottom of what people are trying to do or what they want. but if i was paying more attention, i think i could have been a lot more effective. or if i had more experience and sometimes maybe i'm not sharp enough or i don't perc, i'm not perceptive enough to be able to, to see what's going on. and maybe with years more down the line, i'll be able to have a sharper perception. but i think that's another one of those interesting things that some, that sometimes i would caution or not caution, but just inform a prospective martial arts student, depending upon where you're going. you know, this, you, both you and also your coach or other people in the room, they wear many hats. and sometimes there's a, i had the wrong hat on. you were talking to me as lex the guy. i didn't realize you were talking to me. i thought you were talking to me as lex the guy. i didn't realize you're talking to me as lex the martial artist. i'm , crap. i was talking to the wrong person. so it's almost if you had a, i run my gym with my wife, she's a black belt. so she's my wife. she's my peers as a martial artist in jiu-jitsu. like here by the way, in judging. so exactly. all right. well, so, but a fellow black belt. and i guess another thing, she doesn't have a microphone. so you can't hear all the trash she's talking. exactly. but it can be tough. and that's something that we've had to work through a lot. and it's looking back and it's now being where i'm at now. and it's easy for me to say that cause she's in the room and i don't want her to stab me, just continue to slowly poison me over time. which frankly i understand. it's the sort of thing that is now way more effective than anything else i could really reasonably expect to have. but there were times when both of us were justifiably annoyed at the other because of crossed wires. and sometimes you just have disagreement anywhere or misunderstanding anyway. but again, i coach some of my friends. i coach my friend who i've known since i was four years old. sometimes i don't go, hey buddy, how you doing? sometimes i was , what the fuck are you doing? put your hand over there. how many times have we talked about this? and then you walk away and you can see him look at you crooked and you're , crap. oh yeah, he thought i was talking to him as his friend. yeah, well, all right, we need to talk this one out, hash it out and not, he's wrong. how could he possibly think that way? like, no, i totally understand that. but if i was 22, doesn't he know i'm a purple belt? some nonsense that. and it doesn't come from a bad place, but it's just, i guess that comes back to society, to anything people only have the perspective that they have and the awareness that we have. and so again, going back and going, hey guys, grace, i don't expect, it's not fair for me to go, i fight ufc. why doesn't this guy who came in as an attorney understand how hardcore this needs to be? and , how could he? and at the same time though, if i'm using the language of someone that is interested in at least performance from a martial arts perspective, i understand how that could be off putting, let's say for instance, someone that's , all of that will be out of bounds in their normal workplace. but if they think of the gym as my office, then whether they agree or disagree with what's going on, they go, okay, i see why that might've happened. let's talk about this. and we can, again, all push forward in a positive direction that benefits, i guess, everyone's journey throughout the activity. and on top of all that, there's moods, okay? i mean, especially lately, i think two days ago, maybe yesterday, no, two days ago, i've never been that cranky in my life. i think, i don't know what it was, but i wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me. it was , i was just very conscious of this feeling of , why is this happening right now? so i consciously decided, as i usually do in those cases, to not say anything to anybody. how do you do that? well, you know, it's, yeah, meditate, because it's not, i tend to then visualize what's gonna happen in the next, how is this gonna make my life better? like, if i say something that mean to somebody else, i have just started a conflict that will just escalate, will continue, will add more conflict to my life. it'll make things, i just don't the feeling it will create. and so you live enough life to know that , it's just with street fighting. you know, i would get into a lot of fights when i was younger, just on the street, but then you realize , it's not a jujitsu match or something that. it's not, it'll escalate. it might come back at you. it'll , that person might find you again, but more importantly, the anxiety of it, of having created little enemies in this world, distorts the way you see the world. so i've noticed that , if i am shitty to people on the internet, which i haven't been, i think in a long time, is , it somehow brings the shittiness to you more and more, it escalates. like the more love you put out there, the more the people who put love out, surround you. well, you mentioned forgiveness as well. like you said, , i guess back to the original, you know, the holocaust survivor scenario, where , my god, you think of the ultimate in , i've never experienced one billionth of that level of pain and horror. and it's , and i can't let this little thing go. you know, i guess that's an interesting thing. i think you're just making the point in your personal life, i guess the same way, right? yeah, they're, yeah. and on the internet, it's hard. i've somehow gotten, i mean, you've had a level of celebrity for a while. i've recently gotten some level of celebrity. and these people who are just shitty for no reason come out from all places, calling me a fraud or anything else. i mean, it's- it was a j.n. simon bob, strike back. they find out a movie is gonna be made about them and people are talking shit on the internet. and they're , what's the internet? and then someone shows them and they're , what? and they go to a message board and they go to hollywood to try to stop it from being made. and they eventually get money for their likeness and they use the money to buy plane tickets and fly around and beat the shit out of all the people that talk bad about them. yeah, it's tough. i mean, i'm having trouble with it because there's people , yeah, there's posts and forums and heated discussions about is lex fable a fraud? i don't know. what has he really done? and then there's people , well, i think he's an all right guy, but i'm not sure. like there's literal discussions. and i'm , if you increase the level of celebrity, there's going to be , one of the things that hurts my heart a little bit is some level of toxicity around joe rogan, for example. there's communities of people that now talk about him selling out, for example, all that kind of stuff. and i don't, you know, and joe, i've talked to him about it is amazing that he, he says, don't read the comments. he legitimately doesn't read the comments. his heart and his soul doesn't give a damn about the comments. all he gives a damn about is his friends. like one of the things that's really inspiring to me and that's, i've had a conversation with them offline about spotify and the removed episodes. people are curious. what's spotify? it's a thing on the internet where i think you can play taylor swift songs on. i'll write that down. but you can also now play joe rogan podcast. oh, cool. and they gave him a hundred million dollars. so that's, you know, that's, that's awesome. it's yeah. but the thing i've had a discussion with him and i made a video about it that i took down because the toxicity is , it's hard to put into words but he will give away the hundred million in a second if he ever has to compromise who he is. like he doesn't, i mean, he already said, as he talked about, he's made quote unquote, fuck you money a long time ago. he doesn't need any more money. he doesn't care. it's nice to have money, whatever, but he'll give it away. so the, it's nice to see when people him at a level of celebrity, level of success and financial success, don't change at all. they're just the same thing that makes you happy is talking in his case, talking shit with his friends in case of most of us really, just hanging out with friends, doing the things you love. in his case, doing the things he loves without any, , you know, the texas way, the freedom, without any corporate bureaucracy bullshit that rolls in and says, well, maybe you shouldn't say fuck, you know, more than 20 times a podcast or something that. like those kinds of rules, people, he says in a suit and tie, they show up and say stuff. oddly enough, people that could never have done what he's done. yeah, exactly. and it's kind of inspiring to see that. and i hope people, i hope people realize how special of a human he is. he's inspired people me, i'm just, i'm a scientist, right? so he inspired somebody me from a very different walk of life to be kind to others, to be open-minded. i don't know, that is a special dude. so people need to support that and treasure that as opposed to, as opposed to be toxic about it. i mean, what, people really for a long time have told me that it would be awesome if ryan halls goes on joe rogan. i definitely think that would be an awesome thing. have you listened to joe? has he been a part of your life in some kind of way? well, joe's always, i remember watching joe on fear factor when i was a little kid, which is cool. so i've actually gotten a from a bird's eye view, watch his kind of just path through life. but one of the things that i always appreciate, and again, i barely know joe or then to shake his hand, he interviewed me after the briefing in the ring after the bj penn fight. but one of the things that i've always admired about joe is that i think he had fucking money from the start. i think that $0 is fucking money for joe. i think, and that's something i respect about him a great deal, because as you say, it's interesting to watch. it's you hope that george st. pierre's this. it's really neat. i'm not super close to george, but we're teammates at tristar, and he's never been anything but a gentleman. he's one of those people that if you didn't know george was famous when you walk into the gym, you'd have no idea. he's not holding court, not doing it. he's just training, and he'll help out an amateur doing this. if you have a question for him, he'll help me. like i'm nobody, man. he would give me advice and train me. it was super cool. he didn't kill me, which i really appreciated. he's a gentleman. but it's you meet someone and you go, man, it's so cool that this is the guy who's the best, that this is the guy who has been successful. and then you go, why are they successful? like i said, true to what they're doing. they haven't changed. they're the same as they've been. and i remember i got to tristar in 2012, and george was already george st. pierre. but i remember watching and talking to people, and they're , man, george is the same as he's always been, and it's neat. i see him in the gym training now, and again, giving advice now. and it seems joe has always been consistent, and it's neat to watch someone not compromise on their values and not change who they are. and periodically, again, we all make mistakes. like you have a bad day or this or that, and an apology needs to be issued, or even my bad or this or that. and again, they just move on. they're not afraid to be themselves, and they're not afraid to be wrong. they're not afraid to make a mistake. as you mentioned, open-mindedness. i'm , so what are the correct beliefs to have about this that i know going in, everyone's gonna be okay with what i'm saying? which is usually the beginning of a conversation that's gonna go nowhere, right? and it's neat to see the things, i guess, that he's created on his own as a result of the authenticity that's there. and it reminds me of dave chappelle. and again, i don't know, i've never met dave, but it's neat to see someone that's clearly, again, authentic in their own way, doing their own thing. and because of that, they're above the corporate nonsense. but what's funny, i think the message behind all of it is, hey guys, we all are. i can't promise you that i'm gonna have money. joe couldn't promise you that he's gonna have money. now it ended up working out, but he was above that nonsense from the jump. and he just continued to be above it by never giving it any mind and just going , yeah, i'm gonna be a reasonable person. i'm gonna try to learn, i'm gonna try to grow. and if i say something annoying, you can come and talk to me about it. we can get to the bottom of it. and i'm , if i need to say my bad, thanks, appreciate it. you know, i will. and if i don't need to, i'm , hey, i still appreciate the talk, thanks, man. shake your hand and we carry on. and we go our separate ways and hopefully i'll treat you with respect, you treat me with respect. and that's about it. and i guess, i think it's a lesson that it can work out no matter what. you don't have to kowtow to these weird powers that be. and whether you're at this level or at this level, but you can live your life the way that you want. and as you mentioned, talk to your friends, hang out, be happy. and it just so happens that that resonates with people. it actually reminds me of speaking at mit and being in boston is a goodwill hunting. you know, , again, that's what do they really wanna do? he could have gone this way, he could have gone that way. and it was an interesting story, but it's , this person wants to hang out with his buddies and wants to do other things. and again, happens to be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these other things. but there was, i guess it's at least in my mind, a story of authenticity as well. and it was both the same thing in the robin williams character. and i just think that that's a message because watching things occur on the internet as they do now, so many things playing out in the public eye. i feel so many private or otherwise formerly private discussions and disputes and interactions now become, they all have a, well, what is this gonna say when it goes public? so how can i couch what i'm saying? or how can i word this in a way that's gonna get people on my side or use the right buzzwords or not use the wrong buzzwords? and it's just neat to see people, you know, in their own way, flip the bird to the head. because i just think that that's just not how a human being is meant to think or interact. i'm curious what you think about the thing that recently has, you know, me hosting this podcast, i sometimes think about , who should i talk to and not in terms of , it's the old hitler question. now hitler i would definitely talk to because, post world war ii, because everyone knows he's evil. the question whether you talk to hitler in 1937, when people who are really students of what's going on understand that this is a very dangerous human being. but large part of the world are , well, he's a leader who cares for germany. so the question i have, it's interesting to me, it involves a particular person named, who also lives in austin, texas, named alex jones. i don't know if you're familiar with the guy. i am familiar with mr. jones. i've actually recently just listened to infra wars, one episode of his show, i guess, that he does every day. and it kind of reminded me of a time in college when i drank too much tequila. like there's no turning back. like, it's , the mistakes you make that , i mean, you don't know where you're gonna wake up. you don't know who you're gonna kill or not kill or steal or rob. it's unclear. so it felt i was getting pulled into a dark place where pretty much everybody is a pedophile that's trying to control the world. so bill gates definitely is a pedophile. everybody in power, anybody in power, there's a kind of a deep skepticism about power and a conspiratorial way to see the world where everything is dark forces in all corners. it's the way you feel when you're a kid that there's a monster hiding in the closet. which is also why you leap over the bed from four feet away. there's a strategy. yes. so, but he says that you're just being weak. you need to look under the bed. under the bed, there's monsters and we need to be aware of them because they're growing. they're multiplying. you should be- and they're touching children. they're touching children, exactly. so it all connects. but the, i, when i listened to him and i thought about , do i wanna talk to him on this podcast, for example? when i listened to his conversation with joe rogan, the two times he talked on there, to me it was somehow entertaining. like it was fun to listen to. it's fun to listen to a madman go on for four hours because it's almost theater. like this is what i talked to joe about. when people try to censor alex jones, joe says that the people who try to censor him don't give enough credit to the intelligence of human beings to understand. like that, what a person says on a large platform does not necessarily, is not the truth. you can be a madman and say crazy things and people are intelligent enough to hear certain things when they're said, the earth is flat. they can be intelligent enough not to all of a sudden start believing that the earth is flat. like they're intelligent enough to sort of select different ideas and be able to enjoy the theater of a particular ridiculous over the top conversation without being sort of influenced the way they start believing toxic set of beliefs. now there's a lot of sort of other kinds of people, especially now with cancer culture that say, well, you don't wanna give platform to crazy people that ultimately whose beliefs might lead to dangerous consequences. like, and i see it very often now with conspiracy theories that go way too far. like for example, i haven't looked into it, so i'm sorry. i will look into it, but it hurts my heart to see that on bill gates, in my opinion, the person who has saved and improved more lives than probably any human in history, literally because of the money he's invested in helping just the work he's done on malaria in africa, the number of people he's helped is huge. and yet every interview, anything you see now on bill gates, everyone is calling him, i believe, haven't looked into it, but i believe everyone's calling him a pedophile, i don't know the full structure of it, but it's just a very, it feels an army of , it feels it's hundreds of thousands of people. that's what it feels . it might be a much smaller percentage, but it feels a huge number of people are calling him a pedophile. so that's the flip side. if you allow, if you give platform to conspiracy theories that, then you start to have bigger and bigger percent of the population believe in these crazy things. i just, i wanted to put it out there because i don't know what to think of that. if you put yourself in joe rogan's shoes, if you put yourself in my shoes, if you put yourself just in your own shoes, i mean, i'm in my shoes right now. great, if you're staying in your shoes, just stay in your shoes. can i have your word? would you talk, would you give platform to people alex jones? would you talk to somebody alex jones or not? yes, i would. and i feel very strongly about this, honestly. well, i think that it's an interesting thing. and i would just say a lot of times i can understand, very, very clearly why people would take issue with the idea of, i guess what they proceed to be amplifying this man's voice, this man's reach as a demonstrable negative. but i think when you take a step back further, the cure is more damaging than the disease and significantly so. i guess, i think that i'm very, very wary of, i think being wary, you mentioned alex jones being wary of power and people with it. that's a lot of times there's a lot of truth and validity to crazy things that people say. the conspiracy theories that stick are the ones that sound credible, at least quasi credible in some aspect. and it's almost it seems to me an anchor in people's mind. and it is also funny to me, obviously, the bill gates, it's funny to tar people with things pedophile, racist, rapist. like these are things that we're basically trying to pick words that no one can ever support someone who does these things. and that's, you know. and that changes year by year. currently, pedophile is totally in as a thing to call somebody just as a, it used to be communist or marxist. cleveland browns fan, you know, come on. you know, who would want that? actually, nobody likes the browns. so i'll agree with you. that's why i picked them. that's the trick is you find a group of people that nobody likes. we're good here? all right, that's the move. but yeah, that's a creepy thing though, because that is the creepy thing. it's people are always looking for, groups of people are always looking for, and i find this really deeply disturbing. like, hey, so who's the guy that we can all get away with, you know, just treating dirt? who's the guy that i can be a dick to? i can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's gonna say anything. and it's even if, you know, people do that with, whether it's literal nazis or someone that i called a nazi, you know, i guess what's the bigger issue? this person's ridiculous beliefs or what i'm doing? and you mentioned hitler before, and obviously mein kampf being the outline for some of the things he did later and when the evil was it always there? did it take root later on or flourish later on? but was adolf hitler a problem because he had crazy ideas or because he did things? i think it's because it's not, i think. i know it's because he did things. now, if i'm gonna start punishing thought crime, i'm gonna have to start punishing thought crime. and that's a terrifying concept. even if i'm right about the certain, about the objectively correct about the things that i decide to call out of bounds, who put me in charge and made me arbiter of good taste? and how long until i decide that something else is out of bounds? it's always a sliding scale or it's always a sliding standard. and i find that, you know, to be more of a concern than people doing crazy things, because i guess if you mentioned alex jones, you know, putting out ridiculous ideas, ridiculous theories, i think that most people don't look at alex jones as a credible person. now, i'm not gonna pretend to be deeply read into all of his beliefs or the things that he's trying to peddle. but there's plenty of things that are quasi mainstream that i think on this side or that side that maybe not comparably ridiculous, but are, you know, particularly in hindsight or, you know, are silly. and i guess the idea of getting a group of people together to decide what we're not going to tolerate is a very, very tricky thing. and i think that, you know, it reminds me of law or, you know, even, you know, religion when it gets to, , what are the things that we don't ? how do we feel about rape? it's , no, under no circumstances is that an acceptable behavior. murder, no, that's not acceptable behavior. killing, i don't know, kind of depends on the situation. are you at war? were you justified? were you acting in self-defense? okay, so it's not, now, murder is a specific type of killing. the same way, you know, other things should be a specific type of something else, but i guess we draw the line of murder. we say, if you want to exist in our society, you can't do this. this cannot be done. and then we go, theft. if someone said, hey, i murdered that guy, can you understand where i'm coming from? i might say, yeah, i'll hear you out. doesn't mean that i think you're right, but i'm , have you ever been wronged so deeply that you could imagine that you could kill someone? i'm , no, i haven't. but i could conceptualize someone doing that, and i'm , yeah, okay, and you still need to go, you still need to face, you know, criminal justice as we have it in our system, or at least that's how we've decided. yeah, it's interesting. you have to be able to, , there's, if you look at the history of discourse in this country, i think it's still true, but i'm not sure it's changed since 9-11, is it used to be impossible to criticize a soldier. it was easier to criticize war. it was harder to criticize soldiers for allowing themselves to be the tools of war. i tend to be, maybe it's the russian upbringing, it's the combat thing. i tend to romanticize war and soldiers. i see soldiers as heroes, but i've also heard people that not only say that soldiers are, war is bad, they say soldiers are bad. what's their argument? it's the kind of a libertarian view that they're basically slaves to evil, right? war is evil, and they're given, they are suspending their moral and ethical duties as a human being to become the tools of evil. that's sort of the argument, if you see war as evil. i mean, i think it's useful to hear that, but there's for a long part in history that was completely unacceptable. same with abortion. you see abortion as murder. i mean, if i put it in that basket. it starts, we're living in the midst of a genocide. looked at from that perspective, could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion? you go, of course. looked at from a different perspective, you say, i don't believe it to be murder. that's not how i see it. then you go, well, if that's the genesis of your thought process, then you're , yeah, okay, now i see how we can come to a different thing, but i guess we go, well, abortion is murder, period. therefore, if you support it, you support murder. that's a convenient way for me to tar you, right? but i guess that's kind of coming back to the alex jones. i'm- it's the nuance. you have to have the nuance in these kinds of conversations. and i have to be willing to have the conversation, and i have to be willing to sit down. if i can't sit down across from the most violently racist, angry, hypothetical internet conceived person that none of us have ever actually met in real life, but are hopefully not, and go , well, of course i believe that this person's wrong, but allow me to change, do my best. i'll hear them out and i'll go, no, i can go point by point and explain where this guy or this girl is wrong, and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position where they will have better beliefs, and they will objectively better beliefs, and beliefs that will, and they'll treat other people better. why would i wanna marginalize this person? now, i might not wanna talk, i might not wanna invite them to my barbecue if they're acting a jerk all the time, but how could i, would it not make the world a better place if i'd hear them out and they go, look, if you're gonna sit down and talk with me, we're gonna have to have a discussion. i'll hear what you have to say, and if i can't explain to someone why their ridiculous belief is wrong, then i must not be so confident in my position, and i guess that's where i come back to the alex jones thing. as you mentioned, with bill gates, and you're much more familiar with the specifics of all the good that he's done, but again, he's been an unbelievable force for good in this world. you can list a, b, c, d, things that the man has done, that his foundation has done, and positive things, and then the other people could speculate about ridiculous, crazy levels of evil, but you can't produce any evidence for that sort of thing, because if you could, the man will find himself in some trouble. and anyway, i guess what i would say is that, you can't force me to accept the truth the same way you could write down two plus two equals four on a piece of paper and show me how it works, and i could say, nah, uh-uh, but that doesn't make it not true, and you've still given yourself an opportunity to present your case, you've presented it to me, and you've also, for anyone listening and watching, you've been able to critically assess what's gone on, or critically address back and forth the discourse, and i think that you're making your case for the public, so i guess when it comes to just not engaging with these people, that seems to me to be cowardly, and i think that that's something that we're seeing in society right now. i think we're seeing a crisis of courage in society all over the place, and i think that's where we're seeing poor leadership, i think we're seeing understandable things happening everywhere, but we need stronger voices and stronger beliefs that have a conviction and are willing to engage with others, not just turning into a shouting contest, and not, i didn't win because there's more of me, , i voted you, that's nice too, but that's a stand-in for bullets, that's saying i won because there's more of me, that doesn't mean that i'm right, because plenty of horrible and unpopular now things have been very, very deeply popular in the past and would have won a popular vote, does that make them right? i'd say clearly not, so i guess you'd hope that we engage with these people and that you can do your best to bring them over to a more reasonable position if you believe that you have one, and if you can't, well, at least you made the effort, and i think that that's something where martial arts shows the value, it's , do you know if you're gonna go win your next fight? i'm , i have no idea, i will proceed forward with full effort, and i will fight with dignity, i'll fight with honor, and i'll fight with courage, and i'll use everything that i have, and i will play within the bounds of the game, and that's that, and the result will be what it'll be, but i will walk into and out of that ring with my head held high, because i will know that i did my part, i did my job, the outcome, the specific outcome is not in my control, it's just strongly in my influence, and i think that that's something that helped me, that martial arts has taught me, because other times, even when i was successful or unsuccessful, i would focus on, if i won, i won, therefore i'm good, i lost, therefore i'm bad, this other guy won or lost, therefore, as opposed to evaluating their method, and i think it's so easy when we're taking a bird's eye view of things, to not evaluate how someone's doing things, you're not evaluating my process, you're simply evaluating my outcome, and i could have stumbled into something very, very good or very, very bad, and we can look back, and i think that's the value of history, i mean, i don't mean to get on my dang high horse, but it's this, evaluate history, is we can see the unbroken chain, or the chain of events that led us somewhere, and then only with the eyes of history can we truly evaluate things, unless we're in the room watching it happen, and i guess, that's again where we start to go, most of the big, bad, scary things that have happened in history that are done, particularly on an industrial scale, which implies governmental power and things that, or the equivalent, involve groups of people getting together and going, hey, we're not gonna deal with that guy, giant groups of people, so maybe we're right this time, but maybe we're wrong next time, and i guess i would be back to the gandalf putting on the one ring, i would be very, very hesitant, even if we thought we were in the right, to simply try to marginalize just on general principle, even people alex jones, who on their face are pretty ridiculous, you said, you should sit down with adolf hitler and talk to the men. i agree with you, to play a little devil's advocate, please. is alex jones might be a bad example, but if we look at, because he has a face, he is a human, he's a real person, there's also trolls on the internet, 4chan, the worry i have with those folks is that, and there might be parallels to martial arts, is they practice guerrilla warfare, meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive at the truth, they just always want to cut at the ankles of the powerful, they want to always break down the powerful, and even if they turn everything into a game, so they, let's see if we can make the world, let's see if we can make a trend that bill gates is a pedophile, right? they make it into a game, they get excited about this game, they see the powerful, let's see if we can convince that, who is the most positive person we can think of, let's see if we can turn them into evil, and they've tried that with everybody, and it seems to stick, and they're good at it, and some would argue, or whatever you think about our current president, that he has some elements of that, which is he's figured out whatever this music of social discourse that's going on, he's figured out how to always troll the mainstream flow of consciousness, that's the media, he always kind of says stuff that annoys a very large number of people, and he enjoys that, because it's taking the powerful, taking the way things were before, and he shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing, almost on purpose or instinctually and so on, the problem i have with that is that doesn't, the powerful thing there is it brings the power, those in power down a notch, that's a great thing, the negative thing is it doesn't push us closer to a nuanced, careful, rigorous discourse towards truth, it's showing up to a party and just starting to yell, it doesn't create a good conversation, it just makes everything into a game where truth doesn't even seem a thing we can even hope to achieve. i mean that makes sense, and i guess as you mentioned, they'll come back to another movie, because i don't do books and do movies, some people just wanna watch the world burn, right, and i guess that's a creepy, creepy kind of urge that some people have, and also is some people you're , hey, would you to throw a brick through that glass window? you're , yeah, sure, no, i'm not gonna do that, because i think about what's going to occur, something's gonna be hurt, someone's property, not gonna do it versus, hey, you wanna see what'll happen? like yeah, sure, kids are always , i have my son, he just grabs spider-man and drops him on the table, spider-man fell, spider-man didn't fall, sean, you dropped him, you knocked him off the table, and he'll grin, and basically, it's an interesting thing, you said, playing that these people are appealing to, and also almost the little dog factor of people do wanna watch the powerful get taken down a notch for all the good and the not good of that, just plenty of people, it seems to me that have found their way to incredibly high positions, some have just found themselves there, and many, many, many, many, many people, men and women of all backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard, and yeah, of course there's luck, and there's luck into everything, there's lebron james, in spite of being the best basketball player on god's green earth, is fortunate that he didn't get hit by a car, it's fortunate that he didn't tear his knee, but thankfully, we get to see all these things, but i guess it's, if people don't have any skin in the game, you never know what they're gonna do, and i think that's the problem with the internet, that people get to be nameless, be faceless, that's why guerrilla fighters are outside of the bounds of war, you don't have a uniform on, i don't know who you're from, you don't get the same treatment that a soldier gets, for, and people go, well, that's crazy, and actually there's reasons for this, because otherwise people are able to assail things, and there's no one responsible, there's no way to go and say, hey, where did this come from, what's the root of this, how can i address this, and i think that's the problem of the internet, it's the problem of twitter, it's the problem of places 4chan, i wouldn't mind seeing that type of stuff go away, if i'm frank, but that's not the same thing as people with a face, people who are willing to stand there and say, hi, my name is so-and-so, even if i have ridiculous beliefs, hopefully people will hear me out, and then if i'm wrong, educate me, but i guess you hope that the real, i guess in my mind antidote to all of this silliness is education, and i think that that's something that critical thinking is not necessarily, i went to school in america, and i feel very fortunate, but critical thinking is not something that's focused on, i mean, and it's tough, it's almost talking about jujitsu, it's tough to teach critical thinking when i don't know any words, you have to teach me techniques, you can't teach me to be an artist, but recognize that the techniques are the beginning, not the end, ultimately it's the artistry that we are searching for, not just the science or the by-rote memorization, and i guess you'd hope that people's ability to think critically and recognize that majority rule or whoever's loudest does not mean that they're right by any stretch of the imagination, and we don't appeal to that, and we don't bow to that, will help them to, help inoculate them against the ridiculous things that come out of these places, these dark places that are objectively not great, but i guess all circling back, even if we swatted these bad things out of existence right now, we've got to be very, very careful doing that, because it's who's doing the swatting, this political group that's in power right now, the people that support our current president would maybe feel a certain way, the people that support another option would feel differently as to what exactly defines toxic, and i guess that's what gives me pause. yeah, but also the grace thing, i tend to believe that the technology, you said education, but the platforms we use twitter and the reddit and all these platforms have a role to play to teach us grace, meaning they should help us incentivize the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real life. like being a dick in real life is not incentivized, one-on-one interaction. there's cases where it is, but usually being kind to each other is incentivized. on the internet, it's not. like you get likes for mocking people in a funny, in a humorous way, and it can be dark kind of mocking, depending on the community. you can go to the appearance. if somebody's a little fat or a little too skinny, you can comment on their appearance, the hair, the way their hair looks, the appearance stuff. it could be on the people comment all the time on the level of eloquence of my speech. go fuck yourself. i it. it's creepy though watching previously, this used to be lowbrow though, people doing this type of stuff. it's creepy watching our political figures get into this type of game. yes, but again, it's a little bit refreshing, right? my hope with donald trump was, is that he would shake up the people who wear suits usually. the, if you're from dc, i remember showing up. i actually didn't wear what i usually wear in dc, cause i was , everybody's wearing a suit and tie when i was giving talks and stuff. except for mudge who wears jeans and a t-shirt. mudge doesn't give a damn. he said. mudge is a forever renegade. but i don't even remember what, yeah. so my hope with trump was the huge shake up that system to say , to inject new ideas, to inject new energy. of course, the way it turned out is different, but there's, it turns out that you might wanna have somebody who's an andrew yang type character, who is full of ideas that are very different and inject the energy, new energy into the system through youthful new ideas versus through the troll that , that's very good at sort of mocking and playing outside the rules of the game. but trump did reveal powerfully, i don't know what to think of it, that it's just a game and you don't have to play by the rules. that's both inspiring and dark. deeply depressing, right? yeah, and i don't know what to do with it. i don't, i mean the same, i'm not drawing parallels, not drawing parallels between our president and adolf hitler, but it's certainly, and there's a lot of, in history, a lot of positive and a lot of negative things happen when charismatic leaders realize they don't have to play by the rules. you can just flip the table. what's that kevin spacey show? oh, house of cards. house of cards, where you just flip the table or whatever. you don't have to play by the rules of the chess game. you can flip the table. one wonders if that's always been done in private, you know? i guess, cause that's, i mean, even look, obviously, in the united states as a republic, but we had bush, then we had clinton, then we had more bush, then we had president obama, then we were about to have another clinton. that's fairly creepy. yeah. even on its own. but now we added another, i mean, i'm sure we'll have a generation of trumps now. gee. we, you know, i'm russian, so i think we humans kings still and queens. there's something we're attracted to. the thing we talked about, coaches, there's something in us that longs towards that authoritarian control. one of the beautiful things about america, the second amendment is we also individual freedom. that's one of the unique aspects at the founding of this country and still, and for me is the beacon of hope that somehow there's the fire of freedom burns in that texas feel that gives me hope. the fu energy that revolts against the power, which as we discussed, power corrupts and ultimately leads to sort of degradation of the whoever's ruling the people. it's interesting though. it seems to me, maybe i'm just, i don't know if i'm reading this properly when i see it, but it seems to me that, you said, that flip the bird, i'm gonna do me within reason. like as long as i'm not hurting you, is idea that very much, at least in my mind, defines the american ideal or at least part of the consciousness of the united states is under attack to a certain extent. if only i can think to , maybe generation behind us, it's becoming more collectivist for all the good and also the not good of that. and it's not in terms of policy at this point, but just in terms of the consciousness. and i wonder if that's an internet thing. people are more in touch with one another than they've, as far as i can tell, that we've ever been or at least more than in my lifetime. and the rest of the world seems much closer than it did. living in virginia, california seems very far away. being on the internet, it's just right there. i can hear about it, i can see it. i can interact with people from there. i remember being in tennessee at one time and then reading about events taking place in the middle east. and that just seemed a mile away. it seemed a unbelievably far distance. and then another time when you're in dc, you just feel , , you read about something happening in paris and it just feels it's just right around the corner because dc is a seat of power where things are just occurring all the time. and i guess you wonder about, that's where i come back to the group decisions to not listen to this person or to cancel this or to, we all, the moral majority shall do the following as opposed to as long as you're not hurting me and long as you're not hurting anyone else, i have to let you do, i have to let you be on general principle. even if i don't you, i'm very free to not you. i'm free to speak out against you, but i'm not, it is not within my right or, and not with it. and it's not, i would not be right to attempt to attack you. and that is an interesting thing though, when we see words being redefined or words being defined, whether it's toxicity, whether it's violence, if i think that what you're saying is, your speech is by itself, a violence or a precursor to violence, i'm justified in doing all sorts of things. and that creeps me out significantly because again, even if it ends up being pointed in a good direction, initially, it's only a matter of time. and actually that brings me to another- dune quote? oh yeah, i got all day. how much are they paying you? but we have about say the frank herbert estate, not enough frankly. let's see. and how many books are there in dune? that's a jen question. you're also a fan of jen. i read the whole series, but not a couple of the, i read all the prequels as well, with the exception of a couple. is there a book one for dune? dune, it would be book one and even the prequels, it's still all better if you start. like i read dune and then read the original, what is it, six? and then i went back and started to read some of the- it's just watching star wars. you wanna start at episode four or whatever? yeah, i think so. that's the move and then stop at six, call it a day, watch the mandalorian. well, i thought you're not walking back here. no, i liked the mandalorian. yeah, it's not that- that is what i said. i was told that i was heartless for not liking baby yoda, who i- we don't talk about a couple of the movies, not including the mandalorian, the mandalorian's fine. it's the more recent movies that we don't to talk about. oh, the, what's his name? the goofy guy. ryan- no, no. no, the creature, the goofy creature with the- jar jar? yeah, jar jar. did you ever see the jar jar binks is actually the dark lord of the sith theory that fixed the whole initial trilogy? where he's goofing around and making it all the way through battles and when you're , wait a minute, he oops his way, walks over to a pool, does a triple back flip, falls in. you're , it's just bizarre that you- this is the alex jones theory of star wars. this is he's actually running everything. he was the one that actually was , hey, we should vote in chancellor palpatine or senator palpatine right before. they put jar jar in charge. first off, what did they think was gonna happen? and second off, that was, i would just think that'd be great. you're , oops, man, i guess he's the emperor now. that would have been great. but actually to the cancel and all the other stuff again, it's just, you'd hope that it gives pause. and i think about this for fighting because a lot of times, i'll use this as an example, people fight fans and ufc, they love people that run out and try to murder each other. and it's entertaining and it's super entertaining. but floyd mayweather doesn't resonate with people as much. it's people started, i remember the time when floyd was not as popular. now people think people love floyd because he's 50 and 0 floyd. and man, and finally he had so much success that we all can't help but recognize the man's genius and greatness. but prior to that, , he's boring, he's this, he's that. he fights with, he's circumspect, he's cautious, he's pressing, he's intelligent, deeply intelligent. and when you watch people go out and try to murder each other, you can flip a coin a hundred times and you can be lucky enough to get a hundred heads, but it's still a coin flip. and i think that that's what's going on all the time is people are getting an outcome that they want, but it wasn't a well-thought out situation. and that's why you'll win by five in a row by knockout and then lose three in a row. and then people will go, well, what happened to that guy? he used to be so great. and you're , no, he's doing what he's always been doing. it's just, it was getting great outcomes on a coin flip prior, and it's getting negative outcomes on a coin flip now. but i guess what i would say is it's interesting watching, i guess, societal beliefs become such a thing that we're almost adopting on a religious level if we're not careful. if when i say religious level, i mean pan life, this is guiding all of my choices for all the good and the bad of that. and this is a dune quote is, when religion and politics travel in the same car, the writers believe that nothing can stand in their way. their movements become headlong faster and faster and faster. they put aside all thoughts of obstacles and forget that the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush until it's too late. and i think that that's again, the pause we go, man, thank goodness we have this guy that wants to rebuild germany. he'll put us back where we need to be. and you stop questioning your own judgment, your own, just you start, you stop thinking essentially. right, i'm not allowed to question this. oh, well, of course this is correct. of course this is correct. of course i'm right. i intended to do right. so of course my actions are correct. i mean, how many times have any of us intended to do something helpful and ended up doing something less? and plenty of people who intend to do harm could by accident do something decent. and i guess it's, i'm not saying anything terribly, terribly insightful, but it's just one of those where it's hard to say in the moment and that's where you hopefully caution, you would counsel some degree of caution. and that's what worries me with people deciding that we're all so right about this or we're all so right about that. and attempting to, rather than win the argument, silence the counter argument, no matter how crazy it may seem. because i just think that that idea, even when it's pointed in a good direction initially, it's only a matter of time. you're amongst many things, a jujitsu black belt. one of the things that people are really curious about, white belts and blue belts in jujitsu, but also people haven't tried the art, is what does it take to be a jujitsu black belt? i think that everyone's journey is a little bit different, but the one thing that the, what is it? calvin coolidge quote, determination, persistence is the only thing that will win in the end. it will always win in the end. not brilliance, not toughness, not education, it's persistence. and i think that having the belief that no matter what happens to me, i will proceed forward and i will figure out how to make this happen, hell or high water, i think is the one thing that ties together all of the people that i've ever met that made it through whatever it was that they were going through. because sometimes you can get lucky and you can have an easy time or, and that luck could be, you had a good situation, it could be, i mean, in the obvious sense of where you're living, where you're training, what's going on, you had a good situation, you're unbelievably athletic. oh, you're gonna be an astronaut, you're brilliant, and an olympic athlete, you know, , well, that's a fantastic situation. you know, you won the genetic lottery and you've worked hard as well, but you also won the genetic lottery. it's, determination is the one thing though, because that person could have a very easy go of it initially and then tear their knee. and then they're no longer the superhuman physical specimen that they were. the only thing that will keep them going is persistence. and i think that that, i would just say that persistence, i say, i'll just put one foot in front of the other. and sometimes i can see the path ahead. and sometimes it's beyond my vision, but i will not stop. i may even slow down, but i won't stop. and that's the only thing that i can say that i've seen tie everyone together, because there's so many ways to the top of any mountain. and there's so many different personalities and skills and backgrounds involved, but everyone carries on. so at the core, the foundational advice is just don't quit. just keep going. that's the lesson of martial arts, i think. you know, we think it's how to be strong or how to win, but in reality, it's how to persist, how to endure, because it's, all of us have been beaten so many times and gotten beaten up so many times and thought about quitting. have i ever thought about quitting? absolutely. have i ever quit? never, i will never, ever quit, ever. i can say that. i will be damned if i quit. what's the darkest moment? is it injury related? like is it, so to me, two possibilities. i've fortunately never been seriously injured, but i think that's a dark place to be, having to be out for many months for, as jen was saying, with a head injury especially, the uncertainty, that's one. and then the other side is if you have big ambitions as a competitor, realizing that you're not as good. like those doubts were , i kind of suck. how am i supposed to be a world, the greatest fighter of all time if several people in the gym are kicking my ass? those are the two things that paralyze you. i think that everyone's darkest moment is maybe different. looking from the outside for ryan, i wouldn't say that he's had injuries and he's had bad ones. i wouldn't say that was his darkest moment. i think for me, i would say some of my head injury was my darkest moment. absolutely, and i've torn my acl twice. i've torn my shoulders four times. i've had lots of surgeries. for me, the orthopedic injuries were not the most difficult, it was the brain injury. for others, that might be the case for them. maybe they've never experienced an injury and maybe for them, that's their darkest moment. from the outside, obviously ryan can speak to this more, but for ryan, i think it was the inability to perform at certain points, the missing of opportunities that for him, from my perspective, watching him go through and having seen various points of his growth from early purple belt on, i think the hardest time for him looking in, obviously, was when he would hit moments where he wasn't able to perform for various reasons. he couldn't get fights. he was having difficulties there. i think that was the hardest point for him. did you think with a head injury that you might never be able to do jiu-jitsu again? yeah, mine was really bad and it was just the one hit, but i had a looping memories for seven months. didn't know it because when your brain's messed up, you're not even aware that you're looping. that's great. and so i saw two different neurologists. i finally, it took a very long time. i didn't know if i was gonna be able to have linear thoughts or read a book. i didn't know at certain points if i could listen to music again without it making my head hurt. and so it was almost two years before i woke up in the morning without a headache, just waking up before i even start my day. and so that- so that's even bigger than jiu-jitsu. that's just life. that's just hard. and i think that you can experience so many things. i've had all these injuries. we lost a baby when i was 15 weeks. we've had all these experiences and what the hardest point for me, not saying all of those things weren't hard, but it's kind of , you go through these, you just realize life goes on and you have to keep working at it and you have to keep going. and you asked me earlier offline, did i feel depressed? and not for my head injury. i don't think that at least in the moment i had any recognition of that. it's kind of , but i think different people's personalities, i have kind of the buckle down and just keep going. and sometimes it's not until lots of time later that you realize, wow, that was really hard because you're just struggling to live and function and do the things that you need to do along the path. do you mind jumping on just this part of the conversation just for a few minutes? i'm sorry, i need to over. do you mind just sitting together? oh, no, no. just for a little bit. sorry about that. i didn't mean to jump in there. it'd be cool if we put a face to it. is it okay with you? yeah, it's fine with me. it's fine with you. by the way, what was the head injury, if you don't mind sharing? someone had dropped their knee on the back of my head during training. it was a lot bigger than me. so one strike to the back of the head is too much for someone. there's a reason that's outlawed in mma, right? someone 50 pounds heavier than you, drops their knee on the back of your head once. that's the funny thing about getting hit, right? you never can really be sure what's gonna happen. i think that's actually one of the magical parts about jiu-jitsu where , if you choke me, if you, we know what's gonna occur. you hit someone, they might be completely unharmed. like you might be punching tony ferguson in the face and you need to hit him with a sledgehammer to affect this man. and then other people, they could get really badly hurt, which i guess it's back to your point about, street fighting and things that and the serious, serious potential, second, third order consequences of any action that we take. but yeah, that's a tricky thing about getting hit. how does it make you feel that, the really shitty thing about injuries to me was that , you start thinking , well, if i didn't this one little thing different, this wouldn't have happened today. like one moment changes your entire life. is that, do you think that way or is that totally counterproductive? you can't help but think that way. when you've had the amount of injuries i've had, because i've had more than most people's fair share, as my orthopedic says, you don't wanna win that. you don't wanna win the contest of who's had the most. but since you have, that's building me a pool. yeah, but i think you can't help but think that way sometimes, but i definitely don't think it's, i think it can be facilitative if you don't beat yourself up too much. because thinking about why have i been subject to so many injuries and a lot of it comes to just, almost all of mine in particular, people a lot heavier than me. but if i've been training martial arts 15 years, i'm obviously on the much smaller side, i'm a woman. i've done thousands and thousands of rounds with people, 50 pounds plus heavier than me. i've been years not training with anyone less than 50 pounds, which is 50 pounds is almost half my body weight. and when you also add testosterone, the natural physiological advantages of men, not just are they heavier with more mass, they're faster, they're more explosive, they're stronger, if they're the same size. and so i think that the willingness to be in that environment over and over and over again, creates a lot of strength, resiliency, willingness to continue. but it also, in order to do that, you almost have to, for me, the way i was approaching, it was pretend i wasn't more vulnerable and just be willing to step in and step in and step in. fake it until you make it kind of thing? fake it until you make it kind of, yeah, i'll just one day i'll be strong enough. and you avoided injury for most of it. for most of those rounds i would injury. the problem as ryan points out is that, you could do thousands of rounds, but if one person that size, that strength, that hover reacts in a way that you don't expect, it doesn't, it's not an oops, it's always major. do you regret any of it? i think that most, no one i know has experienced the degree of injuries that i've experienced. and i started at a time when, in 2005 it was very different than now, where you have, the coaches have more control over what you're doing, they're more aware in general about a lot of the injuries. there's a lot more people who are hobbyist than when i started. they were hobbyist, but it was different kind of hobbyist than now. now our girls can train with other girls. they don't have to do thousands of rounds with somebody significantly more powerful than them. for the drawbacks and the benefits of that, as with anything. so i think that, i don't think i would go back and change it. there were times after one of my injuries where i said to ryan, i said, i quit, i'm done. i'm not doing this anymore. i probably said it more than once, but there was one time i was really serious. in 2012, i was really serious. i had torn my shoulder. i was looking at missing a big competition again in the world for my second or third year in a row after injuries. and i said, i'd quit my job two years before and i'm , i'm done. and ryan, before that had always been, you know, keep your focus. and then he kind of said, okay, if you want to be done, be done. just have a good time. no, i'm really done. i don't even want to train anymore. okay, okay. and then, you know, i think he helped facilitate a moment for me to go visit some friends, some girls that were doing a girls camp who were close to my size or some friends of mine to go train. and i was , wait, i do love this thing. it's just harder for me on a daily basis, but that doesn't mean i don't love this thing. and it really helped change my mind. i started to connect with some other people, travel more myself. because previously he had done that, but i hadn't really done that. i think there was a point where, when i started jiu jitsu, it was just for fun. i just wanted to sport after college. i played sports as a kid. i just wanted to exercise. i wasn't into the martial arts. he used to give me a hard time about it because he was always very, how can you not care about martial arts? i don't know, i just want to play sports. and ryan was really big into kind of the philosophy side of the martial arts aspect. he used to give me a hard time. and i think after that moment, this moment where i looked at myself and i said, joe, i want to keep doing this, is when i started to appreciate jiu jitsu. it took off some of the pressure i'd been feeling, i think, as ryan's girlfriend, but i had a full-time job a long time. it was never my goal to be a jiu jitsu world champion. and i think after that moment where i was , i really do this. i really do want to keep this. i had this moment, any time where you're , i'm doing this for me, i'm not doing this for him. and i think that that's, i think that that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives do we have a kind of a challenge where we have to stop and we have to say, is this really what i want? how often in a relationship do you do that? how often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop? and do you really ask yourself, is something really difficult happen that you look and you go, am i just doing this because it's convenient and easy, or is this what i really want to do? yeah, i've had those moments. like this podcast is one of those things, is you stop and think , i actually love this. and it's, i had that with you just too. i don't think i had sat until brown belt that i stop. i mean, yeah, it's when you first face real challenges, you think , why am i doing this? i think most of my progression was why not? i think that's the right, the leap of faith. and then at a certain point you think , why am i doing this? and if you can answer honestly that because i love it, it's kind of a liberating feeling. it's a, yeah, it's so powerful. it's an acceptance. you feel thankful for the opportunity to be there, right? because you love it and you go, man, i- yeah, it's great gratitude. yeah, it's ultimately gratitude, yeah. let me ask you this. so ryan said , what is it? i took over your thing. yeah, nobody cares about ryan. i wouldn't. i'll photoshop him out or whatever. however you edit. if you could do that, it'd be great. put sean connery's head. yeah, just a dune ad over here. exactly. sean connery, i could get down on that. is that the sexiest man in sean connery? in the dune universe, that's my understanding. i think in any universe. yeah, well, mine doesn't give a- we actually named our son after sean connery. oh yeah. sorry. 35 nos in a yesh, we did. he was in the rock. that was, i love all those lame- nicholas cage. oh yeah. connery was probably the greatest movie of all time. there's his accent and connery was so awesome. i don't know where it's from. alabama, i guess, or something. i love that they got steve buscemi in there. we need steve buscemi in this thing. we got him. dave chappelle. yeah, that's right. yeah. he's a prisoner in the eight ball. yeah, that's right. yep, greatest movie of all time. should have won an oscar. dave chappelle also in blue street with martin lawrence. and in, what do you call it? robin hood men in tights. oh, robin hood men in tights was one of my favorites as a kid. that was a big, but yeah, that's a good, wow, we just listed off some really bad 90s movies. but- you take that back. for telling our age. yeah, that's all right. speak for yourself. so what, in your view, i don't mean to, from a smaller person, i guess, that's an interesting thing. well, jiu-jitsu is , that small, i don't, hopefully that's not a bad thing. elf. elves are taller. yeah. like with all these bigger people, you can still enjoy the art. what does it take to get a black belt to excel, to quote unquote, master the art? gosh, everyone has such a different path. ryan's promoted six, seven people. something that. and i think about half of them have had, have kids, have families, have other careers. at the time, some of them competed a lot. some of them have never competed or rarely competed. some haven't competed in a long time. some had started different places. everyone's had different journeys, even in our own little group of seven. i think only, maybe only two or three were high level competitors of that group. at the higher belts, very brown, black, maybe. and so, it's just different for every person. and that's something that we try to tell our, since we have 400 students, and do we have, we don't really have anyone who's, you know, a stated, other than other coaches, adam, but we don't have anyone that's a stated high level competitor as a student at the moment. people look at our gym and go, , it's lots of competitors. it's not lots of competitors. it's never been lots of competitors. and we've had ones and twos here and there. but really everybody's in it for the long term, if they're in it. sometimes the high level competitors are the ones that are more likely to drop off because they have a bit of success, particularly at blue or purple. and then they realize how hard it is at brown and black. and then they have a hard time continuing on that path. and then they can't look at themselves as a non-competitive, a hard time continuing with jiu-jitsu, i think. whereas sometimes it's the guy who comes in as the white belt and he trains, you know, twice a week, every week. and the next thing you know, he's been there for two or three years, , , he's a blue belt, he's a purple belt, he's a brown belt. and he's just consistent over a long period of time and willing to take the path. and no two people's path is exactly the same. no two people's lives are exactly the same. you have, we have students who started as a white belt as a young adult with no responsibilities. and they train all the time. and then they have a job, you know, then they graduate college, then they have a job, then they have married, then they have kids, then they have different points in their careers. and at different points in your life, jiu-jitsu will be there, you know, for whatever way that you're willing to accept it. it's place, i think. that's actually kind of what, back to the initial question we discussed about, you know, what makes a warrior, you know, and also what makes something or someone, you know, particularly impressive in my mind, is what they make out of what they have. you know, one of my favorite movies ever is forrest gump. and it's obviously, it's just, if you can't, because i've heard people go, forrest gump sucks. i'm , i don't you as a person. and you have no heart at all. but basically, it's the story of someone that tries hard. and it's , yeah, but it's a funny movie. but it's , you know, i guess you meet each person where they are, you know? and obviously, you want, everyone needs to be pushed. we all need to be pushed. we need friends and people around us that push us to be better versions of ourselves all the time. and as you mentioned, the people you spend all of your time around deeply impact you. and we have to be willing to be pushed. it takes a leap of faith for me to trust, for me to put some of my self in, my, you know, i guess my ability, my control, my personal agency, as it were, in the hands of someone else that i trust and that i respect. but if i can do that, again, maybe i never become, you know, high level black belt competitor, but you know, i had four of the things i was doing in my life. i also have a family. i have this, i have that. you know, what that person was able to accomplish in the martial arts relative to what they were able to put in this phenomenal. you know, other times someone could be a very successful black belt, and in my mind, be a bum because they could have been a lot more. and you know, they could have done more. they could have focused more. and there's no shame in deciding that you don't want to do that. but whatever it is that you're invested in, i remember the, take it uneasy podcast. and that i loved because, you know, i'll just chill out. i resting. it's vacation. oh, who wants to go on vacation? yeah, i'll go on vacation for a day or two. you want to spend three weeks on vacation? like i kill myself. like, get me out of here. like, this is horrible. this is, i'm a waste of life. i'm not doing anything useful. i hate vacation. you're technically on vacation right now. right. well, this is fun though. yeah. you're on a one day vacation. oh yeah, exactly. but you know, if you had to, i'm sure you're thinking about jumping off of the building right now. but if you had to talk to me for, you know, three days, i'm sure you'd probably shove me off the building. i don't blame you. i would be dead. five hours in. but yeah, but you know what it is, it's you want to be pushing towards something. because otherwise what's the purpose of being here? you know, it's not just a college. it's doing something useful, building, growing as a person, helping others do the same, if that's within your power at any given time. but i think that's kind of the neat thing about martial arts is it can be many, many different things to many different people. you know, i finally, for instance, was able to get a college degree this year. that which, i mean, it's not a big deal for most people. but for me, it was a big deal because i was- you went back and finished. yeah. and i never envisioned ever going back. and- that's a hard step to go back and finish. that's a, it weighs heavy on you if you don't. it's interesting. yeah, i was just, i was more proud of that than most things i've ever done, if i'm honest. you know, and it was neat and i really enjoyed it. and it was the process of doing it. but, you know, are my academic credentials impressive? like not in the least. but for me, it's it was a big deal for me personally to take that step and to go back and do that. and i was proud of the direction. and cause it would have been easy. like, do i need to do it? like, no, i'm, you know, i'm business. i'll do okay. i'll try it. i'll keep fighting. but i was happy to take the time in between fights when i was, when i was unbooked for an opponent to do something productive rather than just, i'll just hang out. you know, i can still train every single day, but i can also train and go to school. people go to the olympics while going to school. i can, i can do martial arts and go to school. one thing i gotta ask is, you know, a bunch of women listen to this podcast. if they haven't done jiu jitsu, i think it'd be kind of intimidating to step on the mat with a bunch of bros that enjoy somehow killing each other. like, how do you succeed in that environment to where you can learn this art, learn how to beat all those people up? gosh. is there any advice? i mean, another way to ask that is , if any women listening to this are interested in starting jiu jitsu, , is there advice for that journey? honestly, i think it's just walking in the door and starting. sometimes i don't know how to respond to that because i'm not, i don't view myself as typically anxious, particularly in interactions with other people or new people. you're just sleeping. shy is not a word that has been used for me by, if you ask my family, and they joke because our son talks a lot. he's advanced verbally and they're always , , well, let's, we know where he gets that from. like, he just doesn't stop talking. he narrates everything he does. and so they always tease because that's, , i'm known for kind of talking a lot. but, so i haven't been typically, i don't consider myself a shy person. so for me going into a new room, a new group of people is, you know, there's always a, you don't really know who they are, how they're gonna treat you. but i don't have a lot of anxiety with that. so i don't, if that's something that's gonna put something up, i don't really know how to address that particular feeling. but in terms of all of the rooms i've been in, i have popped into jiu jitsu gyms before i knew ryan in florida. like, i traveled for my job, so in germany and florida and california and places where i don't know anyone, they don't know me. and i have never once had anyone be anything other than kind and solicitous and helpful. and long before when i was a white belt and a blue belt and didn't know anything and didn't know anyone. and i just think that it's a community of people that it's so cool that no matter where you go in the world, i walked into a gym in prague one time where only two people spoke english. and it was just... yeah, it's weird. it's weird. it's weird that ... instantly you're part of a group and they're , , let me tell you about a place to go. it's being part of a cult, right? yeah. but it's a positive cult. like it for sure. that's what we would say as cultists. yeah, that's true. yeah. that's true. i mean, we do need to murder everybody who practice keto. i mean, yeah. that's this cult deeply believes it. no, but there is a... like if you look at different kinds of games chess and so on, there's a skepticism. i mean, there's not a brotherhood, sisterhood feeling. with jiu-jitsu, it's you can roll into most places. even with judo, i can see the contrast. cause i've trained in judo places. it's more tribal. like you walk in and , who is this? like there's that kind of feeling. with jiu-jitsu, there's less so. there is a little bit with the competitors. there's always the competitors feeling each other out, usually the blue belts. but outside of that, in terms of if you don't get the, if you walk in with the vibes of just loving the art and just willing to have a good time, you're welcome. it's really cool. it's really fascinating. it's a really great thing. i think, and as a woman, i think you think you're walking into these rooms of these big, strong, tough guys. and if anything, i would say that they're almost much more solicitous when a woman comes in there and not they're just hitting on you all the time. it's just that you walk in and everyone is , cool. you wanna do this thing that i love. let me make sure you have a good experience and take care of you. and i think that's an experience that i hope people have when they come into our gym. and i've always felt when i walked into other gyms. and so we try our best to make that comfortable. and it can be a little uncomfortable because there are, when you walk into a male-dominated environment, there's conversations and topics. there's a different style of camaraderie and joking that a lot of men will do that maybe some women are more uncomfortable with. i grew up with four brothers. so i kind of maybe was a little more desensitized to that. and i worked for the department of defense for a while too. so before i- so you were with the government. yeah, so i did that for a while after college. i'm already skeptical. yeah. i left, i left. oh, you left. i'm not gonna ask you about ufos then because you're not gonna tell me the truth. no, they exist. yeah, no, you just freaked out a lot of people. okay. but yeah, by the way, where's your school? cause people always ask where- well, we're outside of washington dc in northern virginia in falls church. you always wanna pick , what's the best school if i travel to this place or if i wanna move to this place. so that's- well, i mean, obviously we're biased, but yeah, we're in the washington dc area. the best. okay, we just took a little break. now we're back. let me ask you one thing that a bunch of people are curious about. you're one of the innovators. first of all, you're one of the great innovators and philosophers and thinkers in jiu jitsu, right? but you're also one of the innovators in terms of leg locks and the 50-50 position. and just the fact that legs have something to do in jiu jitsu. the other popularizer innovator in the space is john donahue and his whole group of guys. do you have thoughts about their whole system of leg locks and their ideas about jiu jitsu and so on? sure. i guess, obviously, john and the students at henso who've been able to do fantastic things competitively in the past number of years, you mentioned innovators in that kind of section of jiu jitsu. i would love to bring up some guys dean lister, of course, masakazu imanari. in fact, a lot of what was going on in 90s japan, combat submission wrestling, there was some crazy gnarly stuff that it's on grainy vhs tape, but stuff that if people were doing now, they go, my god, that's brand new. there's, it's been, i think these are things that have been around for a while in various places. i first learned the 50-50 position, just the leg entanglement of it from brandon vera, actually at a seminar at lord irvin's martial arts, i think in 2005. he learned it from dean lister who used it to submit alexandre kakareko, really, really tough nogi guy at adcc in the run that dean made to the gold medal in the absolute division, which was a great performance at the time, first american to do that. and i actually saw a video, i mean, first of all, boss rutten actually broke, i think, guy mezger's foot with a 50-50 heel hook, did he actually grab his heel and his toes? and in pancreases back when they had the man panties and the high boots on, and dude, that was gnarly. boss rutten is underappreciated as - he double grabbed - oh yeah, , you know, his leverage is leverage. that's a toehold that goes the other way. it's it either doesn't work or breaks in half. well, he's, people don't often think of boss rutten as an innovator, but he is in a way. like, he, you know, talk about elon musk and first principles thinking in terms of physics. he just feels he just gets the job. he figures out the simplest way to get the job done of breaking things and establishing control and hurting people. remember that was back in the day, if you listen to boss rutten do any commentary for any of the big mma shows or any mma show way back when, anytime guys were clenched, he's , the guy should roll for a knee bar. he was saying that way back when, and now people are doing it all the time with varying degrees of success. it's funny, it's , it's also tough to be, i think a breakaway thinker. i mean, you know, group think is a real thing in group inertia. and it's neat to see, you know, particularly at a time when maybe that type of stuff was less accepted, you know, someone going, hey, i'm gonna run off in this other direction. i think, you know, whoever, you know, the inventor of electricity in my mind is a lot more impressive than whomever, not to say that the person down the line isn't impressive, that comes up with an interesting way to use it. both are cool, but when you think about just, can you imagine we're sitting here and , yeah, people, i'm gonna build an airplane. you're , what are you talking about? it's crazy. people don't fly. i'm , no, i'm gonna do it. and of course, that's not gonna be as good as the airplane down the line, the iterative things that happen later on. but just being able to go to dream something into existence that you haven't seen before and then make it happen, takes an unbelievable, strength of character, almost a force of will, because you have, you're blazing a trail that hasn't been walked before. that's the bj penn factor in, you know, winning the jiu-jitsu world championship, first non-brazilian to do that. that was back in 2001. and then rafael lovato later on, it's , he's, you know, both of those guys are so unbelievably impressive in my mind for the same reason, you know, because they were out there winning at a time when that wasn't a common thing. not that it's easy to win now, it's just, there's not a psychological hurdle that needs to be leapt. i remember, you know, when i was early in jiu-jitsu, americans weren't winning the world championships at any belt. i mean, bj, we all knew bj penn because bj penn did it, but it was really, really uncommon. now it happens, you know, on a semi-regular basis. of course, the brazilians are still strong, europeans are still strong, but, and australians are coming on as well. but it's definitely kind of an interesting thing. so to come back to, you know, john danaher and the hensler team, obviously they're doing fantastic things. john's had some really, really great innovation there. and the systematization and the methodology that they're using is great. and it's neat to see that it's getting out there. i would just also, i would encourage people to make sure that they're, you know, catching up on their history. because obviously, you know, john's a brilliant instructor and has done things, you know, for the sport that are fantastic, that haven't been done before. but, you know, none of us exist in a vacuum and i've learned things from everywhere else. so, you know, john would say the same, i'm sure. and, you know, dean lister would say the same. and it's just neat when you can kind of trace the history of all of this happening, because we've had, humanity's had two arms and two legs for some time, at least as long as i've been alive. but you mentioned airplanes. do you think there's something totally new to be invented in jiu jitsu still? not totally new, but the, you know, flying isn't new, but airplanes nevertheless made that much more efficient. is there new ideas to be discovered in jiu jitsu still? i'd say, the reason i'd say yes is the same reason i would say i believe in alchemy, even though i don't. no, i'm serious. like i've got some backing for this. okay. you know, i guess i talk about this with a buddy of mine a lot, , and facilitative versus not facilitative beliefs. and if i don't believe something is possible and i do no investigation towards it, i'll never find something even if it's there. it's almost , it's no different than me walking up on a group of people and going , man, look at these jerks, this is gonna suck, versus me going, , i wonder what these guys are up to. i'm about to have two very different conversations, even though the players in the game are no different. my internal constitution has changed because of how i've decided to approach the situation. so although i wouldn't personally want to spend all my time trying to turn lead into gold because i don't believe that it's likely to work, only a person who's willing to spend his or her life in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that. and also in the pursuit of that, they're likely to find other things. so i think a lot of times the idea is that humanity is pushed forward by, again, it's another orson scott carb when it's human beings are in this slog, it's paraphrasing just in this slog over time. and then periodically humanity gives birth to genius, someone that invents the wheel, invents electricity, pushes us forward, comes up with the idea of governance that doesn't just start and end with the point of a sword. and these aren't common things. these are unbelievable advancements that, not just me sitting here, i didn't come up with them, but i just get the benefit of it. so i guess what i would say is a lot of times these ideas are called crazy, as we discussed on kind of offline, it's einstein was brilliant in his 20s and it was brilliant before that i would suspect, but basically gets recognized later on in life. and of course we all thought those were great ideas. the man was probably roundly mocked for giant chunks of his life. and i guess so it's neat to, i would say there's definitely in my mind things that, even if it's just combinations and new to me, new ways to see things, new ways to understand different depth of understanding, possibly new things, new positions, new ideas, because even if that's not true, the process of going through and acting as if it is and believing that and focusing and trying to investigate will make any of us, will push us all forward. whereas sitting there, obsessing over the cult of our current knowledge, i think is the biggest danger and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists anywhere. yeah, and it starts with believing the impossible, which is kind of interesting. one of the things that's really inspiring to me is to see people out there, which sadly are rare, who kind of have a combination of two things. one is they have a worldview that involves, that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy. and the second part is they're exceptionally focused and competent in bringing that, whatever the ideas in that worldview to reality. so there's certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas. there's a lot of conspiracy theorists. they have way out there beliefs about things, but they're not doing much to make the, build stuff grounded. and they're not engineers or whatever. they're just espousing different crazy ideas. but that's why you get the elon musk type characters. and the reason i bring him up a lot is because there's not many others to bring up. it's there's not many examples of it through history. the people, i mean, the guys convinced that we're going to colonize mars. and basically everybody on earth thinks that's insane. everyone except the guy that's gonna do it, right? except that's gonna do it. and you can imagine a couple of hundred years from now people will, i mean, first of all, they won't, certainly won't remember the haters. they won't remember all the people. if they do remember them, they'll remember them in a sense people were silly to think that this isn't the obvious path forward. like from a perspective, that's what elon talks about. like it's obvious that we're going to expand throughout the universe. like so- from his perspective. from his perspective. like, but to me it is also obvious because either we destroy ourselves or we'll expand beyond earth. like there's not many, you know, well, maybe it's not completely obvious. i guess i share that worldview. there's the other possibility that we humans find a sort of an inner peace where the forces of capitalism will calm down and we'll all just meditate and do yoga and jujitsu and relax with this whole tech thing where we keep building new technologies. but it's cool to have those kinds of people that just believe the big, ambitious, crazy dreams. because that's where it starts. if you want to build something special, you have to first believe that. and you also have to believe strongly enough that you're not vulnerable. and i'm speculating, but it's , i can only imagine how many people have told elon that what he's doing is crazy. so not only did he dream it up, he dreamed it up, went with it and also went with it in the face of being told that it's not going to work. and then also stepped away from the bitterness because he's done a series of really crazy impressive things. and that's only those little things that i'm aware of. and also staying away from the bitterness of every single time you did something good. initially, all i do is talk down about you. and then eventually i act as, of course, of course, i never apologize. and yet you don't let that dampen your spirits for the next innovation, which is pretty incredible to me to watch. yeah, it's kind of cool. i mean, it's contagious to spend time with the guy because he's not, rogan has the same look to him, which is interesting about these people. there's a hater shield. that he's , he doesn't even sense them, it feels . he thinks to elon, it's obvious. i mean, he keeps calling it first principles thinking. like physics says it's true, therefore it's true. like he has convinced himself that his beliefs are grounded in the fundamental fabric of the way the universe works. therefore the haters don't matter. and i mean, that's kind of a system of thought. he developed himself through all the difficulty, through all the doubt, he's able to take huge risks with basically putting everything he owes on the line multiple times throughout his life. i mean, it's all the drama, and it's all the doubts, and it's all the, he's still able to make just clear headed decisions. i don't know what to make of it, but it's inspiring as hell. well, i think it's something that's funny. i think , i can only imagine that, history will look back on him as a brilliant person, but that's not the only, there's a lot of maybe not numeric, not statistically speaking, but a lot numerically on a giant planet of billions of people, a lot of brilliant people. well, time, place, luck, fortune, all that other stuff, but at the same time, that clearly isn't the only determining thing in making elon musk, elon musk, and obviously i don't know the guy from adam, but it's an interesting thing that it's not just his intellect, his belief system, his structure, how he's viewing the world. like that's, did he reason his way to that? did he not? what other factors came in? i'm really curious about that because i guess coming, it's, again, i feel really strongly about people's belief structure and how they view the world being more important than the engine behind it. it makes someone resilient or not, it makes someone positive or not, because you could have 10,000, i think about this for competitive stuff, you could have 10,000 things going properly and one thing going improperly. if you focus on the improper, you'll probably fix it at a certain point, which is good, facilitative for development in the long term, but if you had to go and try to perform a task in the next five minutes and you're focusing on the negative, your confidence and your belief in the positive outcome of the future is likely to be damaged, whereas you could have 25 things going wrong, but you go, man, i sure am happy to be alive. how fortunate i am. this is great. i have problems to solve. this is awesome versus i list the problems and i start bitching about them. both of them are technically accurate, but it's, i guess, different lenses and i think that's a really neat thing to see someone exemplifying that for us. so maybe to look at the fighting world, there's a million questions i can ask here. like one, you mentioned bj penn. first of all, you're undefeated in the ufc and one of the fights you've had is against bj penn, which is kind of an incredible fight. you won performance of the night. what did it feel to face bj penn and to beat him definitively as you did? like what's that whole experience ? i'll be honest, i didn't know if i was going to ever be able to fight again after beating gray maynard in 2016. i've had a couple periods of those. i was about to join the army actually in when i was 30 before the ufc, before jen sent me over to ultimate fighter. i didn't want to go because i was , one, they're never going to pick me. two, i'd be terrible for tv. three, i'll probably say something and i'm going to get burned to death in the streets. i'm , this isn't a great idea. and then she said, we'll go out there, see what happens, do it anyway, you'll regret it if you didn't. and then i ended up doing ultimate fighter. and then, so i fought three times on the show and then i fought for the finale. so that's four times in five or six months, which was great. and then it took me a year to get another opponent. and that was gray maynard. and then gray was obviously a very tough guy, managed to get a good outcome there. then it took two years to fight bj penn. and that was, obviously i'm training all the time every single day and that never stops. but that was, i'll be honest, pretty deeply frustrating because as a human being, as an athlete, i think as an athlete, you die twice. like you have an athletic peak or area and then you go on with the rest of your life. it's a bit of a mystery, but it is a microcosm for the rest of your life. it's you're seeing the sand tick away in the hourglass or drop away. and you're going, man, these are the years between 31, 32, 33. i'll be at my best at this time, my absolute best physically. now not technically, i'm a lot better now than i was before on our planet. but at a certain point, you will, unless you're bernard hopkins, you will reach diminishing returns. and i guess that- the long wait, you can feel the clock ticking. is this frustrating? it's , why does it take two years for bj? that's the question people ask a lot. it's , why does nobody want to fight right now? i don't know. they probably think they'll get infected by whatever this is, but i don't blame them. but i would- i mean, you're a really tough opponent is the bottom line. i'll say that i'm different. maybe they perceive that the threat is greater than the reward. i'm hoping that now that we're ranked number 12, in the ufc rankings, that that will change. and i know that if we're one more win and then we're in the top 10, that now you're there. but what i've consistently found is that randoms want to fight. and i'm , go away. i didn't come here for you. because if i wanted to just fight anybody, i could go down to a waffle house and yell until dmx shows up and we can fight, because he'll be at the waffle house too. who am i kidding? i really want to hang out with dmx. but it's , you want to, when i had the opportunity- ryan hall and dmx at waffle house. oh my god, that was so cool. i would never- sounds a netflix show or something. i would never fight dmx. we'd be on the same team. no. anyway, i guess i accepted fights against, i got asked about lamas. i said yes. i got asked about dennis bermudez. i said yes. you know, long periods of time. and they, at that time, well, you know, in between 2016 and 2018, i was struggling to have opponents who would sign up. and i haven't turned down fights. i've just said, hey, you know, keep the, i don't care about fighting the randoms. and it's just- and you have a successful school. you're , you're running, you're a martial artist, broadly speaking. so it doesn't make sense to take fights that aren't - right. that fit a certain kind of trajectory for your career. and that's when bj penn, they said, well, bj is looking for an opponent. i was , i'm your guy. and i think that, you know, bj accepted that fight because i'm another jiu-jitsu guy. i don't think he perceived that i was much of a threat on the feet. and, you know, i was able to, it was neat to get it to compete against someone, you know, who's one of my heroes, one of the people i looked up to in mma for the longest time. were you intimidated by that? no, no, i love competing. i don't really get nervous or scared before fights. i'm not afraid to get hurt. i'm not afraid to win. i'm not afraid to lose. it's, i'm just excited for the, i feel thankful for the opportunity to compete and the opportunity to play when it matters. you know, i just, but that's the only time i'm interested in playing anymore is when it matters, when the opposition is, i know that, you know, it's funny because people pick on a lot of some opponents, particularly after the fact. like if you get a good outcome, well then, , of course, lex beat that guy. that guy wasn't that good. i'm , well, i wasn't, that's after the fact, i get to say that. and also as the person in the ring, you know, bj penn has hurt a lot of people in mixed martial arts cage. and i could actually absolutely have been on that list. so it was neat to get to compete against someone that i really respect, someone that i looked out to for a long time, someone who has a great skillset. and also i went up in weight to fight him at his weight class. he didn't have to come down to mine, which is where he'd take him. it was lightweight? it was lightweight, yeah. i generally have featherweight. i walk around at 158 pounds. so- what's lightweight and featherweight? lightweight is 155 with a day before weighing, and featherweight is 145 with a day before weighing. so i'm a little bit more properly sized for featherweight. but anyway, you know, so i didn't feel , obviously he was giving up a couple of years of age, but i was giving up size and all this other stuff. and it was, you know, i was just excited to have the opportunity to step in against someone bj. and, you know, we managed to get out of there with a good outcome without getting too banged up. but just, it was cool, because we tied up on the fence. and just even the second, you know, is when you're rolling with somebody and you touch and you can feel what they're doing, you go, man, this guy's really good. you can feel the calm. you can feel the small minor adjustments that they're making, the subtle things that they're doing. and that was one of those things that was really neat and gratifying, because, you know, you never know. sometimes people that you've heard of are a little bit less technically proficient than you thought. and other times you'll meet some guy that you train, you're , who the hell is this guy? how have i not heard of this person? and bj was exactly, as a jiu-jitsu guy, what i would have thought. and another thing, that's another thing that bugged me about how people reacted after the fight is, you know, basically going, , bj screwed up this, screwed up that. and i'm , all right, yeah, tell him. that's so interesting. that's sad. that was, you know, one of the, to me, i mean, as a fan of both, that was a beautiful moment, is a kind of passing of a torch, in a sense, of exceptional performance. like another one that stands out to me, maybe you can comment, is i don't understand, well, maybe i do, why conor mcgregor gets as much hate as he does. he probably revels in it. but i think he doesn't get enough credit for jose aldo, for the, for , for basically, you know, knocking him out in the first few seconds of a fight. i mean, jose is one of the greatest fighters ever. that's true. maybe some people could even put him in the top 10. no question. and the, , i don't understand why it's, doesn't get as much, , conor mcgregor doesn't get as much credit for, you know, conor mcgregor doesn't get as much credit as i think he deserves for that, and for eddie alvarez and all the fights. for some reason, whenever conor mcgregor beats somebody, well, they were not that good then. like, it means they were, they were, there's something was off. right. that's convenient, isn't it? yeah, it's quite strange to me. but i mean, what are your thoughts on the, on conor mcgregor? maybe one way to ask that. i'm russian, so i'm obviously also a khabib fan, but i'm also a conor fan. it seems there's not many of us who are fans of both. right. what are your thoughts? you and artem lobov. the two of us, which also is a good fight. tough dude. yeah, really, really tough dude. especially five languages, really interesting cat. oh, so, wow, i didn't know that side of it. there's a brain there. well, on the khabib versus conor, what do you make of their first fight? what do you, do you agree with me that they should fight again? because i think it would be awesome if they fought again in moscow. and do you agree with me, i'm just gonna put, say things that piss people off, but i believe is that conor actually has a chance to beat khabib. one, that conor absolutely has a chance to beat khabib. conor has a chance to beat anyone that he steps into that ring with and not just a mathematical chance. you're , , one of the billion, but , you know, he absolutely, it's funny, because i won't pretend to know conor really well, but i first met conor in 2010 when i was teaching a seminar in a straight blessed gym, ireland in dublin. and that's actually where i first met all of the coaches that ended up being on conor's team. john kavanaugh, owen roddy, gunnar nelson. so for, i actually, i enjoyed being on ultimate fighter and being on your high-favorite team and getting to train with all the guys there. but at the same time, the people that i was actually, i knew better were actually the european side, all of conor's coaches. and that was a neat thing because i got to, i met conor, i didn't know who conor, conor wasn't conor at that point. yeah, that was before his ufc division. oh yeah, well before, yeah. i think he got in 2014, maybe something that. yeah, and anyway, but he was doing well in cage warriors, winning the titles there, i think prior to that. you know, i remember going, seeing him on the show and also then getting to see him train, because i competed, i was initially slated to fight david tamer for the ultimate fighter finale before getting put in to fight artem for the title for the show. so i went over to ireland to train for a couple days. and basically it was neat to watch him work. i mean, man, he's focused and trains a lot and he's very, very smart and very, very hardworking. and i think a lot of times people get stuck in this, you know, and they almost want to believe that this was lucky or this person, you know, they're not working that hard, they're just out there, they got there with their mouth. and that's just not the case. and you know, i don't know what it's , you know, obviously conor's very well off right now and i don't know how hard, how serious he's training, what he's doing, i can't speak to any of that. but there's no question that he has skills to be dangerous. and one of the funny things, obviously, that could be fight when it could be his way, it could be he was a great fighter and also has the chance to beat anyone in that ring at any given time. but there was, conor, you know, it's one that he can put anybody away. and as you mentioned, i think that he doesn't get the credit for the eddie alvarez fight, he doesn't get the credit for the jose aldo fight because it was almost so much of a letdown. i remember that happened the same weekend at the ultimate fighter finale. and you're , wait, what? yeah, it almost doesn't feel a fight happened. but we mentioned miyamoto musashi. i mean, musashi was famous for the way he poked and prodded at people with what he was doing, whether overtly or not. it's , , we're supposed to fight to the death and, you know, at 3 p.m. tomorrow, great. 4 p.m. rolls around, i'm just not there. five, i mean, you remember all the antics and nonsense that conor was pulling prior to that. like, speaking personally, that's not something i would feel comfortable doing, but it's everyone's different. and the effect that it had on jose was, i mean, beyond evident. when was the last time jose started the fight with leaping left hand, leaping right hand? you're , wait, what? and then he was obviously, you know, living rent free in jose's head at that point. and that was a combination of psychological ability and wherewithal and then physical. and it reminded me of the way muhammad ali would bother people and whatnot. and the fact that he's a polarizing figure, i think makes some people not give him his due. and then at the same time, sometimes certain fans maybe go overboard. but remember the knee that ben askren got knocked out with by masridal. i mean, that was an amazing, unbelievable thing. but three inches to the right, three inches to the left, i guess whichever side his head wasn't, now you could have been square. but, and that fight starts with ben askren on top of you in the first five seconds. well, conor ran in through a knee just that. it could be even, could be, got right around it. that could have easily gone the other way. can you imagine what would have happened if after coming back from boxing, after coming back from the mayweather fight. conor rocks could be- in the first 10 seconds it's over and you're , he would, it would have been intolerable. but basically- yeah, but see, here's the thing. let me actually push back slightly. i mean, to the fans, correct me if i'm wrong, but conor seems to, because i've competed a lot and there's a tension, there's a negativity sometimes, depending on the opponent. and there's a respect afterwards that happens. when you understand that there's a deep respect and almost a love for each other. i always seen that in conor. all the trash talk afterwards, there's a, it's a subtle thing. you can't always see it, but there's a respect. i agree. and i almost, on the khabib side, i almost feel khabib really took it personally. he didn't, he lost the respect for conor. i thought the whole time conor had the respect. so what i wanted to say is , if conor won that fight, rock khabib, i could see , i wouldn't see trash talking. i could see trash talking stop right there. i think so too, but at the same time, i'm sure you recall conor, conor crossing some pretty personal territory, both religiously and also familiarly with khabib. and it's, i mean, i think it's the sort of thing that, i don't know, it's an interesting, that's one of the reasons. well, it depends. like you have to know the difference. so obviously i know the khabib, the dagestani people, they don't- play around that. they don't play around that. you know, i mean, they take offense to basically, i mean, you don't do that. so conor didn't, maybe he did on purpose, or maybe he wasn't even just aware of- totally fair. of- there's cultural differences. of the box he opened. like you can talk to floyd mayweather, you can go anywhere with him. you can say the most offensive things, but with khabib- it's hard lines. it's yeah, hard lines. but you, i mean, a lot of people ask, i know you're a featherweight, but if you were to face, it feels khabib is one of the hardest puzzles to solve in all of mixed martial arts. if you were to face khabib, do you think, how would you go about solving that puzzle? like almost, the question is almost from a jiu-jitsu perspective too. what do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position, especially on top, very good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position? like, let's say, so forget maybe striking. on the ground, how do you solve that guy? like, what do you do with your guard if you get taken down? or do you create an entire system of not getting taken down or escaping? is , what ideas do you have for that? well, i guess i would say in my mind, fighting is a game of trading energy. kind of, there's two things, there's damage and there's energy. so when i say energy, i mean tired, not tired, how much gas you've got. and then damage counts, obviously as well. you could be feeling, i could be feeling great and then you get to kick me in the head hard, really hard three times. it doesn't matter that i could get up and run a mile, i can't get up. so anyway, i think what khabib does so well is he makes the fight look khabib in a magomedov fight. he does a great job of avoiding damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking the life out of people with how suffocating and oppressive his control is. his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen in the ufc, it's fantastic. but that poses a really serious threat for people that need to maintain a certain amount of space and try to hurt them on the feet because unless they're able to inflict an adequate amount of damage, they're gonna, each time, let's say for instance, let's say him taking them down as a four-gun conclusion at some point. if every single time khabib takes you down, you get right back up, it's not that big a deal because it's actually more, we've all experienced this. let's say you and i are rolling, you tap me 15 times in one round, who's more tired? probably you are. my ass so badly that it's you're the only one working. but- so if you're comfortable with the up and down of it, being taken down. if you don't get hurt badly or tired on the bottom, you have a chance. but that doesn't involve just cracking him on the feet before he gets ahold of you. that's a lot. that's a lot to ask, that's a lot to ask. that's difficult to do. it seemed actually that connor, it seemed it when he was being kind of taken down or the take down attempts against khabib, he seemed to be somewhat relaxed the whole thing. i thought he was doing well actually. i think that particularly for the first round, i thought he did a very good job. it's just one of those things that i think khabib being, the fights taking place in khabib's world in large part. and i mean, set aside that one giant, what is it, right hand that khabib hit connor with. by the way, connor reacted an absolute champion. he got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his eyes went right back on khabib. it was immediate positive, great response. so even though that was, i think, that was a bit of a surprising thing, connor reacted really, really well. but if you're gonna be on bottom with khabib for four rounds, that's gonna be tough. and also connor's a way better grappler than people to give him credit for, but he's not the type of grappler that can do, that's too tall of an order. but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would have a much, much better shot at being able to weather that type of a storm. do you see yourself being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm? yes. well, i guess. i can't. remember, being savagely beaten is very relaxing. the timing of that answer was , okay. that's a dumb question. no. that's ultimately the goal of jiu jitsu is to be relaxed through the fire. for sure. and remember, every ufc fighter, i win all hypothetical matchups. yeah. for sure. that's true. since i'm one to ask ridiculous questions and we've been talking about sci-fi and all that kind of stuff, let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees about, certainly with me, is who are the top five greatest mma fighters of all time? oh man. and why is fedor number one? okay, well first off, fedor is number one. oh really? oh yeah. right there with you. really? oh yeah. talk about people that just get completely underappreciated. even though he's never succeeded in the ufc? it's not his fault it came along after him. at the time that fedor was at his height, the ufc was not where it was at for heavyweight fighting. i mean, not that there weren't good heavyweights there, but fedor was unbelievable. i mean, you remember minotaro noguera, i was a massive fan of him. i still remember watching, what is it, pride 2004 when noguera fought cro cop and got blasted with that left kick and dropped with seconds left in the first round. pride was great because it had a 10 minute first round and that five minute second, which again, materially alters the fight big time and just the texture of the fight. it's borderline a different sport than getting a five, a pause in a five. but anyway, similar sports, one of those swimming things where they have nine gold medals for different types of swimming, right? but still swimming, but anyway. well, yeah, they would disagree. yeah, i don't mean i'm not trying to. they specialize in that. but it's totally true. 10 minutes is different than five minutes. sorry, i'll take, don't drown me swimmers. i don't swim very well. it's easy for me to downplay it. but anyway, yeah, and then- so better than john jones, the modern era. well, i mean, i guess it's tough to compare across eras. it would be going and saying , man, how would such and such great grappler from today fair against someone from 1995? i'm , well, probably pretty well for them, depending upon who they are, what's going on. you know, there's some people that would, their skillsets might transition across eras, but a lot of times not, but that's not fair. we get that, they'll be comparing spartans to modern day, you know, army guys. they're , well, who's gonna win? i'm , well, did modern day army guys get modern day weapons? well, yeah, but who's the toughest ruggedest group of people at the very least? so i guess it's tough to say, but at least in my mind, the people that i think about for great fighters, their quality of opposition, their level of lasting, success, their level of lasting innovation, the courage that they have to demonstrate. because again, it's being a big fish in a small pond takes no courage. doesn't mean that there's nothing there, but it just requires something a little bit different. so kazushi sakuraba is one of my guys too. bj penn also, i mean, bj penn fought lyoto machida. that's insane. you know, that was a time, it was a different sport. it was a different time in the sport where, you know, some guys were bouncing around doing different things, but let's, so i guess the gracie family, i mean, they never had an, obviously hoist was there, but they never, and that was definitely a different sport. weight classes being open, things that. but you have to say that hoist is up there. it's one of the greatest ever. i think so too. and again, i wouldn't be sitting here talking to you if it weren't for him. so the gracie family as a whole, but i mean, who's the better, i mean, i think the hoist would tell you himself probably that hickson would have handled business back then, but they didn't put him in. so again, he's the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter, the greatest fighter that we saw do his business. so hoist up there for sure. what about, so this is , nobody seems to agree with me on this, but this connects to soccer again and messi. it seems that people value how long you've been a champion, how many defenses of the championship that you've had successfully. to me, i highly value singular moments of genius. so , i don't, if you look at conor mcgregor, he hasn't, i guess, held, been a champion very long, very much. well, he didn't defend either title, right? he didn't defend any other, either of the titles. but , if you, and the same with messi, if you look at lionel messi, there's just moments of brilliance unlike any other in history for both conor and messi. and people don't seem to give credit. it's , well, how many world cups have you won? but to me, , why is it about this arbitrary world cup thing or championship thing? i think it's easier for people to wrap their head around, right? it's the nfl combine. when was, i mean, tom's, yeah, numbers. it's something, well, again, if i go and i, if i pick tom brady in the first round, you know, and it works out, they call me a genius. if i had to pick tom brady in the first round after his combine, and it doesn't work out, i get fired and i'm never hired again. i have to work somewhere else. but it's , i'm insulating myself from criticism, i think almost, if i go by the numbers. well, he had more bench presses. it's , how many times have the guys that are the super studs in the nfl combine ever been on the greatest players in the nfl history? in nfl history, zero or close to zero? and even if there's some, it's certainly not a one-to-one correlation. so it's so funny though, i think it's just , how many days did he hold the title? ah, your title reign was x times longer. that means nothing. so if we wanted to find greatest fighter ever, you said, i think individual moments of , you're , that was transcendent, that was different. that was something else. because people can win or lose for any number of different reasons. and that's an interesting thing. again, i don't blame argentina not winning the world cup on messi. you know, that's not fair. you know, how many times has, i mean, i'll use the, i remember when trent dilfer was the quarterback for the baltimore ravens. and they had such a strong defense. i'm not trying to pick on trent dilfer, but it's , they had such a strong defense that they were to make it. that was the ray lewis, you know, chris mcallister era, you know, and they won the super bowl. i don't think anyone is going to say that, you know, trent dilfer is a better quarterback than, you know, or put him in the same category as dan marino. but he got the w. he's got the super bowl. how many times, let's use march madness or super bowl. i love it. like that guy always makes the finals, but he just never gets it done. so let me get this straight. getting to the finals nine times doesn't count because you didn't win the end game. i'm not saying it wouldn't be better, but that guy won the game once. he got over the hump. well, how many other times was he in the finals? zero? you're , all right. it's interesting what we, yeah, that we were obsessed with these numbers. like... well, cause we can't assess their method, right? i think most of the time, most of us can't assess the method of anything. it's , , look at that guy do x, y swimming. i'm , how do i know michael phelps is great? i don't know, he was faster. i can't look at his technique and say anything other than, well, that's way better than anything. i know how to do, but i can't say the difference between him and the next guy. so i guess that's, i wonder if it's , i need a concrete identifier. and a lot of times people don't saying, i don't know. and most people won't put a ronda rousey in the top even 20 or 50 of, but she changed more than, more than almost anybody else. she changed the martial arts history. i don't know if that even, i don't think i'm exaggerating that. she made it okay for women to be fighters. yeah. and it, and changed the way we see, she's one of the great feminists of our time. in her own way, yeah. in a weird kind of way that , i don't know. maybe i'm just a ronda rousey fan, but yeah, but she's not in the conversation cause then you start converting into numbers. well, how many did she win? is she among the greatest fighters or did she do the greatest things? you know, i mean, i don't, i think it's something, i mean, obviously ronda is a great judoka who was competing in mma at a time when a lot of the girls where did you get your skills in the olympics? oh, where'd you get yours? high school. you're , yeah, you're gonna, olympic girls gonna beat you up. but i guess that that doesn't diminish her. just that accomplishment is what it is. i don't have to, i don't, fedor is not diminished by the fact that he would, if he were to fight stephen miocis right now, it probably wouldn't go great. or that john jones exists. i don't now have to knock fedor's accomplishments down or say, , because bj penn or so and so, let's say he has a mixed record at this point that somehow invalidates the things that they've done before. i guess it kind of brings us back to a lot of the other people we've talked about. the fact that the brilliant people throughout history that we love or some of the monsters throughout history that we rightly revile in a lot of cases were complicated people and their legacy is more than just one thing. and someone doing something amazing doesn't invalidate, doesn't mean they didn't do anything bad. and someone doing terrible things doesn't mean that, doesn't invalidate the positives that they did. but i guess we're fighting the urge to put people in one category. and same with ourselves. i think that's why people get depressed. oh, i'm good right now. oh, i'm bad right now. versus, hey, we're all at work in progress and we're trying to do x number of things and legacy is a tough thing to figure out anyway. and it's all speculative. last time or no, on reddit, you said that, last time too, that you don't experience much fear before fights. i'd to ask you a couple of mike tyson things if it's okay. it's just interesting to me. maybe i'm just weird. so there's a, i don't know if you've seen this clip of tyson talking about how he feels leading up to a fight that he's kind of overtaken with fear as he gets closer and closer and closer to the ring his confidence grows. dad, have you seen the clip? i'm aware of it. okay. i haven't seen it in a while. here, let me play it for you. george st. pierre said something similar to me one time. while i'm in the dressing room, five minutes before i come out, my gloves are laced up. i'm breaking my gloves down. i'm pushing the lever at the back of my leg. i'm breaking the middle of the glove for my knuckle pierced through the lever. feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves on that everlast boxing glove. i come out, i have supreme confidence, but i'm scared to death. i'm totally afraid. i'm afraid of everything. i'm afraid of losing. i'm afraid of being humiliated, but i'm totally confident. the closer i get to the ring, the more confidence i get. the closer, the more confidence i get. the closer, the more confidence i get. all during my training, i've been afraid of this man. i thought this man might be capable of beating me. i've dreamed of him beating me. but i always stayed afraid of him. but the closer i get to the ring, the more confident. once i'm in the ring, i'm a god. no one could beat me. i'm a god. i mean, first of all, he's cognizant of both his demons and whatever the hell ideas he has about violence. it's so interesting. is there something about the tension that he's describing about being confident and scared that resonates with you? or do you hold to this idea that you've kind of spoken about before that you're really not afraid? no, i can appreciate what he's saying. i think that i can speak to feeling concerned about, let's say for instance, if you feel a certain way, i think people are a lot more computers than we to admit. and just because a lot of times i can't parse what's going on and why, doesn't mean that it doesn't make sense. i see. and i think that at least in the times of , if i'm concerned about a situation or about a person or about something happening prior to the fight, or i'm , there's a reason. there was a reason. i had to push that down and bury it. there's a reason. like why, what have i not thought about? what have i not done? what am i missing? why am i feeling this way? as you mentioned, for yourself prior, you'd be , why am i feeling this? i don't do this very well in certain aspects of my life if not that i mentioned it or not that i think about it. but when it comes to competing, i think i do an all right job and i'm trying to learn to be better. and it's going , well, why do i, if i feel this way, there's a reason. okay, am i thinking about this the wrong way? have i not adequately prepared for something? i have to address it. and then maybe i'll be up for four hours that night, extra hours thinking, what have i not addressed watching sparring, watching this, watching that. and then when i am thinking about things more accurately or when i've addressed what that concern was, i feel any of that concern kind of dissipate. and i guess if i honestly thought that, when it comes to it, i know i'm gonna die at a certain point, obviously. i'm gonna get hurt. i mean, pain happens, but the pain of loss would be nothing compared to the, or the pain of injury would be nothing compared to the pain of running away. and so i guess if i think about where's my value, it's , i feel i'm a winner every single time i step into that ring and fight with everything that i have. i can't promise that i'll win my next fight. i know that i have the skills and the tools to beat anyone in grappling or in mixed martial arts at this point. it's just, i know that for certain, i've trained enough people, i compete with enough people. i know where i stand, but i also know that i'm not perfect. and also the better fighter, even if i perceive that i was that thing, doesn't win on the night. the man who fights better wins on the night. and if i give credence in my mind to only the person that's one has value versus going, what's your process? what's your path through this? how are you going about this? how are you thinking about this? how are you behaving? then if i can focus on the process, then i will respect my opponent and i will respect myself and i'll respect anyone that behaves with a certain level of consistency to that. and they could win, there's plenty of winners in history that are shitbags and there's plenty of losers that are not. but winning doesn't make you a bad or good person and losing doesn't make you good by default either or bad by default. so, and i think that that can be the truth socially, that can be the truth, you know, athletically, and you know, academically. so i guess- is there a primal fear though? like a primal fear of getting hurt, the running away and not facing the threat long-term is the bigger pain than any pain you can experience in the fight. that's pretty powerful. but what about the violence of, i mean, you don't have that on your face, but , i don't know if you've also seen tyson talk about, he was on rogan recently and he was talking about, he was trying to psychoanalyze himself about why he enjoys violence so much. i mean, he called it orgasmic. i don't know, have you seen that clip? i haven't. okay, we're playing it. cause i need to, cause trump also retweeted it, which is hilarious. i don't know how to contextualize that our president retweeted the clip of tyson saying- maybe he's just doing it , they're not gonna, it's , i'm gonna throw him a curve ball. no one's gonna have any idea what that is. but yeah, he did no explanation, just here you go. there you go. well, i think that's kind of what you were describing. it's , if i give you an answer, it has to be a good one. better to just let your imagination run. exactly. yeah, he's the kubrick of our time. no, what's really interesting, that sometimes, periodic, it's not real, but sometimes i struggle with the fact of why, is there a possibility i can really hurt somebody? like you don't wanna hurt them. what do you mean, when you struggle with the possibility that you could hurt them? that is sometimes, it's orgasmic sometimes. yeah. like some fights, particularly tyrell biggs, or someone that you had problems with, someone that you- joe's not getting it. you had animosity towards, so when you finally get your hands on them. hey, what does it mean when fighting gets you erect? what does that mean? it's a good question. means you're getting excited. yeah. so that's going through your mind right now. well, that's how i get when i was a kid. sometimes i get the twinkle. the twinkle. yeah. well, that's what i'm saying, is you reached a state as a human being, as a champion, as a ferocious fighter, you reached a state of ability and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever touch and feel. that's why i'm asking you, when you're running, when you're hitting the bag, when that heart's beating again, and that you know who you are, you're mike motherfucking tyson. so when you're doing all this shit again, you're still mike tyson. those thoughts have gotta be burning inside you again. it's gotta be pretty wild. i don't know. it's wild, but i believe it's rightfully so to be that way. and i just know how to, i don't think i mastered, but i just know how to deal with it. i don't let it overwhelm me. i mean, he goes on to try to, they don't ever, joe doesn't bite. well, the interesting thing about that conversation is mike was trying to figure himself out. yeah. like he's trying, on the spot. like, why do i feel this way? to me, it was , to me, it's so real and honest to feel pleasure from hurting somebody. like that, you rarely hear that. in this society, it's , you rarely talk about, you feel pleasure from winning. you feel pleasure from the relief of overcoming, all the stress you have to go through. pleasure from just the specifics of the fight, the techniques you use, the maybe overcoming being down a couple of rounds. but , how often do you hear somebody say, i just enjoyed, he's not even saying because i hate the opponent. he's saying , i enjoyed purely the violence of it. it's crazy. i mean, i don't know, it's honest. it made me ask , i wonder how many of us are cognizant of that. i'd say mike is uncommonly seemingly honest. i think athletes make a full-time job at a line. people make a full-time job at a line. that's fair. i mean, you tell yourself, or you tell others what you feel you need to, or maybe whether you even know what you feel you need to, but why should he not? i mean, again, did he run up and just hit somebody that didn't sign up for this? no, they sign up to be there. well, that's the interesting thing about dyson is there's that weird non-standard behavior. i mean, your fighting style is non-standard. he's non-standard to another degree of , who else has that? in jiu jitsu, paul harris has this kind of weirdness. like, what's in there? like, there's a fear that i think most opponents would have because it's no longer about, it takes you out of the realm of it's game. it takes us back to the thing we were talking about before is it strips away several layers of ryan hall, the podcast guest, ryan hall, the jiu jitsu instructor, ryan hall, the jiu jitsu competitor. it keeps going down to a point where ryan hall, the murderer of all things that get in his way, that lies underneath all of it, seemingly. like, in this society, we put all that aside, but it makes you wonder, now society's being tested in many ways. it makes you wonder, , what's underneath there? well, do we want the answer to that? because i guess it's, what is it, you've seen paul fiction, the best character in the movie, in the best scene in the movie. it's , if my questions, if you're, what do you call it, if my answer's scary, you should cease asking scary questions. and i guess you wonder, i mean, all of us, that's something that i think it's funny. we go, , that's not okay. i mean, versus, maybe not appropriate for situation x, y, or z, but what should make any of us think? i mean, humanity is a different place now. and i'm not saying anything crazy out there, but humanity is a different place now than we were 5,000 years ago, where all of us are descended from people who have killed things with their teeth and fingernails in order to be where we are. and whether it was in, whether it was an animal or it was in conflict with another person, i mean, think about the chances of dying by violence now are so, so slim, at least in most countries and most places, shockingly small, thankfully. but there was a period of time, the most period of time where dying by violence was mostly how it went down. and i guess what would be facilitative, what would allow you to win back to ender's game? what allows you, if you can't do that, you are forever subject to people who can. and that's a real thing. and we're fortunate to find ourselves in a situation where we don't, where other things matter. but that is a funny thing periodically, where people, you'll see people kind of drawing at each other in videos or out in the world that clearly neither of them expect this to get serious. like, i'm just gonna yell at you, you're gonna yell at me, and it's this weird larping thing where we're both gonna go on our own separate way. all it takes is one person to be , well, i wasn't kidding. and it's , , you'll go to jail. i'm , , i know. you're gonna go to the morgue. and it's, that can happen that. like society, i mean, obviously, anyway, you could jump across the table, stab me in the eye. i mean, i appreciate, i'd hope if you don't, and there will be consequences if you do, but not from me, from the rest of society will potentially get you at a certain point. but you can decide to not play by the rules any time you want. and- it's fascinating that, yeah, that's, we've created rules based on which we all behave, but underneath there, you know, there's things that doesn't, there's motivations and forces that don't play by the rules. and it's still there. nature is metal is under the surface. seriously, and again, i pull out my phone and i'm basically saying , hey, i'm gonna, you're gonna get caught. but really i'm further antagonizing you, rightly or wrongly, you know what i mean? like, and that's an interesting thing. and i feel just people need to remember, any of us need to remember, just for any reason, just that's one step away at all times. you ever, i've had people say to me before, , , i don't feel safe. i'm , you're not safe. i'll kill you before you get out of this room. nothing you can do to stop that, nothing. i mean, but don't worry, you can do the same to me, which means i'm , , thank goodness. can you imagine how many guns are there are in this country? like, i mean, everywhere. i mean, seriously, everywhere. but that's a heartening thought, not the other way. cause people usually freak out and go, my god, gun violence, gun violence, gun violence is really not a serious issue in the united states compared to what it could be. because it means that, i mean, with the amount of guns and the amount of bullets that are out there that are in circulation, can you imagine if one in every thousand was used in anger each day? i mean, this would be a terrifying place to live. you couldn't go anywhere. so, i mean, although you could say, hey, this is more than we'd or x, y, z. it actually means that people are much more reasonable and sane than we're saying. then, or then i, then sometimes i might, my might argue. so i guess what i mean is , man, i walked to 7-eleven and i didn't get stabbed. i'm , , well that's good. because not because i protected myself with my karate, it's basically no one decided to run over and stab me because i wasn't protecting myself. it's, they stopped. so i guess we're all fortunate to live in a society that you said, nature being metal, doesn't become that big of an issue all the time. but it is funny when you get people in the ring and you go, hey, let's peel back from mr. tyson, many layers of that and say, hey, now it's okay. and it's cool that, i mean, that's what society is doing. so i've lived in harvard square for a while and we add extra layers of what safe means. like now there's a discourse about safe spaces, about ideas being violence or , yeah, but the ideas or minor slights against your personality being violence. but that's all extra layers around the nature is metal thing that it's cool. that's what progress is, but we can't forget that underneath it is still the thing that will murder at the drop of, at any moment. if aroused. one thing that i find funny though, or ironic maybe about the words of violence, offenses violence thing is that of course, that if that the belief in that then justifies my violence, my, and whether maybe not physical violence, but my response to my aggressive response to things. and i guess , which it can be gets a further aggressive response and a, kind of a tit for tat sort of situation or it goes to , well, there's 10 of me and there's one of you, so we'll get you and you can't do anything about it. but that's not morality. that's just saying that's might makes right. so i guess, again, you can understand why people do it. and there are certain, there is a progress aspect to it. but again, i guess without proper examination, i'm effectively with my 10 friends, and the force of the law, mike tyson-ing people, but not admitting to myself what i'm doing. and at least mike tyson again is honest. are you afraid of death? i mean, it's easy for me to say no, as i sit here probably not about to die, but. is this the ufc question? can you defeat any opponent? exactly, the answer is yes. the answer is of course yes. and i don't have, they're not around, they're not here, are they? yeah, exactly. but i mean, do you ponder your own mortality? maybe another context to that is you mentioned two deaths for martial artists. i think that's actually why, honestly, even though at a relatively young age, i think mortality is something that i'm aware of, maybe more than the average person. i think probably most athletes can speak to this, and anyone that's had trouble. i've managed to slide out of a couple near-death experiences personally, mostly river-related, because i'm an idiot. but i regret nothing. but yeah, thank god we're here. but yeah, it is an interesting, seeing the end, and seeing going, well, what's gonna happen. i guess, i think it comes back to kind of what we were discussing about belief structure and belief system. i think a lot of times, if i recognize that no matter what i do, it's all gonna end one day. then you go, well, why were we here? what would i do? am i gonna make it to 40? i have no idea. i'd to hope so. i had no idea that i was gonna make it to the age that i am now. am i gonna make it to 80? how much of that is in my control? much of it is not. i mean, it's so funny. it's an interesting, back to the belief structure again, internal and external locus of control. what's facilitative versus what's true? and i think accepting personal responsibility for more than is on my control is probably a positive. but at the same time, recognizing that much is not in my control. i was fortunate enough to be born in the united states, fortunate enough to not knock on wood, have a serious disease that i'm not aware of right now. i didn't do any of that. i just showed up. that was really fortunate. and i guess that doesn't diminish the fact that i've tried to make decent choices, but it works in concert with it. and i guess when you go, is death what i want right now? no, no, i should think not. and again, it's easier for me to be relatively calm about it as i'm not staring it in the face. but what i would care a lot more about is how you live. that's what's in my control. and i can't control if as i walk out of this building, a helicopter falls on me. worrying about that, i can't control. maybe i have cancer now and i don't know it. and i really hope not. but- there's something about meditating on the fact that it could end today. outside of your control, they can clarify your thinking about the fact that life is amazing. like just kind of, yeah, helping you enjoy this moment. even if life was horrible, let's say for instance, it was, you live at one of those times or places and those places still exist in this world today, that life is brutal and metal and whatever all and short and painful, would you still want it? and again, as i'm sitting here, not on fire physically, it's easy to say yes, but i would, i am confident. i still all plant my feet and say yes. any life is amazing and beautiful and a gift, an unbelievable gift. that none of us have earned for the record. i hate the word earned. a lot of times earned, yeah, you earn, but it's , there's a lot of good fortune in earning. and that's back to, do i want justice or do i want grace? and i guess we're all fortunate to be where we are, no matter where we are. and hopefully it should give us some sense of perspective, some sense of compassion for other people, but also you said, a sense of peace. if it all ended right now, would i be happy with life to this point? i'm , of course. would you to live a little longer? yeah, i would try to do more and try to live rightly to the best that i know how, which over time will hopefully continue to evolve in a positive direction. but if the answer to that is no, i guess that's always, that's a sign that what i'm doing is not what i'm meant to be doing. and i mean, you're familiar with the tecumseh? before, i've got one actually, if you could give me 10 seconds, i'll read this one out. this is a personal favorite, basically. and i think it sums up, i mean, again, it's one of those quotes on the internet, when abraham lincoln said, don't believe everything you read online. but this is, again, attributed, but it's , so live your life that the fear of death can never enter your heart. trouble no one about their religion, respect others in their view, and demand that they respect yours. love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. seek to make your life long in its purpose and the service of your people. prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. always give a word of sign of salute when meeting or passing a friend, even a stranger when in a lonely place. show respect to all people and grovel to none. when you arise in the morning, give thanks for the food and for the joy of living. if you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies only in yourself. abuse no one and no thing, for abuse turns the wise ones to fools and robs the spirit of its vision. when it comes your time to die, be not those whose hearts are filled with the fear of death, so that when their time comes, they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. sing your death song and die a hero going home. powerful words, i don't think there's a better way to end it, let me just say, we've spoke maybe five, six years ago, i don't even remember when, but i'm not exaggerating saying , you had a huge impact on my life because of the podcast. you're the reason i was doing the podcast as long as i have, you're the reason i'm doing this podcast. and it's a little, it's a stupid little meeting that you probably didn't know who i was, i didn't really know who you are, it was just a magical moment, it's a bit flap of a butterfly wing kind of situation. and yeah, i'm forever grateful, you're one of the most inspiring people in my life. so ryan, it's a huge honor that you would come here, jen, and talk with me and waste all this time, i really appreciate it, it was amazing. thank you so much, lex, it's just been a pleasure, i really appreciate you having us on, thank you.

always one step beyond logic. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",
      "{'prompt': \"......... very good stuff. i will get back to you later. jon chapman 11152000 0937 am yes but........... i'm afraid i'm still none the wiser . anyway , points of history (1) yes , we did , technically , lose the american war of independence but it was because we got sick of it and had other fish to fry in asia and africa , plus it was really a civil war because the people who beat us were , largely , first or second generation americans and , therefore , brits (for example , george washington's family home is still there close to my home town of sunderland in north-east england ) and (2) we never lost to the french , we agreed to give them the worst bit - quebec - in return for some tastier possessions elsewhere . yours respectfully jon enron capital trade resources canada corp. re nice vp and possibly pres. that fact that you asked who? begs the further question of what exactly you were up to in houston. have the brits ever really won a battle any way? (their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has resulted directly in this florida mess, and their failure to put away the french (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of my fellow canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated bilingualism). to the point, i believe san felipe is the battle field adjacent to the westheimer battle field, where the brits (or at least one of them) were purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the battle fields of san felipe, where, all the while, the canadian forces (or at least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy. peter. jon chapman 11152000 0643 am re nice vp and possibly pres. who or what the ing hell is san felipe - i don't remember the brits ever winning a battle there . jon enron capital trade resources canada corp. nice vp and possibly pres. when i look at al gore i continue to be amazed that one, let alone 50 million, americans voted for him. both clinton's and gore's continued shamelessness, and disregard for doing the right and decent thing, is only slightly less amazing than the american people (or at least half of them) continuing to find reasons to support them. my only, yet substantive, vested interest in the outcome is that we are inundated with us t.v. and i can't bear the though\", 'completion': 'written'}\n",
      "{'prompt': \"humans are fascinated by violence and you've got to ask yourself why. is it the rash guard? yes. and i talk so much shit that i'm , man, if i lose, this is going to be rough. you're learning this. shut the fuck up. i got you, man. you were powered by mcdonald's and coca-cola. i want more. and then i smacked him and he didn't want to fight anymore. eh, i'm not impressed by you. if george st. pierre and khabib nurmagomedov face each other in their prime, who wins? i'm here with three individuals, each of whom are considered by many to be the greatest of all time in each of their respective disciplines. the greatest mma fighter of all time, george st. pierre. the greatest martial arts coach of all time, john donahue, and the greatest submission grappler of all time, gordon ryan. so let me ask the first question. you guys didn't see the question, no preparation here. what is the key to your success, each of you? one thing or multiple things that come to mind? john, go first. is it the rash guard? yes. i that you choose john right off the bat. he seemed the most nervous. he's inspired us to give the right answer. for me, it's about finding a way to work in a world where most of the answers are already known. in any developed sport, by the time you enter that sport, most of the basic precepts, the major techniques, the major mechanical understandings of the sport are long since worked out. in a highly developed world, the key to success is to be able to identify some area of the industry that you're in, which is currently undervalued. so do what the other people are not doing. deeper than that. everyone has a view of, okay, these are the main skills of the industry i work in. at any given time, some set of skills, attributes will always be somewhat undervalued. they're underappreciated by the people in the game. you see that in any given industry, there are always trends which change the nature of the industry over time. so fashion trends in the clothing industry, you'll see at any given time, there's a general wave of fashion which pushes most of the people in the industry in a given direction at a given time. what makes people stand out is the ability to be able to do things that what makes people stand out is the ability to look at the various possibilities out there and say, here is something which is genuinely useful, but which is currently being underused, underutilized. and i want to bring that back in and develop it. and because it's an inherently useful product, it will be very, very successful in its initial applications against people who aren't currently using it. if you can do this in whatever industry you're in, i believe you'll be highly successful. so this applies both for actual specific techniques and the... also tactics as well in the case of jiu-jitsu. so for example, in my sport, leg locks have always been around. there's no shortage of people you can look back in history who are applying leg locks. nonetheless, as in across the industry, leg locks were undervalued and underappreciated. there was a general sense in which most of the leading figures of the sport, for most of the history of the sport of jiu-jitsu tended to de-emphasize leg locks. and when i looked at them, i said there was immense potential, but it wasn't being realized and needed to be changed. since then, that has more or less occurred. now, most people coming into the sport understand that leg locks are an important aspect and they're no longer undervalued. if anything, it's gone too far the other way and now perhaps they're a little overvalued. and this kind of fashion trend exists in every industry. and the job of anyone who wants to excel in a given industry is to be able to identify, okay, what are the things that are currently out of fashion and undervalued? and then look at what is their actual objective value and then work to bring them back to the forefront. so john brought up fashion. george is wearing a really sexy shirt. so assuming that's not the reason, is there something that comes to mind as the key to the success of your incredible career? well, of course, everybody knows the famous answer that every athletes are saying, , it's going to be genetic. i was maybe gifted at certain predisposition. i worked really hard. but i think something that people don't talk enough is when everybody sometimes go right, i was never afraid to try to go left. and i felt many times trying to do things that were not known to be things that would bring me success, but i tried it. very often, i was the first of trying new things. and i felt many times, but certain times, it gives me a certain advantage. and for example, i was sometimes fighting guys that had much better wrestling background than me on paper. and nobody before that fought those guys, nobody had dared to try to take them down because their wrestling pedigree were so good. and i didn't have on paper the wrestling pedigree to take these guys down in a fight. but when everybody tried to go right, i was going left. i fought them in a different way. and that was the blueprint to beat some of these guys. you know what i mean? yeah. so we'll actually talk about a few fights where you did just that. that's fascinating. but let's say at the high level. so gordon, again, sticking on fashion, may i compliment your incredible badass hat? i'm trying to fit in here. we should say we're in texas now, so he's become a texan overnight. so is there something you can speak to that you would attribute to as the key to your success? yeah. so first of all, there has to be a role where you don't ask us all the same questions because how am i supposed to compete with the answer john just gave? there's nothing i can do that's going to top that. but i think it's, there's many things, but i think the number one thing is just john. when i came in, i was a blue belt and i was beating brown and black belts in competition already. but he really changed my way of thinking about the sport. i would just come in and if something wasn't working, i would just do it harder and faster and more aggressively. and that just degenerated me into me spastically knee sliding into crosshawshigurami against eddie cummings for six months and then just getting heel hooked repeatedly. and i'm , this is not working. and eddie, when i met him, was a chubby librarian looking guy. and i'm , there's, i'm 6'2, a jacked, 1.70. and i'm , there's no way i'm losing to a guy who looks this, but he just kept heel hooking me. so i would just go harder and harder and it wouldn't work. and then john's , well, if you learned leg locks, you might, you might have some more success. and then i was , yeah, that probably makes sense. and from then on, i kind of just changed the way i thought about the sport. instead of doing things harder, i would actually try to get better at jiu jitsu. do you remember a turning point where you became, as opposed to being mediocre, not just in technique, but in approach to, to great? i think it was somewhere around brown belt level when i was training consistently. started training full-time with john when i was purple belt, mid-level purple belt. and towards the end of my brown belt days, i was beating up legitimate, adcc champions in the gym. so i think brown to black belt was a big thing for me. and then when i won my first ebi and i was, i submitted yuri, who won adcc and i beat roostem. so i think that was my turning point as a competitor. but i think i started to, to reach world level a little bit before that, i think somewhere around brown belt, mid-level to late level brown belt. so it's some of that mental, , was there a moment when you, after a training session, you realized i can actually do this. like i could be at the top of the world, world-class. the critical moment for me was when, i think it was right, right when i got my black belt, maybe a few months before i got my black belt, we had a former adcc champion come into the gym and we did a hard round together. and i think i submitted them four or five times and no one knew who i was. i never won anything up until that point. and i was , okay, if this is one of the best guys in the world and i could submit him multiple times around, i think that this is something that i actually could do professionally and make a, make a career out of this. okay. so the actual performance was the, you don't need to believe before you could perform. like a lot of olympic gold medalists, they, they have to believe before they can perform because they're getting their ascape for a long, long, long time. yeah. i think the best way for me to believe in something is to have repeated success doing it against high level guys. like i'm not going to just believe i can do a double leg if i can't hit a double leg on anybody. so for me, the, the belief came from the repeated success in the gym. yeah. but to get to the point where you're submitting somebody yuri simo is one of the greatest grapplers ever. it's a long journey. yeah. but i had the confidence, i had the belief in myself because of the success that i had in the gym prior to that. got it. to that event. even, and it's one step at a time. first it's the brown belts, then it's the black belts, then it's world class. okay. george, was there a turning point for you when you, you thought i can actually do this? yes. i, i always dreamed to become champion, but i think the turning point that there was, there was two turning points and there were my two losses. first, my losses to matt hughes. i went into that fight just to not lose. i was not fighting to win. and it's after the fight, when i watched the, the replay of the fight, i realized i was , i was doing pretty well, but during the fight in my own mind, i was not seeing it that way. i thought i was getting dominated by hughes a hundred percent, but when i watched the replay, i was , man, i can, i can beat this guy. i was beating him until i made that stupid mistake. so i was very frustrating, but, but that's what gave me the mentally, the, the championship level mentality. and then i became a little bit overconfident because i started beating everybody after that. and i start to believe the hype of people. when they look at me, they were , , he's the new up and coming superstar and he's going to be unstoppable. and, and then when i became champion, i, i lost to, to, to matt, to matt serra. so before i believe my first failure was because i had a lack of confidence. and, and my second failure was, i was because i was overconfidence. so i think it's, there's a perfect center of confidence. i mean, i mean, it's good to be confident because john taught me confidence. it's, it's money in your bank account. if you, you can have all the skills in the world, right. and, and if you're, if you don't have the confidence, it's , you, it's , you can, you can be a millionaire, but you don't have access to your bank account. so, so it's, that's a little bit the analogy that john told me. so that's how i feel confidence plays for an athlete, but to be overconfident, i think it's always good to, to be aware, to be afraid of what can happen. so to have a perfect balance of confidence and fear to me, that's what mentally gave me the edge to become, i believe successful in my sport. playing off that, john gave me a speech one time and he was , you have to be able to flip a switch and turn it off where a guy mayweather or someone who goes out who's super confident and he plays the character of someone who's , no one can beat me. i'm the best that there ever was. and that's it. but if you look at them, it actually trains very hard. you can't, you can't play the persona of no one can beat me and then have it translate into your life and just think that you're so good that you don't have to do anything and no one could ever beat you. you have to be able to play that public persona of no one could beat me. but then you have to actually do the training to make that happen. you can't just, you can't believe your own hype and say that, you know, i can just do whatever i want. no one's ever going to beat me. you have to be able to switch between the persona and the actual athlete. and that made a big difference for me. it's tough because you're, you, you dominate such a large fraction of the world and grappling and the george too, just the perfect dominance after those two. it's hard for the confidence not to just, , how do you avoid the confidence, not becoming a thing that weighs you down where you completely deludes your mind? for me, it's just, number one, the guys in the gym are so tough. so the guys in the guys in the gym i train with are always nipping at my butt and always giving me new problems to solve. and for me, it's really just about trying to learn new stuff over time. so that keeps it interesting for me. and it's not really about, you know, no one can beat me. i don't have to train or have to do whatever i can do, whatever i want. it's more, what keeps me in the gym is more about the fact that i'm learning new stuff all the time and working on something new and progressing to new levels at all times. it's not, i don't just come in and do the same thing over and over again. and that gets boring. you just come in and you don't learn anything new and you just do the same stuff for years at a time. and , okay, this is boring. but when you have new stuff to work on and new goals, short term and long term goals to reach, then it makes it interesting. for me, it's a little bit gordon says is the fair because sometime in the gym, even before when it was competing, i was getting my butt kicked, but i don't care what happened in the gym. i mean, it hit my ego, of course, because i'm a proud person, i'm a competitor even in the gym, but it's not a malicious competition in between each other. when you fight, you have to be malicious. you go there to hurt the guy. but it hit me in terms of my pride when i get beaten in the gym, of course, but that fear that i don't want it to happen in public, especially not during a fight, that's what keeps, helped me keep the balance between confidence and and fear. you know what i mean? it's kind of weird. it's a mixture of both that i believe, to me, helped me succeed to have the right mindset to fight. and i talk so much shit that i'm , man, if i lose, this is going to be rough. yeah. that's a hard thing to do when you talk shit, when you play the heel. you have to perform. the pressure is, i mean, you have to be good under pressure. it's the conor mcgregor thing. you know, the reason i actually started talking shit was actually indirectly because of george. because i won. i would become the opposite of george. i won my first ebi and i didn't talk shit. and everyone was being , , you know, he only beat yuri because he was tired or, you know, this or that. and if they have a rematch, under any of the rules that he would have lost. and i'm trying to figure out what i'm going to do. so i'm scrolling through george's feed one day and he posted a clip of him beating someone. and i look at the comments and i'm with this in mind, i'm , george is the nicest person of all time. and if you look at the comments, it's 10,000 comments and 9,900 are just people calling him , all you do is lay and pray, you pussy, you suck, you can't finish anybody. and i'm just, i'm looking at this and i'm , people are going to say what they're going to say regardless. they're going to talk shit regardless. so you may as well just say whatever you want and then just be yourself. is there some aspect that's mentioned kind of mcgregor, he crossed the line with khabib, at least in the eyes of khabib. is there something you ever regret about crossing the line or does that, do you ever feel there is a line or do you just keep pushing the line? uh, i basically play it per person. i just, i basically fire back with one step above what they do. it's always plus one. yeah. yeah. okay. um, so i go, i usually go hard, they fire a bullet and then i drop a duke. and then, and then after that initial shot, then we go back and forth and i'll just keep one upping them. so, you know, there's a lot of people that love you, but there's also a lot of people that love to hate you. yeah. so what do those people energize you or do you just, uh, or is it funny to you? like what, as an athlete, as a performer, do you just not think about them? it's a fun thing. it's , it's just a fun thing that keeps me occupied. like, because , because most of them that talk shit, they just say stuff that's factually incorrect. so then i just argue with actual statistics. yeah. it's just , you suck or you're not going to beat this person. i'm , i've already submitted that guy. um, so i just, it riles them up and it's just, it's just a fun thing for me to do my, my downtime. yeah. your responses are usually very factual. it's very scientific. i appreciate, you, you actually, you start by talking trash, but then you respond with science. yeah. it's great. okay. it's a good mix. that's a good mix. um, i mean, on the topic of haters or more specifically sort of doubts within yourself, or doubts around you as you're coming up, um, maybe george, you can comment. i won't just ignore john completely in this conversation. i was going to ask you another question, but let me just ask you on this, on this topic. um, are there times in your life yet, uh, you were surrounded by people that, that doubted you? oh, all the time. and so what's, is there something you could say as in, by way of advice, how you overcome the doubt, either yourself or others around you? all the time. uh, all the time. uh, the first time i manifest my desire to become a professional mixed martial art athlete, everybody doubt me. just not even, i'm not talking about the ufc, just to become a professional fighter. everybody doubt me. and i became a, i became a professional fighter. i had few amateur fights. i won them all. then i fought my first fight in, in, uh, montreal. i won and i became a professional. then i, i told people that i wanted to fight in ufc. everybody doubt me again. so it's a normal thing. so i worked my way up a bit. a few guys. then i, at the time, uh, pete spratt was, uh, just not knocked out robbie lawler with leg kick. and, uh, the person who was my agent at the time did a great move, uh, for me. so he brought pete spratt in montreal to fight me. pete spratt came to montreal. i, and i believe he didn't know who i was. so he thought that he was coming to collect an easy paycheck and i, and i ended up beating him. so that gave me the opportunity to fight in ufc. then after i was in ufc, i wanted to become champion of the world, you know, but matthews was there and he seems invincible at the time. so everybody doubt me again. and i became world champion. and after when you, when i was world champion, i wanted to be, i was competing against other world champion of other weight class for the title, you know, for the legacy and everything. so it's not no longer competing against my opponent. i was, you know, as a competitor, you always, you never want it to be, you never want to be satisfied because when satisfaction is the death, you know, when you're satisfied, you better retire because it's over. so i always have to find motivation, what you can have more. i want more. don't be satisfied in life. so i want it to be the best, you know, as i was competing, you know, to become the best. and, you know, of course people doubt you all the time. every time you say something that it's outside of the norm of the normality. i want to say there's nothing normal, but i'm talking about when you, you manifest your desire to do something that takes special attribute to, to, to succeed or, or that is something that is hard to do. it's for sure. you're going to always have people that doubt you. it's so strange that people don't, they don't lean into supporting, people that love you too. yeah. even people that love me used to doubt me. and i believe i, i, you need to use that as a positive, positive thing, as a motivation to prove them wrong. so for me, that, that was a thing. when someone doubt me, nothing gave me more, there's more energy because i want to prove him wrong. i want to look at him in the face and say, hey, you see, i got you, man. i did it. so, uh, john, do you ever use this in one way or the other by saying, i don't think you can do this to motivate them to prove you wrong or more general question of, um, you know, uh, the, the mental toughness required to achieve or confidence required to achieve greatness. like what's your role as a coach when you have these two athletes with regards to your, your first question, would i ever say to someone, you can't do this as a kind of reverse psychology? i know, um, uh, my job is to prepare people first and foremost with their skills. and, uh, as gordon pointed out earlier, if you're in any way, a rational human being, and you're noticing that you're getting tremendous success with a given move in the gym against high level opponents who give a good read on what your actual opponent and a competition is, is , is , you would have to be a moron to not recognize that kind of success and say, this is something i should be building into my game. and you will carry the confidence that you earned in the gym into the arena. so i never try to use reverse psychology. i build up, uh, everything i do in terms of confidence is to give people physical skills. i know people say, , there's physicality on the one hand and there's mentality on the other. and confidence is squarely in the mental aspect of the game, but all the underpinnings and beginnings of confidence are physical. okay. a rational human being will see where they're having success and where they're having failure and confidence will, uh, surround those areas where they're having success and will degenerate in cases where they're having a failure. so my job as a coach is to set them up for success in the gym with a given set of skills. and i don't have to do anything psychologically after that. i just, if i can set you up to be highly successful with a given move or a set of tactics 10 times in a row against quality opposition in the gym, i don't have to do a damn thing when it comes to instilling confidence. i will tell people, hey, you're doing a really good job with that move. it's working well for you. but when they nod in agreement, i'm not trying to force anything on them. they're recognized. they are. they already recognize that long before the words came out of my mouth. but on the other hand, intelligent, rational people will recognize when they're failing with given moves and no amount of talk on my part can ever change that. if i teach gordon, uh, a given arm lock and 15 times in a row, he tries it over a month and all 15 are failures. there's nothing i can say verbally to come up to gordon and say, hey, you're really good at that move. he's going to look at me and say, bullshit, i'm terrible at it. and that will create a crisis of confidence where gordon no longer believes the words coming out of my mouth. so i will never compromise that. but isn't there a lot, you just said 15, you have to believe that, uh, doing this arm lock 15 times over a period of a month is worth it because eventually you might get it. yeah, that's a separate issue. that that's a separate issue. um, there are times where i've more or less pushed athletes to go in a certain direction. for example, um, when i first met gary toner and he never had a guillotine strangle, and i, i would say, don't carry, you know, you're a scrambler. like one of the greatest weapons of scrambler can ever develop as a guillotine. like it should be in your arsenal. and he was , no, i just scramble for the back. and i said, well, there's going to be a day you can't take someone's back. and it's always good to be able to strangle from front and back. okay. of course we all prefer a strangles on the bank. that makes sense. but there's going to come a day where it's going to be useful for you. and so that was one of the few times where i put my foot down and said, you're learning this shut the fuck up. and, um, uh, you're literally wouldn't teach him any, uh, anything else until he got a guillotine. gary would ask him a question. he's , let's say you're guillotine. and, um, for the first three months as gifted as, as gary toner is in learning most moves, most moves gary gets it in minutes, there was something going on with gary. just couldn't get a guillotine on people. and, uh, finally after around three months, he started having some success until ultimately it became one of his best weapons. um, we had to go through 15 different variations of guillotine until he found one, which actually worked reliably for him. and that was one of the few times where i put my foot down and said, no, you have to learn this. so the long search had to do more with the physical characteristics. like you couldn't figure out the right kind of, it made sense in the case of gary toner because there were more opportunities per minute of his grappling for guillotines, uh, that the investment in time was worth it. for another athlete, i might've said, well, he hardly ever gets in the situation, but front and headlongs of guillotine. so it's not even worth investing the training time. let me ask you a question on the, on the competition side mentioned haters and do you think about this aspect of the competition with the athletes? it's a great question. and, um, the answer is no. um, uh, i'm, you can see that you could, you couldn't find two more polar opposites psychologically than, than george st. pierre and, uh, this monstrosity on my left. and, um, i've, i've never said to my athletes, hey, i think this is the sort of demeanor you should carry yourself with. i'm myself a very flawed character and i'm the last person on earth who should be delving out moral advice to other people. um, the only thing is that i, you know, of course i believe some things are off limits, but as long as it's done in the context of sport where no one's physically attacking people or doing anything crazy where it just goes completely over the top, then, uh, i give almost zero, um, moral advice to my athletes. i'm a jiu-jitsu coach, not a preacher. alex, i, if i can, if i may, we are entertainers, you know, we're, we're athletes, we're professional athletes, but we make, we make a living because of people are, want to see us perform. same thing, an actor, same thing, a singer. and a lot of the time, especially in the fight game, uh, an event is promoted. it needs to be with emotion. love me, hate me, but do not ignore me. um, and you know, it, when it's authentic and it, it's done well, i think me, my personally, my, my favorite fighters to watch are the ones that are, that, that have a sort of, some sort of a bad persona. i really enjoyed watching those guys because they bring an emotion element into a fight, which is great. you know, i, i feel to me, it's more interesting to watch when there is an emotion involved. and i believe that's why some fighters make more money than others, you know, you know what i mean? that's the reason why we may, we can make a living out of this. yeah, they're better entertainers, but you're right. the authenticity seems to be really important. there's actually something very interesting there. um, it's time to break out some, some secrets. do you know who, , you think of george st. peter, you think of the highly technical polished martial artists. do you know who his favorite fighters to watch were? you'd probably be thinking, oh, probably someone who's really technically advanced. actually it was mark coleman, kevin randleman and phil barone. he used to love watching that. that was a hammer house. that was his favorite. he would love those guys. and whenever their fights were on, george would be watching the hammer house crew. and, uh, it's funny what you said about how those guys bought an intensity to, to mma that was off the charts. have you ever met those guys in, uh, in their prime? let me tell you, it was, it was something to behold. and, um, i had this crazy larger than life personality that most of the things i did made no sense whatsoever, but that was their appeal. and there were these guys and george loved to watch them more than anyone else. you never knew what could happen with these guys. i remember when mark coleman won the pride grand prix, i was in my living room, i was jumping. i was so happy. i was , yeah. he beat igor varcher and that was , to me, it was amazing. you know what i mean? because of the emotion that they brought into the fight. george is actually very, um, interested by something you said that normally when i, um, ask what is the appeal of a given fighter, um, and what makes people watch a fight. you, you talked about the idea that fighters are entertainers and that's absolutely correct. they are. um, it's this weird, weird industry where you're, you're both an athlete and an entertainer and you need to be successful in both regards to become, uh, financially successful in so far as, uh, your favorite athletes to watch, at least with people who are almost the polar opposite of who you are. um, i've always said that most people, if you look at, uh, say a million people watch a pay-per-view event, what percentage of those million people have a genuine technical understanding of what's happening as they watch a fight? it's tiny. it's absolutely tiny. the vast majority of people who watch a professional fight have almost no technical understanding of what's going on in front of them. so how do they relate to the fight? what's the only way they can? it's through emotion. and so when they get a sense that these two don't each other, then they can relate to the fight, but only a tiny percentage of people watching a given professional fight can relate to it on a technical level. the overwhelming majority will always form an emotional attachment to the fight. that's why when you see things, shows that usc primetime, they never focus on the tactics and the techniques of the fight. they focus on the emotional elements, the preparation, the view of their own family members as athletes get ready. it's always an emotional pull because that's how 99 of the viewers relate to the fight. if i have, think about chess, okay? if i have minimal knowledge of two world champions coming to fight each other or match up against each other in a game of chess, i know so little about chess tactics and i can't really form any kind of technical appreciation of what's going on on the board. but if you tell me that these two chess players hate each other's guts and they've got a rivalry which goes back five years and they've said this and that about each other in public, then suddenly my ears break up and i'm , , okay, this sounds interesting because i just don't have the knowledge to appreciate what's going on on the board in a chess game to be able to appreciate the technical nuances of what they're doing. so any interest that i have in the chess match is going to have to come from some kind of emotional level because i'm just not qualified to make technical assessments. and that's exactly how it is in the case of both grappling and mixed martial arts. that's why the ones who evoke the most attention are always the ones who can form some kind of emotional appeal. conor mcgregor was the all-time master of this. i believe also emotion can be used as a weapon. for example, i've learned this from my favorite boxer is sugar ray leonard. sugar ray leonard, i remember, i was very young so i watched his fight later when i was older, but i know that sugar ray leonard was the best boxer of his era to me personally. and i don't think nobody could beat him. i think he was skill wise, he was the best. however, when he fought in montreal, roberto zuran made it in a way that leonard became very emotional. he wanted to stand in front of zuran and fight a different fight that he normally does because he wanted to show that he's a man. and he lost that fight, which was a mistake. so then later on, he beat roberto zuran quite easy. everybody remembered the no mass thing. but my point is emotion can be used in a way that it can derail your opponent out of his game plan. and i felt a lot of my opponent trying to do that with me. so that's why i never got involved. that was my way to defend myself against some kind of bullying to put a shield in front. but some other guy gordon, he expressed himself differently. of course, there's a language barrier, but for him, he's better at giving back. he's a better counter attacker. that's the way he responds to the aggression of an emotional attack. i think everybody is different in that regard. what's interesting that john said that he doesn't study the tactics of this game, or maybe you're not interested in the tactics of this game, because it seems this is more than just being an entertainer. it seems it could be an effective part of the match. yeah, i just feel whatever investment you make in that is, it's going to get negligible rewards. first of all, it's probably going to pertain to one match in front of you rather than the totality of your career. whatever gains you get out of psychological trickery and play typically don't last long. you've raised an excellent example with sugar ray leonard. he did fight outside of his usual manner in that regard. but rather than me try to tell someone, hey, behave this before a fight, i would have been probably more forceful between rounds with an athlete and say, no, you're fighting this fight the wrong way. that would have a much more beneficial impact on my athlete than psychological trickery before a fight. i believe another example of emotion that leads to failure is jose aldo against conor mcgregor. i think it was on purpose that conor mcgregor did this, tried to bait aldo to become over-aggressive to open himself because he's an excellent counter puncher. that's what i believe he made a mistake. there's another great one. my match against cyborg, 2018 nogi worlds, where he didn't even try to win. he just wanted to smack me in the face the whole time because he was so angry. i was talking shit to him before the match and it was the finals of the absolute. it was the biggest match of the weekend and he just didn't even try to pass my guard or do anything. he just wanted to hit me in the face and i was , sick, i just won. it was incredibly frustrating. it's fascinating to watch a grown man lose composure. gordon, one thing i've always been very impressed with you and that's no matter how heated talk gets before a match with you, when you go out to grapple, you're absolutely cold. you've never gone into a match carrying anything other than just cold-blooded calculation. you've always been able to separate very well the idea of words and deeds. i think that's always been one of your strongest assets. the way i often measure this is when a match is over, i will ask the athlete questions about the match. if they can't answer the question, what were you doing in the fourth minute? what was that setup you used in the third minute that got you into the kimura lock? if they can't answer that, that tells me they were just fighting on instincts and emotion. but with gordon, it's a log book. it's , okay, in the seventh minute, you went for that jujikitami setup from on the left side. what were you thinking? he can always give an answer. he's absolutely stone cold. speaking of emotion, gordon, you will potentially, if you're healthy, face andre galvao in the adcc coming up superfight. who is andre galvao for people who don't know? can you tell the story of your beef with the emotional interaction with the man? andre is considered the greatest adcc competitor of all time, multiple time black belt world champion, winningest adcc champion ever. he has six gold medals. i've been trying to compete against him pretty much forever. since i got my black belt in 2016, i've been trying to get matches with him. he was in the first ebi that i did and he ended up pulling out. then i've been trying to get matches with him. he would always say no and give one reason or another. then after the last adcc, i was , hey, andre said he was retiring after this competition. if he wants to retire, he's the greatest adcc competitor of all time. i think it's great. but if he wants to compete, then that's great. i was , super nice. then he started posting pictures of me and started posting passive aggressive instagram captions. then we started going back and forth on the internet. there was one point where i saw him in person when he acknowledged, he's , i understand what you're doing. we're going to pump this fight up. he was totally on board. but then there must have been something that happened where it changed from him going along with it to being actually pissed. then there was that one night at flow where i went to go shake his hand and he flipped me off. then he followed me backstage and started to try to fight me. then i smacked him and then he didn't want to fight anymore. he's actually blocking me on instagram now. he just won't engage. no one from atos will engage now. but it's going to be interesting how he shows up, if he can keep it under control or not. how do you explain that level of emotion? is this fear of losing your throne? is it just the human being with cyborg just becoming emotionally unstable? it might just be me. i just have a way to get under people's skin. he was cool for a while and then i just, i don't know. everyone gets this. they're all so emotional by the time they actually step up to compete that it's pretty easy to read them. they're either so emotional that they want to actually come forward and beat me. tim spriggs is a perfect example at adcc. i posted on my story on instagram, 10 minutes before our match, i said, what i'm going to do to tim spriggs is going to be criminal. he's a very stalling guy. he saw that and then he came out and actually tried to fight me. he came and actually engaged my guard and i ended up submitting him. it either has that effect or it has the effect where they know i've talked so much shit leading up to the match that they're so afraid to lose that they just get super stalling and they move away. it either has one effect where they come forward and they want to beat me, beat me, or they're so afraid of getting submitted that they know if they engage, they're super cagey and they just back away and don't really do anything. do you think this match happens? there's a lot of variables. one, i have to see how my stomach is and two, if i'm actually going to show up and compete, my stomach's healthy. i doubt that andre will actually show up to compete. i've been trying to compete against him for six years and he hasn't done it. there's no reason to think he would now. is it possible for you to speak to where your estimates are about your stomach or is it too unclear for now? it's still too early to tell. i have this round of treatment that i'm doing until late february and i'm pretty sure that i need to do the same test i did initially to retest all my levels and then go from there. i've been feeling a little bit better. it's not nearly as bad as it used to be. i was explaining to someone the other day, for the last four years, i would be so nauseous that every time i would walk into a new room, i'd have to actively locate a garbage can in case i have to throw up. i'm one step above that right now. i'm doing a little bit better than that. it's definitely getting a little bit better, but it's not where it needs to be. can we talk about diet for just a sec? both of you, george and gordon, suffered from stomach issues of different kinds and have arrived for now at different places. can you maybe, george, speak to the general question of what is the best diet for performance, for training? what have you learned through your career about this? i think everybody is different. to me personally, i implement fasting, time-restricted eating, and prolonged fasting. what's the longest you've done so far? the longest i've done is five days. i do it quite often. i do four times a year. i do three to five days water fast. i liked it. it helps me with inflammation. i think it boosts the immune system. i read papers about this. it helps me also feel good. it's very therapeutic. physical and mental or just mental? mental and physical because when i break my fast and i sit at the table with other people, it doesn't matter what i eat. if we all eat the same thing, i always tell them, i said, my food right now tastes better than all of yours. i have this thing that i believe sometimes you need to put yourself into suffering to realize how pleasurable something is. diet-wise, i eat whatever i want, whenever i want. i no longer have any problem with this, but if i would have a competition coming up, knowing what i know now about my body, i would orient myself more towards an animal-based diet. that's because i've tried different things and that's the kind of diet that i believe helped me having less inflammation and feel better in terms of performance for doing something physical. so high protein, high fat, low carbs. well, this is different between animal-based diet and keto. there's carbs, there's a lot of fruit. i get a lot of the carbs from the fruit, a lot of organs. i know a little bit about paleontology and the past about prehistoric humans and i know that. not only about that, i know because i've traveled certain places in the world, i went to visit the maasai in africa, the yantargeta tribe. i know that when they kill an animal, they go for the organs first. i know most predatory animals, they do the same thing. so organs, i believe is something that normally in our culture in the western part of the world, we don't really eat, but it's something that is very nutritious. have you been able to convince gordon to try fasting? we always talk about diets. it's a different situation, i think, for gordon because he's an heavyweight. he doesn't want to lose weight. my range was welterweight and middleweight, but the heavyweight, it's some of the guys that can compete against, they might be 300 pounds. so if you lose weight, it's a big problem. and there are things that will work for me that might not work for gordon. so you have to make his own experience. and i told gordon, sometime when everybody goes left, try to go right, see how you feel with certain things. experiment. not a topic that's part of your optimization, optimal performance formula? well, what i used to do before my stomach issues, and for those of you listening who don't know, i had recurring staph infections in 2018. and i took a bunch of oral antibiotics and it just completely wiped out my stomach. so i just was diagnosed, i was misdiagnosed as gastroparesis. so for those of you messaging me on instagram who are just watching rogan asking me about my gastroparesis, that's not what i have. they misdiagnosed it and i did some other tests. and for four years, i didn't even know what it was. and then i got this, i went to this doctor in california who diagnosed me with, i have h. pylori and then a fungal and a bacterial overgrowth in my small intestines. so the issues in the small intestines. so what i used to do was i used to do seasons where i'd have a very clean season where i was competing and i would have a lower body weight. and then i would do an off season, kind of a bodybuilder where i would eat a lot more food and a little bit dirtier food. and i would have cheeseburgers and pizza at nighttime to have the extra calories. but now i can't eat those foods because they upset my stomach. so now i pretty much just try to eat whatever i can and maintain the weight the best i can based on how my stomach feels. so right now it's rice and chicken, eggs, fish, vegetables, fruits, and pretty much nothing else. like anything hard to digest, anything spicy, red meat, fast food, all that's hard for me. which sucks because in texas. all the best things. yeah, barbecue. and i mean, this diet is really important for you, john, i can tell. like, is that something you think about for athletes at all? again, this is part of the... no, i've, to be honest with you, i've never seen any measurable improvement in sports performance in jiu-jitsu by change of diet. i do believe that diet is important for longevity in human beings. and i do think it makes a difference, especially once you get past the age of 40. with regards to longevity, for older athletes, i do believe it makes some difference. but my observation is in athletes, in their youth and working up into their prime, i've seen athletes have the worst diets. god bless travis stevens for that guy won an olympic silver medal basically on mcdonald's and candy. george st. pierre for 80 of your career, you were powered by mcdonald's and coca-cola. to gene alfredo, that was my meal of choice before a championship fight. gordon for him, his youth was just five guys hamburgers, gary tonen, same thing. i've worked with japanese judo players who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day and won olympic gold medals. i've worked with russian wrestlers who just ate whatever was put in front of them. and their athletic performance was outstanding. i've worked with other guys who did have what would be considered a very clean diet and their performance was no better than anyone else on the mat. so i've never seen someone say, okay, i changed my diet. and because of that, there was a measurable improvement in sports performance. another way to phrase it though is i have noticed with a lot of elite athletes, what they eat, they begin to believe that either is not a hindrance or it's actually good. travis steve is an example of somebody who eats shitty because he believes it's a power because whatever he's traveling across the world, he can't rely on healthy, good food to be there. so i'm going to eat shitty so that my body knows how to perform under whatever skittles or whatever. everywhere's got mcdonald's. everywhere's got mcdonald's. and they've convinced themselves, and you talk about russian athletes, a lot of them have very strong beliefs about this particular food being good for them. but there's no agreement among them. exactly. no agreement. yeah. yeah. so belief is more important than the actual diet. yeah. if i can, after a night out when you're hanging over, i think the best thing, and i'm saying this in all sincerity, i think the best thing to eat to me was cheeseburgers. we call that a poutine back home because it's very fat. it's greasy. so the next day when you wake up, i think you feel better because it absorbed the alcohol. there you go. you can train and then spit the gas. my mom told me the same story once. and then i was hungover for some party. and i woke up, i was probably 19 or 20, i woke up and my mom was , yeah, just have a cheeseburger. go eat something greasy. and i did. and i was , , i feel kind of better now. i do not know the science, the exact science behind it, but i always notice, and i don't know if it's placebo, but i always notice that if i party hard and i've been drinking a lot, if i don't eat before i go into bed, if i don't eat shitty food, the next day i will wake up and feel worse than if i eat shitty food, i feel better. i know it sounds crazy. i don't know why, but it works for me. yeah, but it's also hard to do science on extreme performers. so the discussions we're having is amongst the very elite. this might not apply to a general recreational athlete, but for the elite. i've just seen champions in every kind of combat sport and i've never seen a correlation between dietary habit and performance in people under the age of 30. i do believe that diet is important for longevity, however, and for that alone, it may well be worth investing time in it. but with regards to sports performance, at least in jiu-jitsu, i've never seen any significant difference. we had a little bit of a difference of opinion on this, i think. what about strength training and muscle building, or at least we had a discussion about this. so what do you believe is the value of training outside of the sport? so fitness, lifting heavy, lifting explosive, all kinds of lifting. personally, for me, i believe, and i've learned that from john, i used to train a bodybuilder before because i thought in my early days of competition, that was the most efficient way to do things because i was watching jean-claude van damme, arnold schwarzenegger. we thought back in the day that was the thing, that that's how we should do it, to get ready for a fight. but i realized later on that it's all about efficiency. and some guys, they don't lift at all and they're doing pretty well. so i do cross training mostly for longevity. it's mostly for a therapy. it's more therapeutic than for performances to keep my body healthy, to do certain movements that are different than what i do every day in the gym, in combat sport, to keep me healthy and athletic. so all the interesting movement stuff that you've done outside the sport, that was for therapeutic? mostly therapeutic. i think it does, it could transcend to performance, but it's mostly therapeutic. i do not believe that squatting five plates or bench pressing three plates will make me a better fighter. i do not. i believe actually it could hurt me more, it could damage me more than benefit me. so gordon, as somebody who on instagram posts a lot of pictures of you being shredded, shredded and huge, what's the value of strength? so i do a combination of, john got us big into gymnastics type movements, toes to bar and muscle ups and things that when we were young. like toes to bar because that's the exact motion you have to do when you're retaining guard, knees to chest. so i do a lot of that stuff in combination with, i do a lot of opposite of george, i do a lot of bodybuilding workouts where i do a basic split, a chest and triceps, back and biceps day. and my idea is that weightlifting should always be a supplement to jiu-jitsu. so you shouldn't be missing a jiu-jitsu session to lift weights. so i don't do, i do probably, i train jiu-jitsu every day and i lift three to four times a week. i feel lifting seven days a week for me is too much and the lifting takes a lot of energy when you do hard lifts that. but my idea is if you want to get good at jiu-jitsu, do jiu-jitsu. and if you want to be bigger and stronger, lift weights and eat food. and i generally don't go super heavy when i lift because you start putting crazy weights then start tearing muscles and stuff. so i usually do moderate weights with a very high rep range, four sets of 20 with a drop set at the end to fatigue the muscles, break the fibers and grow. okay. so four sets of 20, that's interesting. so that's more for endurance and raw strength. yeah. and also i think closer to competition, i'll pick the intensity up. and while there's no real way to get significant gains in vo2 max, i think that lifting and just getting used to mentally redlining gets me kind of in competition shape. because a lot of times in jiu-jitsu, the guys i'm training with, they're not on a technical level where they can physically exhaust me to the point where i feel i'm going to die. but i get most of that when i'm wrestling because i'm not as efficient in wrestling. so i get a lot more tired. and lifting, if you do four sets of 20, leg press to squat and you go back and forth, you're about to die at the end. and i feel it gets me in the mental habit of redlining before competition. but does muscle help you? it's the actual mass of muscle this. so i think being stronger will always help in a combat. will always help. yeah. to some degree, it's not going to be to a degree where it overrides efficiency, but i think that they can't help being or can't hurt being stronger. there's a bunch of people who believe, depending on the sport, that strength can quickly become, that can have detrimental effects to efficiency. i agree with that. i mean, if strength is very cleanly, purely applied to the exact movements of the sport. so in judo, the explosiveness you need is very difficult to replicate in any kind of way except by doing judo. yeah. i mean, for us, you always have to understand there's only so much technique that can overcome a certain amount of strength. like if we all try to fight a silverback gorilla, it's going to kill us. but that being said, i do think that, , for example, heavyweights are usually the least technical because they rely on their size and strength to beat smaller people. but i think that if you stay with the discipline of doing everything very precise, and i train with a lot smaller people most of the time, so i get out of the habit of using my strength. i think if you're very precise with the way that you train, i think that the extra size and strength can help you. quick question. how would you fight a silverback gorilla? i mean, which animal do you think you can actually defeat that would be impressive, that most people would say you can't? you know, i actually, i don't have an answer to this. i want to say that me and john had a four-hour discussion on this one time. i'm , what would win, bear or gorilla? and he went into this whole dissertation about how jaguars spin underneath and barren bowl silverbacks and kill them and rip their artery and their legs out. it was amazing. okay. so before we talk about strength, john, let me ask you, what do you think people would be surprised by if two animals faced one of them would win and people wouldn't predict that. so they would be surprised by the effectiveness of certain animal at fighting in the, whether it's in the forest, in the jungle. so let's... slow down here. okay. so there's two animals of different species fighting. and most people would pick, for example, the lion gets a lot of credit for some reason. i'm not exactly sure why the king of the jungle. well, i, you know, a lot of people told me that the lion, for example, the tiger can be a lion. yeah. this is one of those age old debates. well, in grappling, in fighting, it feels some animals use teeth and some use other parts of their body also. like bear, actually, i don't even know how they... they have extraordinarily powerful and long claws. and in addition, they're powerful biters as well. so i wonder, and the same with the silverback. i don't know how much they're... i love that we're having this discussion. we need joe rogan for this discussion. i think so. yeah, i think so. so your question has gone in about five different... so it started with strength. and let's go back there, which is, do you think for an athlete, let's stick to grappling. do you think strength is helpful or detrimental? i've always believed that two things will create whatever effectiveness you have in grappling. those are your skillset and your attributes. and the best athletes are those who excel in both. don't kid yourself. if someone gets twice as strong by some kind of magic potion, they're going to be a more effective grappler. if someone gets twice the level of endurance that they had previously, they will be a more effective grappler. these physical attributes have a very important outcome on the... sorry, a very important effect upon the outcome of matches. it's always a good thing to be stronger. it's always a good thing to have better endurance. it's always a good thing to have better balance or whatever other attribute you throw out there. gordon's point was, okay, everyone agrees on that, but there's a problem. in order to build these things, you have to carve into other elements of your training regimen. and then it becomes, well, which becomes more important, increases in strength or increases in skill? there comes a point where investing in strength training starts to get diminishing returns. i can't tell the difference between someone who bench presses 300 pounds on the mat versus someone who bench presses 400 pounds. but that's a big difference. that's a hundred pound difference. and for an athlete to go from bench pressing 300 pounds to 400 pounds, that would require a great deal of training, effort, and focus. but if i can't tell the difference when i grapple, then why bother? okay, why bother? okay, once you get to a certain strength level, it doesn't really help that much to go from a 400 pound bench press to a 450 pound bench press. that's the stage where you're really getting a diminishing in returns on your training investment. now skills, on the other hand, experience far, far less in terms of diminishing returns. every new skill you develop can translate very, very well into big increases in performance. look at the example of gary tonan that we talked about earlier. investments in guillotine made a significant improvement in his effectiveness in matches and led directly to some of his most important victories. but if he had invested the same amount of training time in developing a bench press that was 25 pounds more than previously, that would have had no influence on the outcome of those matches. so the question always becomes yep, everyone acknowledges that these physical attributes are important and everyone understands that becoming stronger or fitter is a desirable thing and every athlete should work on them. the interesting question becomes, okay, at what point do you start to say, i'm not going to be helped by further increases in strength training or endurance training? and my point with my athletes is in the overwhelming majority of cases, if there's any kind of doubt, invest more heavily in skill training than attribute training, especially once you get to a certain level on the attributes. well, the interesting thing that i think you should account for with strength training is there's instagram, there's the world, it seems to be more fun to build muscle mass. it's an addiction that people have. there's also economic elements too, most people, i hate to say this, but it's true. most people are more concerned with image than function and it's hard to sell a fighter or a jiu-jitsu athlete who doesn't look one. looks fedor. yeah, it's a tough sell. now you can do it in fighting and jiu-jitsu because ultimately it's about whose hand is raised at the end of the match and you could even use it as a selling point. you can be a guy that doesn't look he should be winning, but he is winning. that is a selling point. but if you give most people a choice between looking arnold schwarzenegger and winning matches versus looking fedor and winning matches, most people will select, i wish i'd rather look arnold schwarzenegger. and so most athletes feel almost an economic compulsion to be in good shape and in order to advance their marketability. yeah, nike is not going to sponsor fedor or tank abbott. yeah, tank abbott, no. fedor maybe. but yeah, we need at the very top. there's something about aesthetic, image of strength and power. it's also a personal thing. if you look at yourself in the mirror, do you what you see? you know what i mean? yeah. do you find yourself attractive? what can you do to make you look better? to me, it was something. one of the reasons i work out is also for that. well, i'm sure if fedor looks in the mirror, he says, i look damn good today. yeah, you could be too. it's also a genetic factor. some people, it's harder for them. i mean, yeah. all right. so the question on training, you guys, john gordon train often three times a day, every day. georgia had a different approach to training. i don't mean that in the opposite or something. it's just not every single day. and obviously, you are legitimately at the very top in terms of performance accomplishment in the field. so what have you learned about what it takes to train to become not just the lead, but the best? a lot of people, when you say train, they see training hard. i believe you need to be very constant and very disciplined. you need to train, but you don't need to train hard every day. that's what john taught me. for me, the nervous system, sometimes i feel if i load it up too much, it comes to a point that it's too much. there is no more information that i can absorb. and i do believe that it's something that you can train to your capacity of being able to learn, of absorbing certain things. and i did a lot of volume of training, but when i was getting ready for a fight, especially during sparring day, i to do it quick because when i fight, it's five rounds of five minutes. i don't to spend an hour or two hours in a gym because i need to know how hard i can be going for 25 minutes. not for two hours, for 25 minutes. and in my last fight, john and i, we were thinking of how could we make me more of a better finisher, more opportunist. and john, i remember when we were training with gordon, jake schill came, gary tonon, my round of grappling were different than if i would be training for abu dhabi, for abi, or in grappling, the round are longer. but in a mixed martial arts fight, it's very rare that you're going to spend more than four minutes or four minutes and a half on the ground. it's very unlikely. it can happen. do you remember we did the round three minutes? all the rounds i was doing were three minutes rounds. so it gives a different rhythm to the training. it forced me to be more opportunist, to be more of a finisher because i had only three minutes to do what i needed to do. so if i say something, i need to go for the kill right away. i cannot be too over-patient. and it served me well in my last fight. and i think that's a good blueprint to follow when you're a mixed martial art fighter. the result was great. and i think maybe i should have done that before. it was a great idea that we had. not to be very careful on doing too much volume. yes. try to get out and then try to focus on finishing and getting out as quickly as possible. to build up your foundation, i believe you need a lot of volume. but when you get ready for competition, it needs to be something that replicates what you're going to be facing. what are we talking about? what do you think? is there rest days, five days a week, twice a day, once a day? is there any one formula that? i don't know. i do not believe in overtraining. i believe in under-rest. i believe you can be under-rest. and people always link that immediately to the volume of how much volume they train, which could be something else. how are you feeling emotionally? are you having problems, personal problems? do you have a hard time sleeping because you have someone died? you hold money, you're broke. it could be anything. there's something that can affect you psychologically or emotionally that made it in a way that you cannot sleep well because your stress, your cortisol level is high. all these factors need to be taken into consideration. it's not only about the volume of training. people always think the training is not the only thing that can affect recuperation, which it is not. you have to minimize the amount of stress from all kinds of factors. it's a very stressful job to be a professional combat athlete, whether you're a grappler, a boxer, a kickboxer, a fighter, and you need to be taking into account. is it more or less stressful than marriage? just kidding. next question. i don't know how to ask this question given what george just said, but you're training three times a day and finishing. what have you learned about what brings out the best in you as the elite level grappler? over the recent years, i've actually changed it up a little bit. when i was coming up from white to black belt, i felt that the volume was the most important. it would be anywhere from three to seven sessions a day, going from school to school, from new york to new jersey. i think that the volume was very important to build the skills, where i just didn't know how to move my body at purple belt the way that i should. i think that building the skills is super important. i think that early on, volume is very important. now that i already have the skills built, i think that acquiring more knowledge is the most important. i find that if i do so many sessions a day, if i do three sessions a day, i feel sometimes by the third session, i'm just so mentally, there's so much information that's went through my head the first two sessions that i feel i'm not even there mentally on the third session. i feel doing less volume now, but having more mental clarity per session is more important because i already have the foundational skills acquired. a lot of your training is almost just thinking, learning. a lot of it, yeah. our schedule has been messed up since the pandemic because henzo's got shut down and they were using a french gym in puerto rico and now we're using a french gym in austin. but once we have our own school, we'll have a setup schedule where i can pretty much just be there all day long. but right now, i do a lifting session in the morning and then i'll come in and help teach at henzo's. so i'm there mentally, i'm seeing what's going on and i'm playing around with ideas in my head. and then i'm there physically and very sharp mentally for the competition class during the 1pm session. and then after that, i'll go home, i'll rest and get ready for the next day. what have you learned john, seeing all these different athletes? is there a universal rule that applies or is it athlete specific? yeah. first, one thing that needs to be addressed is that george and gordon play very different sports with very different athletic demands. gordon can be in matches that range from anywhere from six minutes to literally hours long. as a result, the overall pacing and intensity of matches is massively different. most obviously, there is no striking in gordon's sport. striking by its very nature is a much more explosive physical action than grappling. grappling is primarily an isometric kind of sport based around isometric tension and endurance. george's sport does feature a significant amount of isometric tension, but the majority of it is based around explosion. so the physical demands of the two sports are radically different. in addition, the time of application is radically different. george raised a very interesting point. his matches seem long, 25 minutes for a championship match. but always understand that a mixed martial arts fight at championship level, if it goes the distance, is really five, five minute matches. each round is a match in itself, and that's exactly how you're scored. you're scored by who wins the most matches over five matches. as a result, the application of the techniques, especially the grappling techniques, has to be done at a certain pace. as george pointed out, realistically, the maximum application time you're going to get in most situations is somewhere between 15 seconds and three minutes. even for a specialized grappler damien meyer, there's still a significant part of each round, which is spent in set up time to actually get the match to the ground. it's very likely that at some point your opponent will stand up out of grappling and you'll have to re-initiate the entire process again. so that even for specialized grapplers, you might be spending only three minutes out of a five minute round on the ground. as a result, you've got to get your work done in a very short timeframe. gordon ryan, once it goes to the ground, and it can go to the ground because he chooses to sit to the ground, may spend the entire match in ground positions. as a result, the matches have completely different pacing and completely different physical demands. the preparation that the two athletes go through will reflect that. if george st. pierre, in training for mixed martial arts, becomes fatigued to a point where he's no longer physically effective and able to defend himself, the consequences for that in mma training can be very deep and deep. if you make a mistake in mixed martial arts because you're fatigued and tired, and you take a full power roundhouse kick to the head, that's some deep consequences. a grappler doesn't have to face that. you can be completely exhausted in grappling and just sit in the bottom of the mountain, just practice just survival skills where you just don't get submitted from bottom out. and that can still be an effective training session. complete and utter physical breakdown of fatigue can end an athlete's career in mixed martial arts. the consequences of training through fatigue and mma are potentially very deep and very disturbing. the consequences of training through complete physical exhaustion and grappling aren't really that severe. okay, you just tap. whenever there's a problem, just tap. and so they're very, very different sports in the way you prepare for them. in a grappling athlete gordon ryan, we can take many more liberties with physical exhaustion and the amount of hours a day you spend in training than you could with a mixed martial arts athlete jackson. it could actually be a benefit, exhaustion as a framework of learning. so from a place of exhaustion, is there any benefit? you said being at the bottom of the mountain, understanding jiu-jitsu, grappling somehow deeper because you're physically exhausted. absolutely. because then the only thing you have left in your favor is your technique. and then you'll see how technical you are. in addition, you'll get to explore realms inside your mind that we don't spend a lot of time in. and you'll learn a lot about yourself and your ability to endure, which will have potentially great benefits in similar situations and matches. yeah, there's, i mean, for me, for a recreational person, getting exhaustion allows you the great benefit to experience what it feels to really get dominated at an even greater frequency than you otherwise would. and there's something there, there's some animalistic thing that's very unpleasant. and then afterwards it takes you to a place of humility and it forces you to rethink life in positive ways. there's something about dominance. i mean, if you get dominated a few times, you can rationalize it somehow. you say, okay, well, i screwed this up. but when you're exhausted and you have to do 30 minutes or 40 minutes or an hour of just being dominant over and over and over being submitted, it, i don't know, it's a very good process for other avenues of life. i find i can't explain why, because i'm driving home crying afterwards listening to bruce springsteen. but afterwards, this afterwards, somehow you can think clearer, you can see clear about what is the right path through life in all walks of life, relationships, work, but also the grappling. actually, the grappling is the hardest one to see what you have to do. that it clarifies other avenues, the humility, it removes the bullshit. it's we see the world through some kind of fog and it just removes it. and now you can see things clearly. i don't know what that is. i think, i think it's important. like you mentioned to push yourself something to see how far you can go, because sometimes you can go further than than what you think. and it can boost your confidence. you know, you can push yourself through a certain limit and maybe you thought your limit was before that point and you pushed through it. but john just mentioned, it's a risky thing to do in striking because if you're exhausted, you're going to get brain damage. in grappling, it's, you know, you tap if something wrong, but you can do it also in strength conditioning. i to run track. i do it all the time and track and fill. it helps me to know myself better. i think it's important. it's a good point. it's the scrimmage wrestling rounds we do. it's , you know, if you stop moving that you're going to get scored on and you know in your mind, there's no mechanical reason why i should give up a score here, but you're so exhausted that you're , man, this is terrible. if i stop moving, i'm a pussy. if i don't stop moving, i'm going to be twice as exhausted when we actually do stand up. so it's an interesting game you have to play inside your mind. it's your pride very often that keep you sharp, you know what i mean? because you just want to lay down and beat it because you're completely exhausted. what do you think is the connection, john, between this ego pride thing, martial arts and actual violence with our ancestors? you ever plug into that? you think there's echoes of something going on there? you mentioned you have flaws and demons. is it deep in there somewhere? do you think we're struggling with those demons? yeah. you'll need to patch up your question a little bit though. it's going to save you different donations. wow. not only am i dominating in jiu-jitsu, i'm dominating in interviewing. no, no, no. i'm not patching up that question. i'm just at a scene where they're , okay, now we interview you. but you went down the evolutionary... bob lazar, what do you think? i don't mean just the line between what is martial arts and what is violence. there seems to be a gray area that connects us to the evolutionary ancestors. absolutely. yeah. i think there's a deep recognition in all of us that... and the evidence for this is so easy to see in daily life. if you're walking down the street and suddenly you hear a commotion and two people are fighting, you will see literally everyone on that street stop whatever they're doing and watch the fight. humans are fascinated by violence and you've got to ask yourself why. and of course, it's a recognition that for a significant part of our evolutionary history, violence was one of the most important elements in human existence. as much as we curse it, as much as we talk badly of it, the juxtaposition between humans' social nature and their need for each other to get along and to express love amongst the various members of a given community, there are disputes between humans that can't be resolved. and ultimately, throughout history, violence has been the number one method of conflict resolution for better or for worse. and there's a recognition in all of us that this is where we come from. and there's a reason why combat sports have this thing where people will watch them and they might even be able to see them, people will watch them and they might even be repulsed by them, but they find it difficult to take their eyes from it. and i do believe that most combat athletes carry that sense of their, even if it's on a subconscious level, this kind of belief that this is who we are. george, you used the word pride and i believe that's a big part of it. i believe that most humans have this sense of self-worth and pride, which they're willing to fight for. and if it gets crossed by someone else, they're willing to stand. some people will stand more early and some people will be pushed further back, but everyone's got that line beyond which they won't be pushed. and there's some kind of deep recognition in all of us that we have that somewhere within us, no matter how hard we try to bury it or what have you. and that's why i believe there will always be this eternal interest in combat sports. now, i don't believe that most people today have any kind of respect for unrestricted violence or non-consensual violence. i think most people, most good people are repulsed by that. and i'm sure that as humanity improves out into the future, that will become more and more widespread. but that's not to say we can't exercise these old evolutionary demons inside of us. and sometimes there are just disputes between different people, different cultures, different nations where ultimately it's going to come into a shoving match and that will degenerate further into violence. there's always going to be a need for humans to be able to express themselves through violent methods and to use physical force to get to their goals and objectives. our need as humans is always to find a balance between the two forces of conflict and cooperation. we need cooperation because humans isolated from each other are more or less helpless and useless. in order to advance, human communities need to build and grow. and so that sense of cooperation occurs in most of our daily lives. but there will also be irresolvable conflicts where physical force has to be used to form a resolution. and so most human beings find themselves swinging a pendulum between conflict and cooperation. and that is something which really gives birth, i think, to combat sports. because, sorry. i really have to ask you about this then. there's a guy in harvard named richard wrangham. and there's a lot of people that believe this. he wrote this book that basically there's a lot of people studying what happened. how do we get from apes to humans? what was the magic thing? a lot of people attribute it to fire and the ability to cook meat. there's a lot of different theories. so his theory, how do i describe this, is basically that the beta males won. that the apes that were able to cooperate. so the way you develop cooperation is that there's a big bad leader. the alpha male that you can only knock off their throne if you cooperate. and so we built big tribes that just excelled at cooperation by practicing the overthrowing the leader. and so anytime an alpha male would rise up, we would develop our skill further and further of cooperation. and so we're all just beta males, the descendants of beta males. that's his kind of theory that cooperation is fundamental and it's so distinct to the rest of the neighboring animal kingdom. fascinating. i wonder what you think about this tension of violence and cooperation. how important is this cooperation to the core of whoever's- if you look at it in a given training room, jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts is solo sports. a solo athlete steps into the cage or steps onto the mat. but all of your preparation is done in a cooperative training environment with many peers. and as much as it's an individual sport, all of your preparation is done as part of a group. there's a sense in which that's an interesting metaphor for humanity itself. everything we do in life, we do alone, but we grow up in this given community and what have you. with regards to the whole alpha male, beta male thing, humans are, it's true this fellow's correct. most primates do have very strongly defined alpha males who rule the roost and determine the entire direction of the community they build around themselves. humans on the other hand don't have an alpha male in that strict, strict, strict, strict, strict, strict, strict, strict, strict, strict biological sense of someone who's responsible for the next generation dominates all the female population, et cetera. yeah, physically dominates. but we do on the other hand have our own version of alpha males as far as we have political and sociological leaders who have a disproportionate impact on the direction of a community. was the cooperation allowed us to have a greater scale of hierarchy with the alpha male on top or the alpha creature on top? yeah, yeah. now that's a fascinating theory. in nature, we're very weak as a species, so we needed to cooperate in order to evolve. that i think made us at the top of the food chain. if you look at humanity in nature, really the two things that seem to more than anything else determine whether or not a given human community will be successful in a predatory world are numbers and technology. the more your numbers increase and the higher the technology of the weapons and support systems you have around you, the more successful you'll be in a predatory world. so it's not clear that just killing off the idea of an alpha male was the single biggest thing. the rise of technology and the growth of community after the imposition of language, these are other things that would have been very, very important factors in humanity's rise. george, you made an interesting point. if you look at humans, just the raw material of humans, we're fucking pathetic. in a predatory animal kingdom, we're just the absolute bottom of the food chain. we don't have a single effective weapon other than better than average endurance, that's about it. but you put us in a community who can talk to each other with language and give us the time to come up with technological advances such as metals. and suddenly a human will go from no combat effectiveness in the animal kingdom to a human armed with a simple metal tip spear can kill damn near any animal in the animal kingdom and working as a group. i'll beat your silverback, you know how? i'll fight him in a deep water pool because he cannot swim. so i don't have to touch him. you'll drown and i can't get him into the pool. you know why? because someone told me because i live in a community, someone told me that information. so i know he passed it on to me. yeah. he taught you. well, you have to convince him to, you have to somehow convince them to join you in the pool, which is very difficult. it's a very problem, very, very difficult. from a technical perspective, john, you've looked at mixed martial arts fighting in general and grappling. what's the difference between fighting and grappling? that's something i'd love to ask all of you. maybe john, you can start , well, when you talk about fighting, you mean unrestricted mma type fighting. yeah. it's funny. you said unrestricted mma type fighting, mma type fighting. so there's street fighting, there's mma fighting, and then there's grappling, purely the sport of grappling. you're saying, okay, what's the difference between mma and grappling? yes. okay. see, that would have been a much better question to ask. well, the single, when you talk about grappling, you're talking about jiu-jitsu rules. yeah. i mean, you could maybe also mention different rule sets that somehow fundamentally challenge, change the sport. in the sport of mixed martial arts, you've got two ways to inflict damage on the human body. you've got kinetic energy, which is done through striking, kicking knees, elbows, fists, and you've got isometric tension used along the lines of lever and fulcrum, which can be used for strangulation and joint breaking. in grappling, you lose one of those. you're no longer allowed to hurt your opponent with kinetic energy. you can do it accidentally through a throw, but you're not allowed to just knock someone out with a throw in most grappling sports. it can happen, but it's relatively rare and it's not encouraged by the rule set. a cyborg with a horn on. yeah. you got close. so there's a sense in which in mixed martial arts, you've got twice as many problems to deal with and they occur in a much shorter timeframe. the single biggest difference between grappling technique as a weapon in human combat versus striking technique is time. grappling technique takes a huge amount of time to apply. the great advantage of grappling technique is certainty of outcome. once you get there, it takes a huge amount of time to set up a takedown, physically take them down, work their way, work your way towards a dominant position, culminating in your opponent's back, and then apply a stranglehold. that's a long chain of events as opposed to a strong punch or kick, which can take quarter of a second and application from start to finish and the match is over. and so there's a sense in which grappling is fighting for the patient and the calculating, whereas striking is much more in this short timeframe where everything gets done in the blink of an eye. there's a sense also which grappling is a much more forgiving sport. you can make a terrible mistake, end up in a terrible position and still fight your way out and win. in mixed martial arts, it's much, much less forgiving. if you get hit and stunned, your chances of recovery are minimal. you're going to get swarmed on and unless it's right at the end of the round, it's very, very hard to recover from getting hit and swarmed on. so there's a sense in which the biggest difference between them is time of application of technique. in mixed martial arts, it's incredibly unforgiving in terms of time. even the smallest error can have the deepest consequences. in grappling, you can make massive errors and still come back and win. grappling will typically be won in a much higher percentage case by the more skilled and conditioned grappler, whereas there is much more of what they call a puncher's chance in mixed martial arts where there's a much higher likelihood of a lesser athlete defeating a greater athlete in mma than there is in grappling simply because of time of application of the techniques. even the smallest period of inattention in mma and the match is over. gordon ryan could fall asleep for 30 seconds, have his opponent mounted on him, wake up and finish him five minutes later. that's not going to happen in mma. okay. so the stakes are much higher. you can do a lot of damage in a very small amount of time and the just the dynamics, the temporal dynamics of how things happen is very different. everything you'll see will be a reflection of that. then you go further into things rule sets. in the sport of grappling, if gordon ryan comes out and sits down in the middle of the mat, his opponent must follow him to the ground and engage. in mixed martial arts, if you come to the center of the cage and sit down, the other guy can just walk away from you. they're completely oriented in different directions. grappling is ground centered. mma is typically standing centered. at the beginning of every round, you have to start standing again. if i disengage from a ground grappling situation, stand up and walk away from my opponent, my opponent must follow me up to the feet. in grappling, it's the exact opposite. if i sit to the ground, my opponent must follow me to the ground. it's written into the rule set. and so one is inherently ground oriented and one is inherently standing oriented. so it's more difficult to dictate where the fight happens in mixed martial arts. yes. you have to be able to impose where the fight happens. you have to be able to impose where the fight is. whereas in grappling, you can simply choose it. so george, what is your sense of the difference in terms of how you approached it between the two sports? you also are a student of wrestling and grappling. so in preparing for fights, what parts of grappling, purely the sport that you have to leave behind? well, i'm very lucky. i had the opportunity to train with, i consider the best mentor, trainer i ever had. and i have some of the best grapplers that i can train with. they were there to help me through my career. so for my training is, of course, because i do not dedicate as much time in one specific area, it's hard to be a world class athlete in only one particular area. i always, for me, the idea to be more well rounded, to be very competent in every of those areas, striking, grappling, takedowns, and all those areas. then being just very good at one and not as good at others. because i the idea that it gives me more option when i fight someone, i can mold myself to become the perfect nemesis to that person better if i'm more well rounded. if i do not have those well rounded skill, i don't have that option. you have less tools to work with, less technology. what about you, gordon? what do you think is very distinct about grappling and the way you approach it versus fighting? i think most of it was covered. but i think that one of the big things is the fact that when you're looking at mma, you have a pretty general agreed upon and unified rule set. where if you look at ufc versus bellator, they have slight differences in the rules maybe. but it's pretty much the same thing. whereas in grappling, you have ebi rules, then you have adcc rules, you have ibjjf rules, you have no time limit rules. and each rule set will play to the skills of different athletes. if you do adcc rules, it generally is slightly biased towards wrestlers. or if they can stall to the overtime and then hit a takedown in the overtime and not really doing any jiu-jitsu, but they score a takedown, they're going to win. whereas if you have an ebi, for example, you have to finish the guy in regulation or you start in a jiu-jitsu position with your back taken or in an arm bar. so i think that you have certain rule sets that play in the favor of certain athletes. and certain athletes can win in one rule set, but then they just have no chance of winning in the other. like when i fought yuri the first time in ebi, i beat him in ebi. the chances of me beating him on that night under an a-level rule set, under an adcc rule set were probably pretty low. when i fought leandro lowe under an adcc rule set, he beat me that day, but the chances of him beating me on the same day in an ebi rule set were next to zero. so i think it's interesting that in mma, you have one unified rule set, which have small differences, but they're all generally the same. and in jiu-jitsu, you have a wide variety of different rule sets that have biases towards certain athletes' skill sets. you mentioned leandro lowe. i got to ask you again about adcc. you have lost very, very few times in your career. one, i mean, the same is true for george. and the only person who has ever submitted you is philippe peña. a black belt, yeah. a black belt. he is adcc world champion, multiple time ibjjf, guianogi world champion. you may face him at adcc or elsewhere in the future. will you beat him? yes. i mean, i have to say yes, right? but i fought him initially when i first got my black belt, then i fought him a year later, so 2016 and 2017. and despite what people remember about the match, and whenever people talk about it, it's , yeah, the guy who strangled gordon. but no one remembers that the first match was a 45-minute war. and then the second match with the full 20 minutes of adcc. and if i didn't get my back taken in the last minute and a half, two minutes, it would have went into an overtime. and that could have changed the outcome of the match. i think that if you look at philippe's performances, especially nogi, specifically nogi since then, it looks he's almost gotten worse. whereas since that match in 2017, the only match i lost after that was against vinny magalache by points. and i'm on a 55-match win streak over the course of four years, winning all the major tournaments nogi. and philippe, since that match, i think is five and two nogi. and he's lost his last two matches. one was convincingly where he was dominated by andre and one was by submission. so i don't think that he's progressed nearly as fast. if anything, he looks he's worse than he was when he beat me in 2017 based on his previous performances. that being said, i know he's going to come in training very hard for this one and he's going to be prepared. but i just don't think that in terms of technical ability, he's anywhere near my level. and he was much bigger than me both times we fought. the first time he was much bigger than me. the second time he was one way class above me. so now there's not going to be an advantage in technicality and there's also not going to be a physicality advantage. so i think he's just going to be beat everywhere. this is a good example of the scientific response to a comment, to a question. yeah, so he's not, that's a match you're not deeply concerned with in terms of the set of opponents because you have and you will be facing a lot of really difficult. that's actually, in my opinion, one of the easier matches because of the fact that we're relatively the same size. and i think that's the biggest difference. if i show up at 230 pounds, a lot of the guys are 260, 270 plus. so that extra weight doesn't make a difference. i think out of that entire bracket, felipe is probably going to be the one of the easiest matches because of the fact that i can easily take him down. and if i take him down, i'm going to pass his guard. whereas i feel the other guys, because they're so much bigger and they're very cagey, it may take me a while to actually take them to the ground and get on top of them. and i think it may be, they may be longer drawn out matches because of the fact that they're so much bigger and stally, it's hard to take them down. but felipe is relatively my size and as wrestling is atrocious. so i've already taken them down in the last adcc match. so i'm pretty sure i can just easily put them down, pass them and then finish them. well, i'm not sure what response i was expecting, but that was phrased beautifully. we talked about the tiago alves fight that george had and john barred up in class yesterday, i believe. but the point is we're talking about wrestling and i think that that's a fascinating fight that there's an incredible display of strategy, of skill, of heart. george, could you maybe talk about that fight, john, maybe too? what lessons you gained from that fight? go ahead. it was your fight, not mine. well, maybe it also tell what happened in terms of your injury, i think third round. oh yeah. so i was fighting tiago alves and in the third round i tear my adductor muscle. it happened when i was on the bottom and i think he pushed my knee down, tried to pass my guard and i heard a pop. i don't know what- i think you were going for an arm bar. you were on his back, you switched to arm bar and he clipped the leg by pushing on your leg and you went in with a pre-existing injury and it tore. yes, and it got worse and i heard a pop. i don't know what it was, but i know it really hurt. so i came back standing up and there's a famous video that goes on the internet about when i go back in the corner and i tell my coach, i'm , i don't know what it is. i think i tore my adductor muscle and greg jackson is , i don't care, hit him with your groin. i was very worried because i wasn't pain, but i didn't know what i had. so i didn't know the gravity of it and it plays on your mind. but i had to bite down my mouthpiece and finish the fight. i knew i was ahead on the score card and i needed to finish strong. so what was your strategy there in terms of strikes, in terms of wrestling? so he's an exceptionally difficult opponent to take down. yeah. well, at first i knew i had a good jab, to stay always from the outside, fight him from the outside and use my footwork because he was a tank. he was much bigger and much stronger than me. i never wanted to stay in front of him. so he was all the way out or all the way in. and when i was coming all the way in, it was with my proactive or reactive takedown where i myself initiated the takedown by using a distraction a jab to make his end goes up. and then i go with a single or double leg or to react, baiting him for him to come hit me. and then while he's coming to hit me, i go change level and that's the way i to take my opponent down. some guys, for example, cabe, for example, he's very good at bringing his opponent to defense and use chain wrestling to take his opponent down. i find that for me, for myself, i specialize more into explosive takedown in the center of the octagon because i found it more economical for me. what did you see? you were commenting, john, about the wrestling. that was quite interesting. i mean, also, can you generally comment on the fact that george st. pierre, who don't, i don't think you wrestled. i started wrestling when i was 19 years old, but i wrestled some very good russian guys. so they took me underneath their wing. but my ability to cover distance comes from karate, does not come from wrestling. wrestling is how i finish. once i got the leg, how i finish the takedown. so the timing and the movement and the explosion required for this karate. i think an important distinction to make here is one which george made throughout his career. and i believe, george, you were the greatest innovator in mma history with regards to this. and this is the creation of what george calls shoot boxing, which is the amalgamation of striking technique, in george's case, mostly karate, because that was his martial arts background, into grappling, and in particular, takedowns. when most people say so-and-so has better wrestling in mixed martial arts, you have to be very careful what they mean by this. there are many highly credentialed wrestlers in the early days of mixed martial arts who went in and truly struggled to hit a takedown. now, these are very, very good wrestlers who in a wrestling match would easily put down their opponent. but in a striking situation where the ranges are completely different, and the setups are entirely different, the stances are different, even the overall conditions are different, you're no longer wearing shoes, people underestimate just what an impact it is for a wrestler to take the shoes off. you lose 20 of your forward drive the minute you take off the shoes. all of these make massive differences in whether or not you're going to be able to even make contact with an opponent for a takedown. as george pointed out, the true value of wrestling in mma is finishing the takedown once you've established contact, but that's only about 20 of the action of a mixed martial arts takedown. 80 of it is in understanding range, rhythm, setup, opportunity, etc., etc. and that's not part of wrestling at all. even the overall conditions are completely different. in the sport of wrestling, you start at very close range in a very bent over stance, and you're expected to wrestle in international styles for three minutes at a time. now suddenly, you're completely upright, and you're not wearing shoes. all the conditions, the rhythm and speed of it is different. the counters are completely different. it's just an entirely different animal. and so george was an early recognizer of this and started to put the emphasis on direct training for shoot boxing in addition to wrestling. so he practiced with very good wrestlers in the montreal wrestling club, just the sport of wrestling. and that's what made him very good at finishing takedowns. but it was in his shoot boxing training, which he himself largely developed. remember, george started at a time when mma was pretty damn young. and when you entered the sport of mixed martial arts, george, it wasn't even allowed on tv. it was completely banned. it was in his country. it was physically banned. they had to fight on indian reservations. and this is way back in the wild west days of mma. and so as a young developing athlete, he had to more or less do this by himself. if you ever want to hear some incredible stories, talk about teenage george st. pierre, he had a coach who used to make him put on boxing gloves. now, he was 16, 17 years old, and just put him on a hardwood floor against a professional boxer who was in his late 20s at the peak of his career. and he said, george, you're not allowed to punch. you just got to take him down while he tries to knock you out. and so he was a very, very good fighter. he was , you're going to adapt or you're going to die. literally. and he could have been very bad, but it turns out to be great. but there's a sense here in which people think, , you know, what determines your takedown ability in mma is your wrestling skill. your wrestling skill will determine your finishing ability on takedowns. but there's so much more to it than that. whenever people say, you know, what are the broad elements that determine the outcome of a mixed martial arts fight, okay, on the broadest possible level? and i always give the same three things. the athlete who can dominate the pace of the match, the athlete who can dominate the direction of the match, and the athlete who can dominate the setups will win the vast majority of fights they're in. those three things, the direction, the pace, and the setups. you dominate all three of those, you're going to win 90 of the matches you're in. george could always dominate the direction of the fight, because he could stop the other guy taking him down, and he could impose his own takedowns at any point in a match. so whether it went to ground or whether it stayed standing, it was a very, very good fight. whether it stayed standing was always up to him. george had the most sophisticated array of setups into takedowns that i've personally ever witnessed. the whole distinction between reactive and proactive takedowns came very early in george's career, and he excelled in both. most people tend to favor one or the other. most athletes have a very hard time imposing their setups on an opponent, and as a result, they have to use the cage as a crutch for their setups, where they just bully someone towards the cage and then put them down on the cage. george is one of the very few people who was equally good against the cage or in the open, and could do so in both proactive and reactive situations. the scary thing is that as good as all of you saw him look in the octagon, anyone who knows george as a coach will tell you he was twice as good as that in the gym, where he would often go against people several weight divisions above himself. i could sit here all day, i won't name names, but i always laugh when people say, , this is the greatest pound-for-pound guy of all time. and i've personally seen george take that guy down and crush him in the gym, and i can't say anything because it's rude to talk about that in public because it's just training. but i've seen george go with people all the way up to light heavyweights. some of the greatest names in the history of the sport, put them down, advanced position on the ground, and dominate them in training. it's what he did during that time. george, i got to say, i deeply admire many of the things i saw you do, not just in the octagon, but in training as well. the impact that you had on the degree to which takedowns were used in the sport was absolutely inspirational. that's why one of the reasons why i always say you're the only athlete i ever met who taught me more than i taught you, because you opened my eyes to a whole new world of shootboxing, and how i grew up in a time when i was laughing before when you talked about sugar ray leonard. i was a kid watching that match, and i grew up in a time where there was boxing, and there was kickboxing, and then i came to america and i learned grappling, and this young man here was the innovator when it came to the integration of the two. well, then i have to ask, because george sits here uncomfortably being complimented. if george st. pierre and khabib nurmagomedov face each other in their prime, who wins? that's a very, very loaded question. and how? what are the different trajectories you see? okay, how does each one win in your view? if one wins or the other one wins, what happens? interestingly, they're actually very similar in size, despite the fact that george fought at welterweight and khabib fought at lightweight. if you actually see them stand next to each other of similar height, khabib's actually a little more thick set. he's heavier than you. yeah, he's actually heavier than you walking around. george walked around most of his career between 188 and 191 pounds. and so khabib actually would ironically have a kind of size and strength advantage, despite being in the lighter weight division. that's been the general trend as mma has grown, is that athletes will come further down in weight to make weight divisions. i believe that george has the best takedowns in history in the open, in the cage. khabib, his great strength was using the fence to facilitate takedowns. khabib's other great strength was not only his ability to take people down, but to keep people down for extended periods of time. both of them were powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful, powerful. and so, they were powerful strikers on the ground and could do terrible damage to opponents on the floor. so they're both very similar in that regard. khabib was mostly a puncher from the back. george is mostly an elbow from the front. but both of them could lay waste to opponents with strikes on the floor. both of them were highly competent with submissions on the ground. they weren't submission specialists in the sense of someone gordon ryan, but they were certainly no slouches with submission holds. yeah, it's just a fascinating idea. so it's almost who gets the first takedown? yeah, i do believe that they could probably stand up on each other. i don't think either one of them would be able to hold the other down for a whole round. both of them are notoriously difficult people to hold down. so i don't think that whoever won the first takedown wins the match. i don't think it's that. i do believe that george would hold a decisive advantage in striking and distance management. the few times that khabib did look shaky is when he...khabib was either advancing forward menacingly, but when he had to fight moving backwards, there was a definite asymmetry between his ability to fight going forwards, which is very good, and his ability to fight going backwards, which was noticeably weaker. george would often fight both forwards and backwards. the thiago elvis fight, most of the standing time was going backwards. that's probably the single biggest difference between the two athletes in skill level would be in the standing position. on the ground, khabib, slight edge and takedowns on the fence. george, slight edge and takedowns in the center. ability to inflict damage on the floor, roughly equal. ability to fight off the back, roughly equal. ability to stand up from bottom, roughly equal. it's a very, very hard match. in terms of the biggest difference in skill level is going to be in the standing position. that doesn't necessarily mean that khabib would lose in the standing position. he might just push it to the fence and just use match tactics where he kept the fight on the fence for significant periods of time. you can win rounds in that fashion. it's a match that could go either way. both of them are absolutely the best that you'll ever see. i've always believed the three greatest mixed martial artists i've ever seen in my life were george st. pierre, khabib nirmangirav and john jones. the three of them have some interesting similarities and differences. all three beat every single person they ever faced. i know john jones officially has a loss by dq, but no one believes that was a loss. george does have two losses, but he defeated both athletes decisively in rematches. khabib did it by having no losses. interestingly, all three athletes have at least one match, which is controversial in terms of who won and who lost. john jones has had several matches which could have gone either way on the judges scorecard. khabib's match against glacier and thibault could have gone either way. george's match with hendrix could have gone either way. they all had matches that they won, which people would dispute the outcome. that was a similarity between the three of them. all three of them have had the ability to dominate the direction of fights. when they want it to go down, it goes down. when they don't want it to go down, it doesn't. that's why i put such a heavy emphasis on that idea that a mixed martial arts champion must be able to determine the direction of a fight. it's the single most important attribute that they all must have. as to which of the three is the best, it's going to come down to criteria. you can't pull them apart. which answer you give as to which of those three is the greatest of all time will come down to the criteria that you use. is it being undefeated? is it the amount of time or is it the quality of the opponents that they had? if you do it by quality of opponents, i think you probably have to give it to george. if you do it by measured dominance through not being defeated, then it has to go to khabib. arguably, you could say the same with john jones since his one loss is by dq. but then you could also say the last three or four fights that john's had haven't been the same measure of dominance as we saw previously. ultimately, you've got those three guys in my opinion. which one you choose will come down to who it says more about who you are as a viewer than it does about the respective level of the athletes. you could throw a blanket over them. the three of them are just that good. the last three are the ones that you have to and which one you select will probably say more about who you are as a viewer than it does about them as athletes. i believe the best fighter, the goat, is not even born because the generation that is present benefit of a huge advantage. they have knowledge, technology that we didn't have before. we had the knowledge that the other generation did not have before. but i believe the goat is not even born yet. as good as they are today, i think in sport where you can measure the performance, track and field, olympic lifting, you know someone is better than the other one because you can measure the performance. fighting is all subjective. we always debate of who would win. but the tendency in sport is that the performance gets better. i don't think it's because the athletes necessarily get better. it's because they have access to better technology, knowledge and they learn from their predecessor. as long as that knowledge is transferred forward. something tells me that the greatest of all time lived a few thousand years ago and has forgotten some of the greatest warriors. can you imagine the kind of grapplers? the history didn't record them. there could have been small tribes where they developed mini-ufcs and they've developed the kind of things. you have to think of the gracies. just a small family was able to develop so much so quickly. i often have this discussion with john and i think it's very important to mention. i asked you several times what would happen if we would take a fighter of modern days facing the champion of pancreas. this is an interesting question. you brought some incredible good point and people don't realize it. i think one of the great tragedies of martial arts history is our loss of the historical records of pancreas. most of what we know is from what i'm told is actually lost in the fires of the library of alexandria. we're left with only a pitiful amount of information on pancreas and matches. what we do know is that there was a very large participation in the sport and that it was widely considered the most popular sport in the ancient olympics and that it was represented in the ancient olympics for many hundreds of years plus a long period of time before its introduction into the ancient olympics. the development time that it may have had would have been very significant. as far as we know, most of the development would have been in the major greek city states for literally hundreds of years of development. given its prestige as an olympic sport, then the best athletes would have been doing it. some of the sharpest minds that we know of in human history were involved in the sport. plato, the great philosopher, was a pancreasianist in his youth. in fact, his name, plato, is a nickname. plato is plate. it means broad or big guy, the big guy. he spoke often about pancreasian in his written works. imagine people with the intelligence of plato thinking about grappling technique for hundreds of years in the most popular olympic sport of that time. significant numbers of people with financial backing as city states put great prestige upon olympic success. they would have funneled athletes in, brought in the best coaches, and they had that for many hundreds of years. it's quite conceivable that the best pancreasian athletes were of the absolute first quality. it's so sad to think we'll never know what was their skill level. it's interesting to think about what kind of techniques they had developed, whether there's stuff we haven't discovered yet. in class, you were talking about the most effective takedown strategy in wrestling, in collegiate wrestling. let me ask first, because we offline talked about this too, what is the highest percentage submission in grappling? overall, you have to go with the rear naked strangles from the back. if you look at most tournaments and most rule sets, it has success across all rule sets, all weight divisions, all body types. it doesn't require any kind of specific physical advantage such as height in order to be effective. it works equally well in both fighting and grappling. it will work regardless of how physically and mentally tough your opponent is. a heel hook is a very high percentage technique in modern day competition. but if your opponent simply makes up his mind that he's not going to tap and is willing to take the physical damage, it won't result in the end of a match. a stranglehold by contrast will always end a match regardless of your opponent's mental toughness. i believe it's fair to say that at the end of the day, the single most high percentage method of submitting people in grappling is the rear naked strangles. so when you look at an athlete, maybe gordon, you can speak to this. what's the best submission to really invest in? is it the rear naked choke? to really invest in development, understanding the entirety of the system that leads into that? i think that you have to do them all, obviously. but if i had one submission that i would only one submission i could pick for the rest of my life, it would definitely be a rear naked. can you explain maybe some of the actual technical details of why that's the case? well, as john spoke about, they're different in joint locks, whereas you don't have to tap. you can just let your leg break and then keep going with the strangle. there's none of that. and then it's just an inherent advantage you have being behind someone. whereas if you go for an arm bar, you start from top mount and you're facing the guy, then you put him down and you're not directly behind them with leg locks, you're facing the guy. whereas when you're on someone's back, you have them in a pin where you can your chest to back, you have a body triangle and you're pinning the guy in place. he can't explode out. he can't grease his way out most of the time. and there's an inherent advantage you have being behind them due to the fact that we're poorly set up to deal with threats behind us. so would you say that's the most dominant position in jiu-jitsu? like more than mount, more than sack control? i think if you look at most matches historically, most guys who get stuck in positions for long amounts of time are guys that they're back taken. if you get an explosive guy from bottom mount, you can bridge and he can off-bounce you and lock half guard maybe and then work back to guard. but if someone locks a body triangle on your back, you can't do that. but if someone locks a body triangle on your back, that's where you see most guys getting pinned in place for long amounts of time. was the body triangle a well-understood thing? was that an invention at some point? like as a system, as a control position? perhaps some of your listeners can correct me on this, but i believe there was a technique banned in judo called do-ji-mei, which involved crossing feet or locking a triangle around the abdominals from the back. and it was banned in judo, i believe, because of intestinal injuries which occurred in the early developmental days of judo. and in the modern era, when i first began jiu-jitsu, body triangles were relatively rare. they were not a standard part of class. and sometime around the late 1990s, early 2000s, people started to realize, hey, this is a stronger method of control. it greatly increases the amount of control you have of your opponent's hips and torso over regular hooks. it's not for all athletes. it's difficult for most people who are of shorter, thicker statute to employ on big people. if your opponent is very broadly built through the stomach, it's almost impossible to apply. and so because it can't be applied by all people, it tends not to be taught much at beginner level. so as a result, it was always seen as a kind of a specialist move for taller athletes at a higher level of competition rather than a broad-based move for everyone or every body type in every class to employ. so it just didn't get emphasized that much. but in top-level competition now, i think you would see that it's very apparent that the vast majority of athletes, whenever they have the opportunity or a choice between body triangle and regular rear mounts, the majority of modern athletes would choose a body triangle. so we also had this conversation about wrestling. maybe, george, you can comment on what's the highest percentage, not statistically speaking. perhaps that's also interesting as john talked about, but just for you, in terms of mastery of a takedown, what's the best way to take it down a human being in wrestling? well, personally for me, it depends. for every fighter, they have a different set of skill. for me, when i look, someone want to bring down a tree, a big, strong, high tree, he cut it from the base. so the legs, that's what we stand on. so it was to attack the leg. but is it single leg, double leg? we talked about there's also the john smith low single, actually i don't even know if that's applicable for jiu jitsu at all. you can use it, but it runs into problems with submission holds. it's not impossible to use, but without shoes and in a situation where there's a whole plethora of submission holds and the scoring, it's a little more difficult to use. it is interesting, something being a high percentage in terms of effectiveness tells a story. you're saying that every athlete is different, but if it's more effective for most people, i mean, it's interesting. it's interesting what john talked about is that the highest percentage thing is actually in collegiate wrestling that he was talking about is on the defensive side. so blocking a takedown and spinning around to the back. so that's an interesting idea. then also there's all of these kind of going in for a single, then switching to a double or wizard position and doing knee tap. there's all these kinds of combinations that seem to be effective when you look at the statistics. it seems there's, maybe it's a scientific way of thinking, but it seems there is some conclusion to be drawn there. oh yeah. i believe you need to, the high percentage move, there's a reason why it works. i think it's made for a bigger amount of people. for example, one of my main strength, athletic strength is i'm an explosive person. so i'll use techniques that are explosive. if i got a single leg, one of my things i to do is to go for the double, power double. but for someone else, for example, in a single leg position, maybe he likes body throw better. he's more a greco guy or he's a judo guy. he's going to go for something else. but there is move that are, i would say, you just mentioned, are universal. statistically speaking, they're the highest percentage move that works for pretty much everybody. everybody pretty much can do an adhaka jimi. it's very easy, but it's not everybody that can lock a triangle with their legs. so those move a rear naked choke. adhaka jimi is the highest percentage move because it's maybe more accessible. it's accessible for a bigger range of people. yeah, based on the physical characteristics of the people. do you draw on your wisdom from these high percentages, john, for in terms of what to focus on? yeah, absolutely. jiu-jitsu has an ocean of moves, and you can get lost on that ocean. you can drift for a long period of time and that was very little to show for it. so my whole thing is focus. we only live one lifetime and your training lifetime is even shorter than your actual lifetime. so in that time, i put... unless you die on the mat. i put a very high value on choosing what i believe to be the most high percentage moves and putting an extraordinary amount of focus on them. the only problem is that in one generation, a move which can be considered low percentage might actually turn out to be high percentage in another generation. for example, we talked earlier about leg locks when i was first started jiu-jitsu, they were considered the ultimate low percentage move. and a big part of my career has been convincing people that in fact, that was incorrect, that they can be a high percentage move if we just change our approach to them. so we can't just follow tradition and say, , this is low percentage, this is high percentage. it has to be part of a fairly systematic study where you investigate what are the reasons why it's high percentage or low percentage. with regards to takedowns, if you look at what we can consider the most high percentage takedowns, if you're in front of someone, the single most high percentage way of taking them down is to get a hold of both of their legs and push them backwards. if you get a hold of one of their legs and put a force on them, they can use their other leg to defend themselves and hop around and funk their way out of takedowns and cause all kinds of problems for you. i don't care how athletic your opponent is, if you get a hold, a firm grip of both of his legs and start pushing him backwards, he's going to fall down to his butt. now he might be able to recover from there, but he will fall down. even easier than that is to be behind someone. takedowns from in front of someone are difficult. you go right into their hips, their head, their hands, you go into all their defensive weapons. if you're already behind someone and you're doing what in america they would refer to as a mat return, this is significantly easier than taking someone down from the front. if you have control of their head in a front headlock position, you've already closed distance on your opponent, you already have close contact, you don't have to worry about shooting anymore. there's no sprawl out of that. you don't have to worry about guillotines, kimoras or the standard defenses. those will intrinsically be easier takedowns out of front headlock. and so if we're going to talk about high percentage technique, i always go back to the mechanics of it rather than just historical tradition because historical tradition can be wrong. it was wrong about leg locks. it can be wrong about other things too. so my primary thing is, okay, talk to me about mechanics. that's what ultimately is going to determine whether something is high percentage or not. gordon pointed out earlier that when you're behind someone, you have innate physical advantages over the other guy. the human body is set up entirely to defend threats from the front. we are poorly adapted to defending threats from the rear. we don't have eyes in the back of our head. we can't apply pushing strength backwards. if you get behind someone, takedowns are 10 times easier from behind someone than they are when you're in front of someone. if you have to take someone down from the front, get a hold of both of their legs. if you can get a hold of both of their legs and a part of pushing force, you will almost always knock them down. if you can get a hold of their head and work takedowns from there, again, it's much easier because most of their defensive apparatus is being taken away from them before the takedown even begins. so for me, the most high percentage takedowns will always be from the front, double legs. any takedown from the back is going to be significantly easier than any takedown from the front. so all manner of mat return takedowns are going to be very high percentage. takedowns done out of situations where the opponent is broken down in front of you and you have either front headlock or front chest wrap position are going to be significantly easier than takedowns from the open. of course, you have to consider the full spectrum of mechanics involved here. it's possible that an outside low single leading to a double leg is a much higher percentage. there's a lot of chain wrestling that needs to be considered as a possibility. maybe a straight on double. and part of this cultural too, are people afraid of this kind of thing that they came to be the case with leg locks? are people aware of this? are they worried about this? are they training for this to defend this? and then it's opponent specific, of course, that with jordan barros, people are preparing for the double, which is why he had to develop a whole other kinds of different stuff. and then the head to all the different controls, all the different ties within the rule set. and that's where it's so fascinating to see the effect of rule set on all of this. judo over the past, i think 20 years went through this every olympics, different changes to the rule set, fundamentally different in terms of what's allowed to grip, whether you're allowed to touch the legs at all. that was a big one in 2012, i think. and that changes the sport completely. and so interesting. it's so interesting to watch how tiny change in the rule can change the sport. and it's so interesting to see how people are competing at the highest level. and the cool thing there is the rule change happens on a scale of every four years. so you get to see people that are at the top of their game have to recompute. so it's not you have a new generation of people coming up with the rules. they have to figure, , shit, you're not allowed to it's the equivalent of saying you're not allowed to kick anymore. never mind. because you not allowed to grab legs anymore in judo. interestingly, if you look at the case of judo, if you look at the world rankings of athletes, when they went through one of the most significant rule changes in judo history, where they banned any form of grabbing the legs, the ranking of athletes didn't change much. yeah, that tells you that there's a reason why those guys are at the top. yeah. and it doesn't have to do that they're specific to a rule set. think about that in terms of, imagine for example, in mixed martial arts, if they just said, hey, starting next week, instead of having three, five minute rounds, it's going to be 15 minutes straight. that would massively change the preparation of the athletes. it's a different game at that point. and judo literally was a different game before 2010 and after 2010. and yet, the international rankings didn't really change that much. the countries that were dominant before remain dominant. the athletes that remained before largely remain the same. you would think with such a massive change, all the rankings would have been thrown upside down, but they weren't. and again, it goes back to this idea that there's a reason why the guys at the top are at the top. and now for something completely different, we talked about aliens earlier. so, george brought up babazar. we'll likely probably talk to babazar on this podcast. and then john had a skeptical look on his face about aliens. so, let me ask john and gordon, do you think there's intelligent alien civilizations out there in the universe outside of our own? the universe is unimaginably large. the idea that we are the only life forms in a cosmos as large as this is, i think, naive and foolish. there's a very high likelihood that if life could evolve on this planet, that it could have done so on many, many other planets around the cosmos. i think anyone who puts even a moment's thought into this would realize that there's almost certainly other forms of life out there. the real question with regards to the alien community is have they got here and are they circling our planet in little silver sources and making observations and periodically stealing people for experimentation purposes? doesn't have to be silver sources, it could be different other color sources. and that question, i'm not at all convinced. recently, navy footage has come out showing some very interesting phenomena. if you talk to almost any experienced pilot, they will tell you they've seen things in the upper atmosphere that are very difficult to explain. i'll be the first one to agree with you on this. there are some things out there that are extremely difficult to explain. like literally ufos, unidentified final objects. yeah, i mean, we just don't know what they are. but to go from the idea that there's things out there that we don't understand to these little creatures running around and that these somehow exist, i just reserve judgment. i just say i'm agnostic about these things. i think it's possible, but all the evidence that i've been showing so far was insufficient to come to any kind of definite conclusions until aliens land in central park on tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m. and get out with little alien ray guns and start shooting people, i don't believe in many of the stories that get told. well, what about if it's not little aliens with ray guns, but something very different, very, very difficult to detect for us humans, us very human-centric creatures? well, then at that point, it's a fascinating idea and it's certainly possible, but show me the evidence. all right, what about you, gordon? do you look at the cosmos and ponder the stars often? i think it's fair points john raised. something really interesting i saw the other day was someone posted , if an alien or civilization 65 million light years away somehow managed to look at earth, they would theoretically see the dinosaurs because they're 65 million light years away. so imagine us looking at galaxies that are 100 million light years away. that's 100 million years ago. you have no idea what it looks now. so that's super interesting to me about it. yeah, the expanse is huge and so much cool stuff could be going out there. yeah. the scary thing of course is if they haven't visited us yet, there has to be a good reason for it. and the set of scary reasons of all the fact that they maybe once it gets sufficiently advanced in your development, you destroy yourself naturally as humans seem to be approaching now. we more and more have the tools to destroy ourselves completely in terms of our weapon systems. and we're developing them more and more and they're becoming better and better. and then we're starting to get angry and anger on twitter and instagram at each other. those are good points you're raising. a story has taught us that everything that lives one day will die. so we will perish. one day, yeah. there's also just the sheer difficulty of travel through space. like space is an unimaginably inhospitable environment. and to the best of our knowledge, even the theoretical speeds that we can attain in space, even if we could travel at the speed of light, we're not even remotely close to that. still the distances that need to be traveled to get to even relatively close solar systems are very, very long. if you look at the distance that we're traveling, if you look at astronauts who have spent significant amounts of time in space just orbiting the earth, it has severe health effects on them. we're just not built for space. we're supposed to be in a gravitational environment. by we, you're referring to your biological meat bag that's containing the essence of the mind that is john donahue. maybe we can transfer the mind alone. so the bag, the meat bag is not designed for space, but maybe the contents of the mind is. but again, this is all, it's possible, but it's concrete evidence. you folks who difficult things, what do you think about elon musk going to colonize mars? is this something you find an interesting or a aimless pursuit? i think it's a must or a salvation. we need to leave at some point the planet because historically in the past, we know that we've been bombarded by asteroid, volcano. there are crazy things happen here. it's very unstable. if you look at it through a lifetime of a human being, it's nothing but just look 12,000 years ago, what happened. so there is cataclysm that happened all the time. it's very unstable. so if we want to survive as a species, i think we need to be able to get out and spread our seed. so these are the early steps on a really long journey, but is there something about , we don't get that exploration from most of modern society. the kind of exploring that people did throughout the centuries of coming to north america just throughout, we were shrouded in physical uncertainty of what's out there. and now we get to do the same kind of exploration with mars. so i mean, is there any aspect of you that wants to travel out to space, that wants to travel to mars? the goal is to allow civilians to travel perhaps in our lifetime, meaning affordably. you can do so now unaffordably. traveling to space and traveling to mars are two different things. i think i would to travel into space. i don't know if i would to travel all the way to mars. because of the risks involved? just because. boring. is there some part of you that enjoys the unknown? i think that if i was towards the end of my life, i would to travel to mars. just for the experience. yeah. but if i go to mars, i'm not coming back. i think that's it. one way ticket. maybe with the technology we have now, maybe in the future, maybe the children of our children will be able to experience that to go to the weekend on mars. well, the whole design of the starship that spacex is working on is supposed to come back. it's supposed to be reusable. so it's not a one-way ticket. that's the whole point. it's always going back and forth, back and forth. what's the time frame between two planets to travel from? i think the current thing would be stuck on mars for two years. but how long does it take to get from earth to mars? oh, it's pretty, i'm not exactly sure, but it's pretty quick. it's pretty quick. like, i don't know, on the scale of months, not scale of years. you might not be healthy when you come back. you know, all the astronauts, they experience health issues. they lose a lot of muscle mass, bone density. so i don't think the technology is good right now. i mean, let's say that... if it is, i would love to be doing it for a weekend. if it's safe, i would love to be the first one to... well, you're also somebody who's a professional fighter who sacrifices his body for something. so there's some sacrifice we do in life, right? i don't want to be the first. i wouldn't want to. i leave the other one, but when i know it's safe, okay, count me in. so one of the things that people say, and this is something i wonder about, is it's having children or something. once you see, once you're out in space and you look out and you see earth, you look back at earth, that's an experience that's unlike anything else. like you can't replicate it here. it's to look back at that blue dot. and that... really nerve wracking. oh shit, where are i? you see earth disappear into the distance. yeah, yeah, disappear into the distance. and then you get to actually stand on mars and see, and just to look, you're standing on the ground and you're looking out and you see the planet from which you came and where you might not be coming back. but there's a challenge to the whole thing, whereas the risk is tremendous. and i don't know, i find that risk really compelling for some reason, but that could be just the exploration. i guess that's a genetic thing too, how much do you want to explore? there's a sense though in which, even in the best case scenario, where they did get the technology to whisk you to mars in a fairly short period of time, it's kind of an inauthentic sense of exploration because your participation in it is no more exciting than your participation in an airline flight to a foreign country. you basically, you didn't have anything to do with the creation of the vessel. you're not in command of the vessel. you're not in any way, shape or form important to the mission. you're just a person sitting in a passenger seat and you get off in a destination the same way you would if you flew to singapore or london or someplace that. well, there's a hierarchy of there's a leadership and then there's a bunch of people and they all have roles. you don't get to go to mars without having some skill set to contribute. but you made it sound space tourism where you just pay a ticket. i think it's a long time before you have space tourism to mars where you have nothing to contribute. what do you do? you go through a training program? training program and then there's technical things you'll be contributing. so that would bring people in terms of agriculture. i don't know. okay. so this is better. this sounds they're more explorers. if you talked before about explorers and human history where magellan sets off on his boat and every person on the boat had a specific function. they were all into the mission in a very authentic fashion. if they weren't on the boat, the performance of the crew would somehow suffer. so this sounds much better. and with just with magellan, i think most of the crew died. a significant number did, yeah. and from bacteria, i mean from things that are unexpected and so on. and if we discover life on mars, i mean who knows what that entails? because that's a manned mission to mars would likely be very driven by the research to do all the kind of exploration required to find life. now from mr. musk's point of view as a developer, presumably there has to be some kind of financial incentive here too. is there some kind of financial benefit to mars missions? presumably there wouldn't be that many people on earth that could afford a ticket to pay for the kind of research and development that would require this. is there some kind of mining on mars of minerals that would be useful? i think there's a lot of answers to this, but the only honest answer is the one that looks back into human history where we did a lot of things just because we could. a lot of hard things just because we could and that led to a lot of innovation that ultimately made our life better. so this is more, this is why you have nasa, this is why you have government organizations. like what's the purpose of nasa? nasa would answer that by saying, okay, well we're helping launch satellites up there. they'll have a bunch of answers, but the reality is the programs were funded in large part by our desire to explore the unknown. and there's some aspect to which we have to all invest into that because historically speaking that has produced a lot of cool things along the way that were totally unexpected. but nasa is funded by public funding, the taxpayer. how is mr. musk going to fund this? well currently most of the funding with spacex is nasa giving money to, so they're making a competition. who can get our satellites? we need to go to, you know, it was for the space station to resupply the space station or we need to launch satellites up. who's going to carry those quote unquote payloads? they just need, so nasa is paying whoever the heck wants to get kilograms of thing up into space. this is nasa's specialty, why did they just give up on that? well they realized when mr. musk came along and then bezos and others that said we can do it for one-tenth the price. so why should the taxpayers pay for that? why don't you nasa do what you do well, which is test out cutting edge stuff, make sure they're safe. and now that we've developed a car, let us ups and fedex take care of doing this at scale, doing it cheaper, doing it better. i mean that's the argument. and nasa took, what they realized is it took way, way too long to do stuff. when you're investing millions, sometimes billions of dollars into a project, the bureaucracy builds up and the conservatism builds up to where you're, i mean you really have to test everything out. so projects take years and then you have somebody elon musk coming along and says, well let's do launches every week and as opposed to just throwing away the rocket, we'll reuse the rocket. that was one of the sort of cutting edge inventions. it's a dumb obvious idea. like elon says, why do you throw away the plane? it's the equivalent as if you flew a plane every time you threw it away. why are we every time throwing away the plane? but nasa tried that kind of thing with the space shuttle since the 1970s. yes, well they did that with the space shuttle, but not at the scale here. that was the space shuttle was seen as this majestic, amazing thing that requires a huge amount of investment. well, elon musk is , no, every basic rocket should be reusable. cut cost, cut cost. do you think the more technology we have, the more advanced we become, the more advanced we become, the more specialized we need to be? like is that for that reason that now there is different branch? like you just explained now nasa they're specialized in this, but they left other branch. yeah, there's greater and greater specializations. we build up more stuff, which is fascinating because... is it making us more dumb in a way? do you think ... like i don't know. i use a cell phone, but i don't know how to build it up from... i mean, it's that beta males building up this whole society because we're this collective intelligence. we rely on each other more and more. and i do also see sort of the rise of conspiracy theories and all those kinds of things because i've been talking to a few folks about flat earth recently. it's fascinating. it's fascinating. there's a large community of people that believe the earth is flat and that idea takes hold in this day and age of all the ideas. that's the one that takes hold for a large number of people. and i think that's a consequence is this kind of specialization where it's just huge amount of experts. but if you look out into our world and try to reason simply about our existence, we are losing the skills to do that because more and more people are specialized as opposed to general thinkers. we're extremely good at specific things. are we capable now to do a robot that is self-aware? that's one, the legged one. it's self-aware. it's not self-aware. it's been listening, but it's not self-aware currently. but do you think a human being is self-aware? that's a good question. i mean, i ask this question all the time. when the robots move, there's a sense of when they turn on, something entered that robot. wow. and when it turns off, something left. if they move in a certain kind of way and if they surprise you, there's certain elements that enable us to see the magic in a living being. and some of them, i mean, we can maybe list them, but it's the ability to surprise you. it's the ability to make mistakes and learn from them visibly. there's a bunch of things that you just, i don't know, it just feels it has the magic of what is a living being, which is what humans have. and i try to think about how do you replicate that into a machine. so when you turn it on enough, you feel it dies every time and it reborn. so for most machines, we don't feel that way. when we unplug things, we don't feel that way. i don't know why we don't feel that way. that's an interesting question. but i think when the robot has certain qualities memory, ability to recognize you, yeah, you start to feel you're turning off an organism. so whenever i have the robots that recognize me and remember this is important, all the things we've experienced together, then it's , holy shit, that's a living thing. but does he remember? it feels a living thing. does he remember your robot? does he remember things that happened before you unplugged him? is it he's sleeping? like he wake up or is he dead? so right now we start to zero everything. no, it doesn't start at zero. it remembers everything. that's the key. every time you unplug, wow. it's storing the memory. but the memories are basic. they're , okay, we walked around the kitchen and then you looked at me. i mean, the memories, it's data. it's not we've experienced, it's able to actually experience anything deep we humans can. but just the fact of memory. it's the toaster or the microwave don't give a shit about me. they don't know me. they don't know me by name. they wouldn't recognize my face as being different from gordon's. they wouldn't know the difference. and they wouldn't remember the microwave currently. doesn't remember the times i've been sad or happy, what food i put into it. it doesn't remember this when i was being a fat ass or when i was being in good shape. and just those memories are enough to make you feel when you turn a thing off. that's , shit, that's a living thing disappearing. of course, that's kind of an anthropomorphism we do to each other. but that's something. that makes me believe it's possible to create systems which we can have a connection that are non-human, similar to dogs and cats and so on. and that's what's interesting to me because ultimately i feel that'll help us understand ourselves and maybe practice grappling moves. anyway, well, let me ask the advice question. now that we're together, i've spoken to john, i spoke to george. what advice would you give to young folks, whether we're talking about sport, excelling, becoming great at grappling, becoming great at fighting, becoming great at whatever sport they take on or life in general, whether they're maybe in high school or in college, what advice would you give them to excel at that thing they take on? i don't know if i'm qualified to answer this because i'm only 26. so you said giving advice to young people. for me, i think the two biggest things are find something that you're both talented in and you enjoy. i think that if you enjoy something, but you're terrible at it, it's going to be hard for you to be successful in life in that given area. and it's going to be hard to do something for long amounts of time if you're talented at it, but you don't enjoy doing it. it's easy to come in and train hard for a month or for two months or for a year. you can be very talented at it. but it's a different story to come in every day for five years in a row, for 10 years in a row, for 15 years in a row. so i think finding something that you're both talented in and something you enjoy are probably the two biggest things for me. how do you find the joy in it? so you've been training insane amount, a lot, you've been doing it for a long time. is there ways to rediscover the joy in it? yeah, for me initially, it was just learning new stuff. you come in as a white belt and every day you see a different move and you're , man, that's awesome. and then when i started to compete more seriously towards my professional career, it was the joy of doing camps and seeing the result of those camps and beating high level athletes. and then i got to a point where i'd beaten all the high level athletes already. so who am i going to compete against? so now for me, the joy is just being the best athlete i can possibly be until i reach my prime, which i'm hoping is somewhere between 35 and 40. so instead of competing against the other athletes, that would be bored already because i already beat all the rest of the guys. but i know that i can be better in a year from now or two years from now than i am today. and that for me is exciting. by the way, is there some aspect of teaching that's exciting to you? yeah. because you become a better and better teacher over the years. yeah, i definitely enjoy teaching and i used to teach a lot before i met john and then i met john and i was , yeah, i just have no idea how to teach. so that's a completely different element of the sport. doing things and being good at doing things or being good at winning and actually being able to communicate those skills and knowledge to a vast amount of people is two completely different things. george, advice for young people yourself? well, first i would tell them, find what you want to become, what you want to do. and long-term, use certain things maybe sometime you don't love, but where you want to propel yourself in the future. not what your parent, your friend wants you to become, what you, you, you want to become. so once you find it, you have to be ready to do it. you cannot do it by yourself. everything that is big achievement in life, we cannot do it by ourselves. so what i would say is second thing is try to build up your team and try to build up your team to be able to achieve your goal of people that are competent and people that you trust. you need both competency and trust. i see a lot of people sometime in business, for example, they hire people that they trust, but they turn out to be incompetent. so now you have to fire a friend or otherwise your business is going down. it's the same problem if you do the opposite, you hire someone that is competent, but you cannot trust, he's going to screw you. so it's very important to stay away from the negative, build up your team, people you trust and that are competent. and i would say the third one is to work, to work hard, to sacrifice yourself. you have to go through hell sometime, but you have to see the light at the end of it. to keep your dream in mind is going to give you the motivation to go through the tough time. it's nothing easy to go work, work, work. it's nothing you can accomplish without hard work. the fourth one, i would say to invest on yourself constantly. if you do not invest on yourself, on whatever you are in which business and sport, the game will catch up to you. for example, if you become champion at something and you stop improving, the other guys that are trying to be champion, they're going to catch up to you. so you need to invest on yourself. and most people, most athletes, they make the mistake when they start to have money, they buy luxury stuff. and that's one thing i didn't do. when i started making money, i was investing on traveling to new york, training with john gordon and the guys to learn what is new in the game of jiu-jitsu. i used to go in thailand, train muay thai, in los angeles to perfect my boxing skill. so instead of taking that money to buy me jewelry, cars, and to do what a lot of guys do, because it's a mistake, i invested on myself because i know there were people coming. they didn't want my place. so i didn't want them to catch me. and the last one i would say, it seems weird. i would say to give back. and it's not because i'm a nice guy. and it's not that i don't say that to look good. i say that when you make it, it creates opportunity where you can help certain group of people. but when i say give back, not give back to anybody, give back only to the cause that you want. i give back, not because i'm a nice guy. it's kind of selfish. i only give back to the people that i want to give back because i give back to them. and i know that if i'm more successful, i'm going to be able to give back to people i love, the cause that counts for me. so it brings me more motivation because i don't compete for myself anymore. i compete to help people i love in a way. so when you reach the top in your game, you need to find new motivation. if you satisfy, it's the end of it. your success will go down. so you need to find new motivation. what can motivate you? what do you want? i want to help this. i need to be successful. you need to find reason. what do you want to do with your success? so when i say give back, it's not because i'm necessarily, it's not to look a nice guy. it's to keep your motivation, to be able to keep climbing the ladder even more. that's beautiful, george. john? first off, the two responses given so far covered, i think, the most important things already. gordon talked about the need for an underlying passion and enjoyment. if you don't have that, you're not going to have the longevity that is required in order to build skills, which is ultimately, everything's going to come down to your ability to build skills. you've got to have some kind of underlying passion and enjoyment, which will keep you in the game long enough to build world championship skills. it's going to take a minimum of five years and quite possibly considerably longer than that. george talked about the idea of community. you're not going to make it by yourself. so you've got to be able to build people around you and build a trusting environment around you to develop those skills. what i would add to the excellent points that both already raised alludes to what i said at the start of this podcast. you've got to be able to identify some kind of undervalued elements in whatever industry you're in and show the world what their true value is. in addition, you can't go through life doing the same things as everybody else and expecting to get different results. this is straightforwardly irrational and worse, it's even arrogant. it's essentially the statement that i'm going to do this for the world, essentially the statement that i'm going to do the same thing as everyone else, but i believe i'm different. and so they'll work for me, but they didn't work for everyone else. that's saying, no, i'm special. no, you're not special. we're all pretty much the same. and in order to be special, you're going to have to exhibit skills that other people simply don't have. thirdly, i would say if you want to become something truly impressive in life, you've got to be able to focus on one or two things that you do better than anyone else in your industry. you can't learn everything, but you can take one or two skills and the more innovative those skills are, the better, and you can truly excel at them. for example, at the peak of his career, no one in the world was better than george st. pierre at integrating striking and takedowns. no one in the world was better at integrating grappling and striking on the ground. he had two things that he could confidently say he was the best in the world at. was he the best at every mma skill? nope. but he was absolutely the best at those two skills. and those two skills were skills which he used throughout his career to win the vast majority of his matches. gordon ryan at the onset of his career could confidently say there's no one in the world better than me at leg locks. he could also say there's no one better than the world than me at late stage defense to submission holds across the board. as he went through his career, he started adding more and more elements. it's gotten to an extraordinary degree now where he could absolutely say he's the best at guard passing, the best at guard retention, the less this keeps going on. and that goes back to what gordon said earlier about keeping things interesting over time because we're always introducing new skill sets. the day you start saying, i'm satisfied with my skill set is the day you get bored. and boredom to an athlete is a precursor to death by boredom. as long as you're still growing in those directions, you'll stay in the game for very long periods of time. so the main thing i would add to these statements by gordon and george is this idea of finding something which is currently undervalued and showing the world what its true value is. understanding that you can't just use the same training methodologies as everyone else and somehow expect to be different from everyone else. you've got to, almost every great rise in human civilization, whether it be groups of people or individuals, requires some kind of innovation. you've got to look for that new angle. george st. pierre found it with shoot boxing early on in his career. gordon ryan found it with leg locks early on in his career and they brushed up from that angle. add to this the idea that you want to become the absolute best in the world in your industry in one or two things that make a difference. find out what they are and focus on those things and you'll go far. john, gordon, george, this is an incredible conversation. thank you so much for your extremely valuable time, george. as somebody who's become famous in part by commenting on people's performance, how do you think we did? how would you evaluate our performance today? i'm not impressed by your performance. thank you, john. i loved it. i've learned all the time. i've talked to you guys. it's great. i loved it. i was very stimulated and really enjoyed it. yeah, it was something i really was looking forward to. i was hoping that we'd get together. it's so rare that at the same time in history, there will be some of the greats together. the fact that you guys would be willing to come together and talk this, this is awesome. then gordon, he would even wear a cowboy hat. this is just historic. this is churchill getting together with whoever. this is great and all, but the next one is just going to be us just quizzing john on which animals would win in fights for the whole three hours. we'll invite joe and we'll make it a systematic analysis. it'll be a debate between joe and john on which animal would win. john and i, we have a thing that we send each other footage all the time of animal fight where we are very intrigued about animal fight. i get them at 3.30 am on instagram. he's , check this out. like a rhino taking a pig. it's not always fair. no, no, it's not ever. but interesting stuff. if people would see what we send, the stuff that we- they would judge you harshly. yeah. all right. thanks so much guys. this was awesome. thanks for listening to this conversation with george st. pierre, john donahar and gordon ryan. to support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. and now let me leave you some words from miyamoto musashi. there's nothing outside yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker or smarter. everything is within. everything exists. seek nothing outside of yourself. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"12 eyes. comfortable. 1482 has passed. councilwoman, back where you please. what? council bill 1483 on the floor. yes, i move that council bill 18 1483 that would be placed upon final consideration and do pass. it has been moved and seconded. the public hearing for council bill 1483 is open. may we have the staff report? yes. thank you. good evening. i'm courtney livingston with community planning and development. this is a request to rezone a single property at 2625 walnut street from residential and mixed use. 20. that's a former chapter 59 zoning district. that's with weavers to imax three. design overlay seven. this property is in council district nine in the five points neighborhood. the site is approximately 9394 square feet in size and has a two story brick warehouse style building which is currently vacant. the owner of the subject property also owns the abutting building to the northeast and would to rezone the subject property to match the properties around it and to allow for an office use. so as previously mentioned, the site is zoned army 20 with waivers. this is a mixed use district and it has a former chapter 59 waiver requiring 10,000 square feet of office only. the subject property has about 22,000 square feet total, and the subject property is primarily surrounded by imax three. you have to dial seven. there are some cmu 20 with waivers also surrounding it. cmcsa 50207 surrounding it and you have a p you d also in there. the site is contributing a structure in the ballpark neighborhood historic district. any alterations to the existing building would need to go before lpc and a certificate of appropriateness would need to be issued. so the subject property is currently vacant. it was formerly occupied by an industrial use. it is generally surrounded by a mix of commercial, industrial and residential. these are a few photos of the subject's site. the top point is showing the subject property as well as the property to the northeast. in the bottom one is showing the subject property. these are also photos of the surrounding properties in the area. in terms of process. the map amendment application went before the planning board and there was a unanimous vote recommending approval with registered neighborhood organizations. these are the rino's that were notified. there was no public comment received from the general public. the r.a., the rhino arts district, commented that they had no issues with this request at all. as you know, to do to adapt to rezoning. there are criteria that must be met. we'll step through each one. consistency with adopted plans. there are three adopted plans that are applicable to this rezoning the comprehensive plan blueprint, denver 2002 and the northeast downtown neighborhood plan of 2011. with the comprehensive plan. the the map amendment is consistent with several strategies and it furthers those strategies for compact mixed use. with blueprint denver, the site has a concept plan use of mixed use, and these areas blueprint characterizes them by a mix of employment and housing with residential and nonresidential uses within walking distance of one another. the proposed rezoning, consistent with blueprints concept plan uses, allows for a mix of industrial, commercial and residential uses to develop in a pedestrian oriented pattern with buildings up to the street and an active street level. blueprint denver also identifies this as an area of change. the guidance for these areas is to channel growth and to these areas where it can be beneficial and improve access to jobs. the proposed rezoning is consistent with the area of change intent of the law for reinvestment and reuse and industrial mixed use zoning, creating access to jobs in an appropriate location with also those enhanced design standards . it's located walnut is a residential collector street. collectors are providing a greater balance and would support the mixed use development along a collector street and with the northeast downtown neighborhood plan. the future land use is shown here as mixed use industrial, noting that warehouse forms are compatible with residential housing types. the proposed i am x three design overlay seven district is consistent with the plan's vision for the area, allowing a walkable mix of compatible uses. it. also, the northeast downtown neighborhood plan talks about hype and recommends a maximum of five stories in the area for the stay at three stories. this is well under the maximum allowed and therefore is consistent with the plans recommendations. and then we have the applicability of the rhino design overlay deal of seven. it's consistent with the goals and objectives of the northeast. downtown neighborhoods plan to promote high quality design in the reno business improvement district, where there is a base zone district of mixed use. the building form standards of this design overlay ensure that the development implements this northeast downtown neighborhoods plan. the goals and objectives for walkability and design. so staff finds that the requesting zoning meets next correct to criteria the uniformity of district regulations as it results in a uniform application of the requested zone district and overlay . and it will further public health, safety and welfare, enabling more walkable mixed use district and the in-depth implementation of adopted plans. in terms of justifying circumstances. the former chapter 59 zone district of army 20 with waivers was put in place in 2004. since then, the denver zoning code has been adopted. that in itself is justification for the change, as we're going from former chapter 59 into the new code. and then finally, consistency with neighborhood context, zone, district purpose and intent. it's consistent with the industrial context to strip description that exist in the surrounding area. as the context transitions from industrial mixed use with an i'm x three, d or seven, it's also consistent with that purpose intent there as it promotes vibrant pedestrian street frontages with active uses and existing mix of industrial residential commercial uses that characterize the site and the surrounding area. with that said, cpd recommends approval based on finding that all applicable review criteria have been met. thank you. thank you very much. we have four individuals signed up to speak this evening. if you have signed up for this item, i would ask that you come to the front bench to be ready when your name is called to step up to the podium. first up, we have jerry burton. i'll get both of you to react. because i know. i'm sorry. you're going to have to. all right. next up, we have mariana thompson. ladies and gentlemen, you have heard from the previous bill, all of us activists, we see people dying on the streets. when are we going to turn around and take responsibility and quit adding to this problem when gentrification. and affordability. someone's life. it's been. taken. there are currently right now 23,000 children. i'm sorry, but i have to ask you for this hearing to speak specifically to this bill. thank you. okay. the answer is no. thank you. next up, chairman say. german. so cool, right? hmm. hmm. hmm hmm. i dare you to pass this bill. you are now setting up the ground square where poor people have absolutely nothing to lose in this city by engaging in activity to stop all of this. pass it? i do. because you're going to be adding to the pain. you're going to be adding more to the problem. and you keep blowing into this balloon till it busts. and then what you gonna do? but you can't do so because dr. king told us that you appeal to the conscience of people to see if they would change. but stokely carmichael said, you can't appeal to the conscience of people who ain't got no conscience. again, if you could speak directly to the. bill, please. so when we look at this unconscionable move to rezone rezoning, rezoning reason and then eliminate the population because there's no more land left. i would tell you right now, we ain't going nowhere. homeless or not, we are not going. and we refuse to not stand up for our right to be included in this town. and so if this not good for us. it is not good for nobody. and we're sick and tired of being sick and tired. thank you. next up, jesse pierce. jesse pierce, representing four black star acts. a moment for self-defense. denver holmes so loud and positive a commitment for social change. and i am also an at large candidate for denver city council, where a large election is may 7th in regards to this bill. we are definitely against this. it seems that the city has continues to miss priority. it's the priorities for this. the community wants for the city. we have a crisis. you want to build an office building that's going to employ who the are already neighbors that's being displaced and told to move along or to gentrify and transplants that you are seeming to similarly paved the way for. if this growing growth in developments, the people are being left behind. the people that built this city are being left behind, just the people that built this country are being left behind. and it seems that you guys have no stop in progress with it. so we are definitely against this. so we need to sweep the council they sweep the homeless every night. thank you. thank you. that concludes our speakers. are there any questions from members of council councilman brooks? thank you, mr. president. just a quick question for you. tell me your name. mia. i'm sorry. oh, kourtney. kourtney. all right, so i noticed that this is going back to the imax, which is the context around it. can you tell me just zooming out a little bit, what is the max height for imax citywide? imax three is. that's three stories. yeah, three. that's for this location. but we were engaged in a dialog in blueprint to try and get it to imax eight, imax five and other zone districts. and i just wanted to find out where that was in the community planning and development conversation. so i guess maybe i'm not i'm not sure i'm fully understanding the question because, you know, you have i'm x33 stories. i'm x five at five stories. i am. so you have progressive. yeah. so is that acceptable in the the reason i'm asking this question in this area, we've been and i'm pleased to see that this is amc's it's coming back to the imax in the context. but in this area there are different height limits that are allowing for higher. and i'm just asking is it still acceptable for imax eight in another context, do we have that in another zone district? um, so the i think we do have it. however, we have to look at the the neighborhood plan for guidance. yeah. there's is a conversation that many neighbors in this area are wanting because there's been some restrictions from cpd because there are certain capital markets bankers who are not lending into imax zone districts. it's been an issue. and so this has been an issue we've been talking about for five years. and i'm just sort of wanted to see where cpd was on it. is the developer here so we can find out what will actually help? come on. so what? what are you actually planning for this? my name is lisa thomas, lakewood, colorado, representing the developer who's a developer. i forget the entity, but the proposed uses to convert the existing building to office space. so nothing structurally would change. it's just interior renovation. you forget the entity that you're representing? yes. okay. what kind of office? that it cannot speak to general office space. okay. so so you, you know, as the applicant in front of us, you just want it to. why are you getting this zone? change that. because the current zoning does not allow for more than 10,000 square feet of office. the existing building is more than 10,000 square feet. current zoning also requires ten onsite parking stalls to be provided. the current. use. the current use is the arm. now the u.s. use its vacant building. it's a vacant building. and you guys are coming in to develop it here. when will that be? but we need to get the zoning approved the first step, and then we'd move forward with the entitlement process and permitting. okay. all right. thank you, councilman brooks. councilwoman ortega. thank you, mr. president. one of my questions was asked by councilman brooks about what the building is being used for right now. so we're understanding that it's vacant. i wanted to ask courtney if this building was at all looked at as a contributing building. by any chance, did landmark take a look at it? and what was the the status of that? yes, this property is in the ballpark, historic district. it is a contributing structure in that historic district. it's been before a landmark multiple times. they still need to be issued a certificate of appropriateness to move forward. it's my understanding, and correct me if i'm wrong, that it's not necessarily a demolition of the building, but an adaptive reuse . so if they want to change the the window, the fenestration at all, the the opening the door, anything they need to go through landmark to make sure that the changes are compatible because it is a contributing resource to that historic district. okay. so the doe seven overlay really does not apply unless the applicant or the owner if that changes were to attempt to demolish and build something else. right. so really, we're just talking about the base zoning. that's correct. okay. so that's all i have. so it's just going to be office use and we don't know what type yet. right. okay. i guess that's those are all the questions i have. thank you. thank you. councilwoman ortega. councilman espinosa. hey, you answered it, but maybe i want it sort of more plain speak. i just want to confirm that the the fact that the structure is contributing basically trumps any requirement from the doe seven. is that understood? right. it's an existing building. and so, you know, essentially these doe seven requirements are for a new construction. okay, great. that's it. thank. thank you, councilman espinosa. seeing no other questions. the public hearing for constable 1483 is closed. are there comments by members of council councilman brooks? yeah. i mean, this is, you know, given our criteria, this is in line with it. every other building zone district around this is an imax three. i want to tell the applicant, you need to know who you're representing. you want to you know, this is it's a big deal to come before city council, so you want to make sure you're prepared. and i would ask that before you come, the permits that you come in, make sure you tell us as the council representative what kind of office you're doing. that would be very helpful. i want to say to cpd that i'm pleased to see the industrial mixed use. i think i want to see more of it. you know, i know that we respond to what the applicants tell us, but to keep manufacturing opportunities in our city, i think is very important. and i also think that it's important that we add kind of that mixed use component. we've yet to see before this council, before the city, you know, mixed use, light industrial, having the ability for workforce housing in there. i mean, there are a lot of other cities that is that is kind of leading in that we've yet to see that. and so that's something that we really want to see. what i've heard from people who try and do that is that there's many difficulties with the city, there's many difficulties with getting loans to perform that . and so i love to look into that further. so this is something that that i'll be interested in seeing, especially in my district where there's a lot of industrial being resolved into c-max commercial space and we're losing much of our industrial zone districts. so i'll be supporting this because of the criteria is met and. that's it. thank you. councilman brooks, seeing no other comments. i just think thank you. big thank you to staff for all of the hard work on this and for all the information put forward in the staff report. and tonight, i think it's you've made it clear that this meets the criteria. and i will also echo councilman brooks sentiment about it's good it's really good to see some imax zoning coming through. so with that, i will be supporting this. and madam secretary, roll call on council bill 1483. brooks black, espinosa flynn, i. gilmore, i, herndon, i.

      "{'prompt': \"the following is a conversation with yaron brook, one of the best known objectivist philosophers and thinkers in the world. objectivism is the philosophical system developed by ayn rand that she first expressed in her fiction books, the fountainhead and atlas shrugged, and later in nonfiction essays and books. yaron is the current chairman of the board at the ayn rand institute, host of the yaron brook show, and the co-author of free market revolution, equal is unfair, and several other books where he analyzes systems of government, human behavior, and the human condition from the perspective of objectivism. quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. blinkist, an app i use for reading through summaries of books. expressvpn, the vpn i've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet. and cash app, the app i use to send money to friends. please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. as a side note, let me say that i first read atlas shrugged and the fountainhead early in college, along with many other literary and philosophical works from nietzsche, heidegger, kant, locke, foucault, wittgenstein, and of course, all the great existentialists, from kierkegaard to camus. i always had an open mind, curious to learn and explore the ideas of thinkers throughout history, no matter how mundane or radical or even dangerous they were considered to be. ayn rand was, and i think still is, a divisive figure. some people love her, some people dislike or even dismiss her. i prefer to look past what some may consider to be the flaws of the person and consider with an open mind the ideas she presents and yaron now describes and applies in his philosophical discussions. in general, i hope that you will be patient and understanding as i venture out across the space of ideas and the ever-widening overton window, pulling at the thread of curiosity, sometimes saying stupid things, but always striving to understand how we can better build a better world together. if you enjoy this thing, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcast, follow on spotify, support it on patreon, or connect with me on twitter at lex friedman. and now, here's my conversation with yaron brook. let me ask the biggest possible question first. sure. what are the principles of a life well-lived? i think it's to live with thought. that is, to live a rational life, to think it through. i think so many people are, in a sense, zombies out there. they're alive, but they're not really alive because their mind is not focused, their mind is not focused on what do i need to do in order to live a great life. so too many people just go through the motions of living rather than really embrace life. so i think the secret to living a great life is to take it seriously. and what it means to take it seriously is to use the one tool that makes us human, the one tool that provides us with all the values that we have, our mind, our reason, and to use it, apply it to living. people apply it to their work, they apply it to their math problems, to science, to programming. but imagine if they use that same energy, that same focus, that same concentration to actually living life and choosing values that they should pursue. that would change the world, and it would change their lives. yeah, actually, i wear this silly suit and tie. it symbolizes to me always, it makes me feel i'm taking the moment really seriously. i think that's really, that's right. and each one of us has different ways to kind of condition our consciousness. i'm serious now, and for you, it's a student tie. it's a conditioning of your consciousness to now i'm focused, now i'm at work, now i'm doing my thing. and i think that's terrific, and i wish everybody took that look. i mean, it's a cliche, but we only live once. every minute of your life, you're never gonna live again. this is really valuable. and when people don't have that deep respect for their own life, for their own time, for their own mind, and if they did, again, one could only imagine, look at how productive people are. look at the amazing things they produce and they do in their work. and if they applied that to everything, wow. so you kind of talk about reason. where does the kind of existentialist idea of experience maybe, fully experiencing all the moments versus fully thinking through? is there an interesting line to separate the two? why such an emphasis on reason for life well lived versus just enjoy, experience the moment? well, because i think experience in a sense is the easy part. i'm not saying it's how we experience the life that we live. and yes, i'm all with the take time to value what you value. but i don't think that's the problem of people out there. i don't think the problem is they're not taking time to appreciate where they are and what they do. i think it's that they don't use their mind in this one respect in planning their life, in thinking about how to live. so the focus is on reason is because it's our only source of knowledge. there's no other source of knowledge. we don't know anything that does not come from our senses and our mind, the integration of the evidence of our senses. now we know stuff about ourselves. and i think it's important to know oneself through introspection. and i consider that part of reasoning is to introspect. but i think reason is undervalued, which is funny to say, because it's our means of survival. it's how human beings survive. we cannot, see, this is where i disagree with so many scientists and people sam harris. you mentioned sam harris before the show. we're not programmed to know how to hunt. we're not programmed to do agriculture. we're not programmed to build computers and build networks on which we can podcast and do our shows. all of that requires effort. it requires focus. it requires energy and it requires will. it requires somebody to will it. it requires somebody to choose it. and once you make that choice, you have to engage that choice means that you're choosing to engage your reason in discovery, in integration, and then in work to change the world in which we live. and human beings had to discover, figure out, solve the problem of hunting. hunting, everybody thinks, , that's easy. i've seen the movie. but human beings had to figure out how to do it. you can't run down a bison and bite into it. you're not gonna catch it. you're not gonna, you have no fangs to bite into it. you have to build weapons. you have to build tools. you have to create traps. you have to have a strategy. all of that requires reason. so the most important thing that allows human beings to survive and to thrive in every value from the most simple to the most sophisticated, from the most material to, i believe, the most spiritual requires thinking. so stopping and appreciating the moment is something that i think is relatively easy once you have a plan, once you've thought it through, once you know what your values are. there is a mistake people make. they attain their values and they just, they don't take a moment to savor that and to appreciate that and to even pat themselves on the back that they did it, right? but that's not what's screwing up the world. what's screwing up the world is that people have the wrong values and they don't think about them and they don't really focus on them and they don't have a plan for their own life and how to live it. if we look at human nature, you're saying the fundamental big thing that we need to consider is our capacity, a capability to reason. so to me, reason is this massive evolutionary achievement, right, in quotes, right? if you think about any other sophisticated animal, everything has to be coded. everything has to be written in the hard way. it has to be there. and they have to have a solution for every outcome and if there's no solution, the animal dies, typically, or the animal suffers in some way. human beings have this capacity to self-program. they have this capacity. there's not, it's not a tabula rasa in the sense that there's nothing there. obviously we have a nature. obviously our minds, our brains are structured in a particular way. but given that, we have the ability to turn it on or turn it off. we have the ability to commit suicide, to reject our nature, to work against our interests, not to use the tool that evolution has provided us, which is this mind, which is reason. so that choice, that fundamental choice, hamlet says it, right, to be or not to be, but to be or not to be is to think or not to think, to engage or not to engage, to focus or not to focus. in the morning when you get up, you're kind of, you're not really completely there. you're kind of out of focus and stuff. it requires an act of will to say, okay, i'm awake, i've got stuff to do. some people never do that. some people live in that haze and they never engage that mind. and when you're sitting and try to solve a complex computer problem or a math problem, you have to turn something on. you have to, in a sense, it exerts certain energy to focus on the problem, to do it. and that is not determined in a sense that you have to focus. you choose to focus and you could choose not to focus. and that choice is more powerful than any other parts of our brain that we've borrowed from fish and from our evolutionary origins. like this, whatever this crazy little leap in evolution is that allowed us to think is more powerful than anything else. so i think newer scientists pretend they know a lot more about the brain than they really do. yeah. and we know very- shots fired. yeah. i agree with you. and we don't know that much yet about how the brain functions and what's a fish and all this stuff. so i think what exists there is a lot of potentialities. but the beauty of the human brain is it's potentialities that we have to manifest through our choices. it's there, it's sitting there. and yes, there's certain things that are gonna evoke certain senses, certain feelings. i'm not even saying emotions because i think emotions are too complex to have been programmed into our mind. but i don't think so. there's this big issue of evolutionary psychology is huge right now and it's a big issue. i find it to a large extent as way too early and in storytelling about, ex post storytelling about stuff, we still don't. so for example, i would to see evolutionary psychology differentiate between things inclinations, feelings, emotions, sensations, thoughts, concepts, ideas. what of those are programmed and what of those are developed and chosen and a product of reason? i think anything from emotion to abstract ideas is all chosen, is all a product of reason. and everything before that, we might've been programmed for. but the fact is, so clearly a sensation is not a product of, is something that we feel because that's how our biology works. so until we have these categories and until we can clearly specify what is what and where did they come from, the whole discussion in evolutionary psychology seems to be rambling. it doesn't seem to be scientific. so we have to define our terms, which is the basis of science. you have to have some clear definitions about what we're talking about. when you ask them these questions, there's never really a coherent answer about what is it exactly. and everybody is afraid of the issue of free will. and i think to some extent, i mean, harris has this, and i don't wanna misrepresent anything harris has because i'm a fan and i a lot of his stuff. but on the one hand, he is obviously intellectually active and wants to change our minds. so he believes that we have some capacity to choose. on the other hand, he's undermining that capacity to choose by saying it's just the term and so you're gonna choose what you choose. you have no say in it and there's actually no you. so it's, you know, so the, and that's to me completely unscientific. that's completely him, you know, pulling it out of nowhere. we all experienced the fact that we have no say in the fact that we have an i. that kind of certainty saying that we do not have that fundamental choice that reason provides is unfounded currently. look, there's a sense in which it can never be contradicted because it's a product of your experience. it's not a product of your experience. you can experience it directly. so no science will ever prove that this table isn't here. i can see it, it's here, right? and i can feel it. i know i have free will because i can introspect it. in a sense, i can see it. i can see myself engaging it. and that is as valid as the evidence of my senses. now i can't point at it so that you can see the same thing i'm seeing, but you can do the same thing in your own consciousness and you can identify the same thing. and to deny that in the name of science is to get things upside down. you start with that and that's the beginning of science. the beginning of science is the identification that i choose and that i can reason. and now i need to figure out the mechanism, the rules of reasoning, the rules of logic, the how does this work? and that's where science comes from. of course it's possible that science, from my place of ai would be able to, if we were able to engineer consciousness or understand, i mean it's very difficult because we're so far away from it now, but understand how the actual mechanism of that consciousness emerges, then in fact this table is not real. that we can determine exactly how our mind constructs the reality that we perceive. then you can start to make interesting. but our mind doesn't construct the reality that we perceive. the reality we perceive is there. we perceive a reality that exists. now we perceive it in particular ways given the nature of our senses. a bat perceives this table differently, but it's still the same table with the same characteristics and the same identity. it's just a matter of we use eyes, they use a radar system to, they use sound waves to perceive it. but it's still there. existence exists whether we exist or not. and so you could create, i mean i don't know how, and i don't know if it's possible, but let's say you could create a consciousness, right? and i suspect that to do that, you would have to use biology, not just electronics, but way outside my expertise. because consciousness, as far as we know, is a phenomena of life, and you would have to figure out how to create life before you created consciousness, i think. but if you did that, then that wouldn't change anything. all it would say is we have another conscious being. cool, that's great. but it wouldn't change the nature of our consciousness. our consciousness is what it is, in respect. so that's very interesting. i think this is a good way to set the table for discussion of objectivism is, let me at least challenge a thought experiment, which is, i don't know if you're familiar with donald hoffman's work about reality. so his idea is that we're just, our perception is just an interface to reality. so donald hoffman is the guy you see over there? yeah. yes, i've met donald, and i've seen his video. and look, donald has not invented anything new. this goes back to ancient philosophy. let me just state it in case people aren't familiar. i mean, it's a fascinating thought experiment to me, out of the box thinking, perhaps literally, is that there's a gap between the world as we perceive it, and the world as it actually exists. and i think that's, for the philosophy of objectivism, is a really important gap to close. so can you maybe at least try to entertain the idea that there is more to reality than our minds can perceive? well, i don't understand what more means, right? because there's more to reality than what our senses perceive. that is, for example, i don't know, certain elements have radiation, right? uranium has radiation. i can't perceive radiation. the beauty of human reason is, i can, through experimentation, discover the phenomena of radiation, then actually measure radiation, and i don't worry about it. i can't perceive the world the way a bat perceives the world, and i might not be able to see certain things. but i can, we've created radar, so a, we understand how a bat perceives the world, and i can mimic it through a radar screen and create images the bat, its consciousness somehow perceives it, right? so the beauty of human reason is our capacity to understand the world beyond what our senses give us directly. at the end, everything comes in through our senses, but we can understand things that our senses don't provide us. but what he's doing is he's doing something very different. he is saying what our senses provides us might have nothing to do with the reality out there. that is just a random, arbitrary, nonsensical statement. and he actually has a whole evolutionary explanation for it. he runs some simulations. the simulations seem, i mean, i'm not an expert in this field, but they seem silly to me. they don't seem to reflect. and look, all he's doing is taking immanuel kant's philosophy, which articulate exactly the same cause, and he's giving it a veneer of evolutionary ideas. i'm not an expert on evolution, and i'm not an expert on epistemology, which is what this is. so to me, as a semi-layman, it doesn't make any sense. and i'm actually, i have this your honor book show. i don't know if i'm allowed to pitch it, but i've got this your honor book show on youtube. i'm a huge fan of the your honor book show. i listen to it very often. as a small aside, the cool thing about reason, which you practice, is you have a systematic way of thinking through basically anything. yes. and that's so fun to listen to. i mean, it's rare that i think there's flaws in your logic, but even then it's fun, because i'm disagreeing with the screen. and it's great when somebody disagrees with me, and they give good arguments, because that makes it challenging. and you can say. so one of the shows i wanna do in the next few weeks is bring one of my philosopher friends to discuss the video that hoffman, where he presents his theory, because it surprises me how seductive it is. and it seems to be so, first of all, completely counterintuitive, but because somehow we managed to cross the road and not get hit by the car, and if our senses do not provide us any information about what's actually going on in reality, how do we do that? and not to mention build computers, not to mention flight to the moon, and actually land on the moon. and if reality is not giving us information about the moon, if our senses are not giving us information about the moon, how did we get there? and where did we go? maybe we didn't go anyway. it's just, it's nonsensical to me, and it's a very bad place philosophically, because it basically says there is no objective standard for anything. there is no objective reality. you can come up with anything. you could argue anything, and there's no methodology. i believe that at the end of the day, what reason allows us to do is provides us with a methodology for truth. and at the end of the day, for every claim that i make, i should be able to boil it down to see, look, the evidence of the senses is right there. and once you take that away, knowledge is gone, and truth is gone, and that opens it up to complete disaster. so to me, why it's compelling to at least entertain this idea, first of all, it shakes up the mind a little bit to force you to go back to first principles, and ask the question, what do i really know? and the second part of that that i really enjoy is it's a reminder that we know very little, to be a little bit more humble. so if reality doesn't exist at all, before you start thinking about it, i think it's a really nice wake-up call to think, wait a minute, i don't really know much about this universe, that humbleness. i think something i'd to ask you about in terms of reason, when you, you can become very confident in your ability to understand the world if you practice reason often. and i feel it can lead you astray, because you can start to think, so i love psychology, and psychologists have this certainty about understanding the human condition, which is undeserved. you run a study with 50 people, and you think you can understand the source of all these psychiatric disorders, all these kinds of things. that's similar kind of trouble i feel you can get into when you overreach with reason. so i don't think there is such a thing as overreaching with reason, but there are bad applications of reason. there are bad uses of reason, or the pretense of using reason. i think a lot of these psychological studies are pretense of using reason, and these psychologists have never really taken a serious stat class or a serious econometrics class, so they use statistics in weird ways that just don't make any sense. and that's not reason, right? that's just bad thinking, right? so i don't think you can do too much good thinking, and that's what reason is, it's good thinking. now, the fact that you try to use reason does not guarantee you won't make mistakes. it doesn't guarantee you won't be wrong. it doesn't guarantee you won't go down a rabbit hole and completely get it wrong, but it does give you the only existing mechanism to fix it, which is going back to reality, going back to facts, going back to reason, and getting out of the rabbit hole and getting back to reality. so i agree with you that it's interesting to think about these, what i consider crazy ideas, because it, wait, what is my argument about them? if i don't really have a good argument about them, then do i know what i know? so in that sense, it's always nice to be challenged and pushed and oriented. the nice thing about objectivism is everybody's doing that to me all the time, right? because nobody agrees with me on anything. so i'm constantly being challenged, whether it's in, by hoffman on metaphysics and epistemology, right? on the very foundations of analogy, in ethics, everybody constantly, and in politics all the time. so i find that it's part of, i prefer that everybody, there's a sense in which i prefer that everybody agreed with me, right? because i think we live in a better world. but there's a sense in which that disagreement makes it, at least up to a point, makes it interesting and challenging and forces you to be able to rethink or to confirm your own thinking and to challenge that thinking. can you try to do the impossible task and give a whirlwind introduction to ayn rand, the many sides of ayn rand. so ayn rand, the human being, ayn rand, the novelist, and ayn rand, the philosopher. so who was ayn rand? sure, so her life story is one that i think is fascinating, but it also lends itself to this integration of all of these things. she was born in st. petersburg, russia in 1905 to kind of a middle-class family, jewish family. they owned a pharmacy, her father owned a pharmacy. and she grew up, she was a very, she knew what she wanted to do and what she wanted to be from a very young age. i think from the age of nine, she knew she wanted to be a writer. she wanted to write stories. that was the thing she wanted to do. and she focused her life after that on this goal of, i wanna be a novelist, i wanna write. and the philosophy was incidental to that in a sense, at least until some point in her life. she witnessed the russian revolution, literally it happened outside. they lived in st. petersburg where the first kind of demonstrations and of the revolution happened. so she witnessed it. she lived through it as a teenager, went to school under the soviets. for a while they were under kind of the, on the black sea where the opposition government was ruling and then they would go back and forth between the communists and the whites. but she experienced what communism was . she saw the pharmacy being taken away from her family. she saw their apartment being taken away or other families being brought into the apartment they already lived in. and it was very clear given her nature, given her views, even at a very young age, that she would not survive the system. so a lot of effort was put into how do we get, how does she get out? and her family was really helpful in this. and she had a cousin in chicago and she had been studying kind of film at the university. and- this is in her 20s? this is in her 20s, early 20s. and lenin, there was a small window where lenin was allowing some people to leave under certain circumstances. and she managed to get out to go do research on film in the united states. everybody knew, everybody who knew her knew she would never come back, that this was a one-way ticket. and she got out, she made it to chicago, spent a few weeks in chicago and then headed to hollywood. she wanted to write scripts. that was the goal. here's this short woman from russia with a strong accent, learning english, showing up in hollywood and i wanna be a script writer. in english. in english, writing in english. and this is kind of one of these fairy tale stories, but it's true. she shows up at the cecil b. demille studios. and she has a letter of introduction from her cousin in chicago who owns a movie theater. and this is in the late 1920s. and she shows up there with this letter and they say, don't call us, we'll call you kind of thing. and she steps out and there's this massive convertible. and in the convertible is cecil b. demille. and he's driving slowly past her right at the entrance of the studio. and she stares at him and he stops the car and he says, why are you staring at me? and she says, she tells him a story for russia and i wanna make it in the movies. i wanna be a script writer one day. and he says, well, if you want that, get in the car. she gets in the car and he takes her to the back lot of his studio where they're filming the king of kings, the story of jesus. and he says, here's a pass for a week. if you wanna write for the movies, you better know how movies are made. and she basically spends a week and then she spends more time there. she managed to get an extension. she ends up being an extra in the movie so you can see a man there and it was one of the masses when jesus is walking by. she meets her future husband on the sets of the king of kings. she lands up getting married, getting her american citizenship that way. and she lands up doing odds and ends jobs in hollywood, living in a tiny little apartment, somehow making a living. her husband was an actor. he was struggling actors with difficult times. and in the evenings, studying english, writing, writing, writing, writing, and studying and studying and studying. she finally makes it by writing a play that is successful in la and ultimately goes to broadway. and she writes her first novel is a novel called we the living, which is the most autobiographical of all her novels. it's about a young woman in the soviet union. it's a powerful story, a very moving story and probably if not the best, one of the best portrayals of life under communism. and- so you would recommend the book. definitely recommend we the living. it's her first novel. she wrote in the thirties and it didn't go anywhere because if you think about the intelligentsia, the people who matter, the people who wrote book reviews, this is a time of durante, who's the new york times guy in moscow, who's praising stalin to the hills and the success. so the novel fails, but she's got a novel out. she writes a small novelette called anthem. a lot of people have read that and it's read in high schools. it's kind of dystopian novel and it doesn't get published in the us. it gets published in the uk. uk is very interested in dystopian novels. animal farm in 1984, 84 is published a couple of years after i think, after anthem. there's reason to believe he read anthem. george orwell wrote for animal farm. yeah. just a small aside, animal farm is probably top. i mean, it's weird to say, but i would say it's my favorite book. have you seen this movie out now called mr. jones? no. oh, you've got to see mr. jones. what's mr. jones? it's a- sorry for my ignorance. no, no, it's a movie. it hasn't got any publicity, which is tragic because it's a really good movie. it's both brilliantly made. it's made by a polish director, but it's in english. it's a true story. and george orwell's animal farm is featured in it in the sense that during the story, george orwell was writing animal farm and the narrator is reading off sections of animal farm as the movie is progressing. and the movie is a true story about the first western journalist to discover and to write about the famine in ukraine. and so he goes to moscow and then he gets on a train and he finds himself in ukraine and it's beautifully and horrifically made. so the horror of the famine is brilliantly conveyed. and then, and it's a true story. it's a very moving story, very powerful story and just very well-made movie. so it's tragic in my view that not more people are seeing it. i was actually recently just complaining that there's not enough content on the famine, the 30s of, you know, of stuff. there's so much on hitler. like i love the reading. i'm reading, it's so long. it's been taking me forever. the rise and falls of the third reich. yeah, i love it. i've got the book to compliment that, that you have to read. it's called the ominous parallels. it's lenin-pikov and it's the ominous parallels and it's about the causes of the rise of hitler, but a philosophical causes. so whereas the rise and fall is more of a kind of the existential kind of what happened, but really delving into the intellectual currents that led to the rise of hitler. and maybe- highly recommend that. and basically suggesting how it might rise another. that's the ominous parallel. so the parallel he draws is to the united states. and he says those same intellectual forces are rising in the united states. and this is, this was published, i think in, published in 81, 82, it was published in 82. so it was published a long time ago. and yet you look around us and it's unbelievably predictive sadly about the state of the world. so i haven't finished iron man's story. i don't want to, i don't know if you want me to- no, no, but on that point, i'll have to, let's please return to it, but let's now, for now let's talk- let me also say just because i don't forget about mr. jones, it is true, the point you made, there are tons of movies that are anti-fascist, anti-nazi. and that's good. but there are way too few movies that are anti-communist. just almost not. and it's very interesting. and if you remind me later, i'll tell you a story about that. but so she publishes anthem and then she starts, and she's doing okay in hollywood and she's doing okay with the play. and then she starts on the book, the fountainhead, and she writes the fountainhead and it comes out, she finishes it in 1945 and she sends it to publishers and publisher after publisher after publisher turn it down. and it takes 12 publishers before this editor reads it and says, i wanna publish this book. and he basically tells his bosses, if you don't publish this book, i'm leaving. and they don't really believe in the book. so they publish just a few copies. they don't do a matlock. and the book becomes a bestseller from word of mouth. and they land up having to publish more and more and more. and it's, she's basically gone from this immigrant who comes here with very little command of english and to all kinds of odds and ends jobs in hollywood to writing one of the seminal, i think, american books. she is an american author. i mean, if you read the fountainhead, it's not russian. this is not dostoevsky. it feels a symbol of what america is in the 20th century. and i mean, probably maybe you can, so there's a famous kind of sexual rape scene in there. is that a lesson you wanna throw in some controversial stuff to make your philosophical books work out? i mean, is that, why was it so popular? do you have a sense? or is it- well, because i think it illustrated, first of all, because i think the characters are fantastic. it's got a real hero. and i think the whole book is basically illustrating this massive conflict that i think went on in america then. it's going on today, and it goes on in a big scale, politics, all the way down to the scale of the choices you make in your life. and the issue is individualism versus collectivism. should you live for yourself? should you live for your values? should you pursue your passions? or should you do what your mother tells you? should you follow your mother's passions? and it's very, very much a book about individuals, and people relate to that. but it obviously has this massive implications to the world outside. and at the time of collectivism just having been defeated, communist, well, fascism and the united states representing individualism, right, has defeated collectivism. but where collectivist ideas are still popular in the form of socialism and communism. and for the individual, there's constant struggle between what people tell me to do, what society tells me to do, what my mother tells me to do, and what i think i should do. i think it's unbelievably appealing, particularly to young people who are trying to figure out what they wanna do in life, trying to figure out what's important in life. it had this enormous appeal. it's romantic, it's bigger than life, the characters are big heroes. it's very american in that sense. it's about individualism, it's about the triumph of individualism. and so i think that's what related. and it had this big romantic element from the, i mean, when i use romantic, i use it kind of in the sense of a movement in art. but it also has this romantic element in the sense of a relationship between a man and woman who's, that's very intriguing. it's not only that there's a, i would say, almost rape scene, right? yes. i would say, but it's also that this woman is hard to understand. i mean, i've read it more than once, and i still can't quite figure out dominique, right? because she loves him and she wants to destroy him, and she marries other people. i mean, think about that too. here she's writing a book in the 1940s. there's lots of sex. there's a woman who marries more than one person, having sex with more than one person, very unconventional. so she's having married, she's having sex with work, even though she's not married to work. this is 1945. and it's very jarring to people. it's very unexpected, but it's also a book of its time. it's about individuals pursuing their passion, pursuing their life, and not caring about convention and what people think, but doing what they think is right. and so i think it's, i encourage everybody to read it, obviously. so was that the first time she articulated something that sounded a philosophy of individualism? i mean, the philosophy is there in we the living, right? because at the end of the day, the woman is, the hero of we the living is this individualist stuck in soviet union, so she's struggling with these things. so the theme is there already. it's not as fleshed out. it's not as articulated philosophically. and it's certainly there in anthem, which is a dystopian novel, where this dystopia in the future has, there's no i, everything is we. and it's about one guy who breaks out of that. i don't wanna give it away, but breaks out of that. so these themes are running, and then we have, and they've been published, some of the early ayn rand stories that she was writing in preparation for writing her novel, stories she was writing when she first came to america. and you can see these same philosophical elements, even in the male-female relationships and the passion and the, you know, in the conflict, you see them even in those early pieces. and she's just developing them. it's same philosophically. she's developing her philosophy with her literature. and of course, after the fountainhead, she starts on what turns out to be her magnus opus, which is atlas shrugged, which takes her 12 years to publish. by the time, of course, she brings that out. every publisher in new york wants to publish it because the fountainhead has been such a huge success. they don't quite understand it. they don't know what to do with atlas shrugged, but they're eager to get it out there. and indeed, when it's published, it becomes an instant bestseller. and the thing about the, particularly the fountainhead and atlas shrugged, but true of even anthem and we the living, she is one of the only dead authors that sell more after they've died than when they were still alive. now, that's true, maybe music, we listen to more beethoven than when he was alive, but it's not true typically of novelists. and yet here we are, what is it, 50, 60 years after, 63 years after the publication of atlas shrugged, and it sells probably more today than it sold when it was a bestseller when it first came out. is it true that it's one of the most sold books in history? no. okay. i've heard this kind of statement. any tom clancy book comes out, sells more than atlas shrugged. but i've read, i've heard statements this. so there was a very, and i shouldn't say this, but it's the truth, so i'll say it, a very unscientific study done by the smithsonian institute, probably in the early 90s, that basically surveyed ceos and asked them, what was the most influential book on you? and atlas shrugged came out as number two, the second most influential book in ceos in the country. but there's so many flaws in the study. one was, you wanna guess what the number one book? the bible. the bible. but the bible was , so maybe they surveyed 100 people. i don't know what the exact numbers were, but let's say it's 100 people, and 60 said the bible and 10 said atlas shrugged, and there were a bunch of books over there. so i don't- that's again, the psychology discussion we were having earlier. exactly. well, and it's one thing i've learned, and maybe covid has taught me, and there are very few people who know how to do statistics, and almost nobody knows how to think probabilistically. that is, think in terms of probabilities, that it is a skill, it's a hard skill, and everybody thinks they know it. so i see doctors thinking they're statisticians and giving whole analyses of the data on covid, and they don't have a clue what they're talking about, not because they're not good doctors, but because they're not good statisticians. it's not, people think that they have one skill, and therefore it translates immediately into another skill, and it's just not true. so i've been astounded at how bad people are at that. for people who haven't read any of the books that we were just discussing, what would you recommend? what book would you recommend they read? and maybe also just elaborate what mindset should they enter the reading of that book with? so i would recommend everybody read fountainhead and atlas shrugged. and in one order- in that order? so it would depend on where you are in life, right? so it depends on who you are and what you are. so fountainhead is a more personal story. for many people, it's their favorite, and for many people, it's their first book, and they wouldn't replace that, right? atlas shrugged is about the world. it's about what impacts the world, how the world functions, how it's a bigger book in the sense of the scope. if you're interested in politics and you're interested in the world, read atlas shrugged first. if you're mainly focused on your life, your career, what you wanna do with yourself, start with fountainhead. i still think you should read both, because i think they are- i mean, to me, they were life-altering, and to many, many people, they're life-altering, and you should go into reading them with an open mind, i'd say, and with a- put aside everything you've heard about iron man. put aside any- even if it's true, just put it aside, even what i just said about iron man, put it aside. just read the book as a book, and let it move you and let your thoughts, let it shape how you think, and it'll have, you'll either have a response to it or you won't, but i think most people have a very strong response to it, and then the question is, are they willing to respond to the philosophy? are they willing to integrate the philosophy? are they willing to think through the philosophy or not? because i know a lot of people who completely disagree with the philosophy, right? here in hollywood, right? lots of people here in hollywood. love the fountainhead. interesting. oliver stone, who is, i think, a vowed marxist, right? i think he's admitted to being a marxist. he is, his movies certainly reflect the marxist theme, is a huge fan of the fountainhead, and is actually his dream project, he has said in public, his dream project is to make the fountainhead. now, he would completely change it, as movie directors do, and he's actually outlined what his script would look , and it would be a disaster for the ideas of the fountainhead, but he loves the story, because to him, the story is about artistic integrity. and that's what he catches on, and what he hates about the story is the individualism, and i think that his movie ends with howard walker joining some kind of commune of architects that do it for the love and don't do it for the money. interesting, so yeah, so you can connect with you without the philosophy, and before we get into the philosophy, staying on ayn rand, i'll tell you sort of my own personal experience, and i think it's one that people share. i've experienced this with two people, ayn rand and nietzsche. when i brought up ayn rand when i was in my early 20s, the number of eye rolls i got from sort of, you know, advisors and so on, that, of dismissal, i've seen that later in life about more specific concepts in artificial intelligence and technical where people decide that this is a set of ideas that are acceptable, and these sets of ideas are not, and they dismissed ayn rand without giving me any justification of why they dismissed her, except, , that's something you're into when you're 19 or 20. that's same thing people say about nietzsche, well, that's just something you do when you're in college and you take an intro to philosophy course. so, and i've never really heard anybody cleanly articulate their opposition to ayn rand in my own private little circles and so on. maybe one question i just wanna ask is, why is there such a opposition to ayn rand? and maybe another way to ask the same thing is, what's misunderstood about ayn rand? so, we haven't talked about the philosophy, so it's harder to answer right now. we can return to it if you think that's the right way to go. well, let me give a broad answer, and then we'll do the philosophy, and then we'll return to it, because i think it's important to know something about her ideas. she, i think her philosophy challenges everything. it really does, it shakes up the world. it challenges so many of our preconceptions, it challenges so many of the things that people take for granted as truth. from religion to morality to politics to almost everything, it's never quite been a thinker her in the sense of really challenging everything and doing it systematically, and having a complete philosophy that is a challenge to everything that has come before her. now, i'm not saying they're on threads that connect, they are, right? in politics, there might be a thread, in morality, there might be a thread, but on everything, there's just never been it. and people are afraid of that, because it challenges them to the core. she's basically telling you to rethink almost everything. and that is that people reject. the other thing that it does, and this goes to this point about, yeah, that's what you do when you're 14, 15, right? yeah. she points out to them that they've lost something. they've lost their idealism. they've lost the youthful idealism. what makes youthfulness meaningful? other than we're in better physical shape, starting to feel, because i'm getting older. when we're young, sometimes in the teen years, there's something that happens to human consciousness. we almost awaken and new, right? we suddenly discover that we can think for ourselves. we suddenly discover that not everything our parents and our teachers tell us is true. we suddenly discover that this tool, our minds, is suddenly available to us to discover the world and to discover truth. and it is a time of idealism. it's a time of, whoa, i wanna, you know, the better teenagers, i wanna know about the world. i wanna go out there. i don't believe my parents. i don't believe my teachers. and this is healthy. this is fantastic. and i wanna go out there and experiment. and that gets us into trouble, right? we do stupid things when we're teenagers. why? because we're experimenting. it's the experiential part of it, right? we wanna go and experience life, but we're learning. it's part of the learning process. and we become risk takers because we wanna experience. but the risk is something we need to learn because we need to learn where the boundaries are. and one of the damages that helicopter parents do is they prevent us from taking those risks so we don't learn about the world and we don't learn about where the boundaries are. so the teenage years of these years of wonder, they're depressing when you're in them for a variety of reasons, which i think primarily have to do with the culture, but also with oneself. but they are exciting, the periods of discovery. and people get excited about ideas and good ideas, bad ideas, all kinds of ideas. and then what happens? we settle. we compromise. whether that happens in college where we're taught that nothing exists and nothing matters and start being a nihilist, be a cynics, be whatever. or whether it happens when we get married and get a job and have kids and are too busy and can't think about ideals and forget and just get into the norm of conventional life. or whether it's because a mother pester us pesters us to get married and have kids and do all the things that she wanted us to do. we give up on those ideals. and there's a sense in which ayn rand reminds them that they gave up. that's so beautifully put and so true. it's worth pausing on that this dismissal, people forget the beauty of that curiosity. that's true in the scientific field too. that youthful joy of everything is possible and we can understand it with the tools of our mind. yes. and that's what it's all about. that's what ayn rand's ideas at the end of the day all brought down to is that confidence and that passion and that curiosity and that interest. and if you think about what academia does to so many of us, right? we go into academia and we're excited about, we're gonna learn stuff, we're gonna discover things. and then they stick you into sub sub field and examining some minutiae that's insignificant and unimportant and to get published, you have to be conventional. you have to do what everybody else does. and then there's the tenure process of seven years where they put you through this torture to write papers that fit into a certain mold. and by the time you're done, you're in your mid thirties and you've done nothing, you discovered nothing. you're all in this minutia in this stuff and it's destructive. and whiz holding onto that passion, holding onto that knowledge and that confidence is hard. and when people do away with it, they become cynical and they become part of the system and they inflict the same pain on the next guy that they suffered because that's part of how it works. yeah, there's a, this happens in artificial intelligence. this happens when a young person shows up and with fire in their eyes and they say, i wanna understand the nature of intelligence. and everybody rolls their eyes. well, for these same reasons, because they've spent so many years on the very specific set of questions that kind of they compete over and they write papers over and they have conferences about, and it's true, that incremental research is the way you make progress. answering the question of what is intelligence is exceptionally difficult. but when you mock it, you actually destroyed the realities. when we look centuries from now, we'll look back at this time for this particular field of artificial intelligence, it will be the people who will be remembered, will be the people who've asked the question and made it their life journey of what is intelligence and actually had the chance to succeed. most will fail asking that question, but the ones that had a chance of succeeding and had that throughout their whole life. and i suppose the same is true for philosophy. it's in every field. it's asking the big questions and staying curious and staying passionate and staying excited and accepting failure, right? accepting that you're not gonna get it first time. you're not gonna get the whole thing. and sometimes you have to do the minutiae work. and i'm not here to say nobody should specialize and you shouldn't do the minutiae. you have to do that. but there has to be a way to do that work and keep the passion and keep it all integrated. that's another thing. i mean, we don't live in a culture that integrates, right? we live in a culture that is all about this minutiae and not, and medicine is another field where you specialize in the kidney. i mean, the kidneys connected to other things. you've gotta, and we don't have a holistic view of these things. and i'm sure in artificial intelligence, you're not gonna make the big leaps forward without a holistic view of what it is you're trying to achieve. and maybe that's the question of what is intelligence, but that's the kind of questions you have to ask to make big leaps forward, to really move the field in a positive direction. and it's the people who can think that way, who move fields and move technology, who move anything. anything is, everything is . but just you said, it's painful because underlying that kind of questioning is, well, maybe the work i've done for the past 20 years was a dead end. and you have to kind of face that. even just, it might not be true, but even just facing that reality, it's just, it's a painful feeling. absolutely. but that's part of the reason why it's important to enjoy the work that you do. so that even if it doesn't completely work out, at least you enjoy the process. it was not a waste because you enjoyed the process. and if you learn, as any entrepreneur knows this, and if you learn from the waste of time, from the errors, from the mistakes, then you can build on them and make things even better. and so the next 20 years, i'm a massive success. can we, another impossible task. so you did wonderfully on talking about ayn rand. the other impossible task of giving a whirlwind overview of the philosophy of objectivism, the philosophy of ayn rand. yeah, so luckily she did it in an essay. she talks about doing a philosophy on one foot. but let me integrate it with the literature and with her life a little bit. she wanted to be a writer, but her goal, she had a particular goal in her writing. she was an idealist, right? she wanted to portray the ideal man. so one of the things you do when you want to do something is what is an ideal man? you have to ask that question. what does that mean? you might have a sense of it. you might have certain glimpses of it in other people's literature, but what is it? so she starts reading philosophy to try to figure out what do philosophers say about the ideal man. and what she finds horrifies her in terms of the view of most philosophers of man. and she's attracted, certainly when she's young, to nietzsche because nietzsche at least has a vision of grandeur for man, even though his philosophy is very flawed and has other problems and contradicts man in many ways. but at least he has that vision of what is possible to man. and she's attracted to that romantic vision, that idealistic vision. so she discovers in writing, and particularly in writing at le chug, but even in the frontenac, that she's gonna have to develop her own philosophy. she's gonna have to discover these ideas for herself because they're not fully articulated anywhere else. they glimpses again of it in aristotle, in nietzsche, but they're not fully fleshed out. so to a large extent, she develops a philosophy for a very practical purpose, to write, to write a novel about the ideal man. and alice schruck is the manifestation of that. and alice schruck. sorry, and to interrupt, as a little aside, she does, when you say man, you mean human. and because we'll bring this up often, maybe you can elaborate of how she specifically uses man and he in the work. we live in a time now where gender is so. well, she did that in the sense that everybody did it during her period of time. it's only in modern times where we do he slash she. historically, when you said he, you meant a human being, unless the particular context implied that it was a... but in einstein's case, in this case, in this one sentence, she probably meant man. not that because she viewed that there are differences between men and women were not the same, which i know comes at a shock to many people. but she was- she was working on a character. she was working on a particular vision, right? she considered herself a man worshiper, a man, not human being, a male. she worshiped manhood, if you will, the hero in man. and she wanted to fully understand what that was. now, it has massive implications for ideal woman. and i think she does portray the ideal woman in atlas shrugged in the character of dagny. but her goal is, i think her selfish goal for what she wanted to get out of the novel is that excitement, partially sexual, about seeing your ideal manifest in reality of what you perceive as that which you would be attracted to, fully, intellectually, physically, sexually, in every aspect of your life. that's what she's trying to bring into it. so there was no ambiguity of gender. so there was a masculinity and a femininity in her work. very much so. and if you read the novels, you see that. you see that. now, remember, this is in the context of, in atlas shrugged, she is portraying a woman who runs a railroad, the most masculine of all jobs you could imagine, right? running a railroad, better than any man can run it. yes. and achieving huge success, better than any other man out there. but, but for her, even dagny needs somebody to, needs a man in some sense to look up to. yeah. and that's the character whose name i will mention because it gives away too much of the plot. but there has to be- i how you do that. you're good. you're not, a lot of practice. a lot of practice. that's brilliant. because you convey all the important things without giving away plot lines. that's beautiful. you're a master. so she's very much, she described herself once as a male chauvinist. okay. she very, she likes the idea of a man opening a door for her. but more metaphysically, she identifies something in the difference between a way a man relates to a woman and a woman relates to a man. it's not the same. and let's not take too far of a tangent, but i just, as a side comment, to me she represented, she was a feminist to me. perhaps there's a, perhaps technically philosophical, you disagree with that, whatever, but that to me represented strong, she had some of the strongest female characters in the history of literature. again, this is a woman running a railroad in 1957. yeah. and not just a woman running a railroad, and this is true of the fountainhead as well. a woman who is sexually, in a sense, assertive, sexually open, this is not a woman who, this is a woman who embraces her sexuality. and sex is important in life. this is why it keeps coming up. it was important to ayn rand, it's important in the novels, it's important in life. and for her, one's attitude towards sex is reflection of one's attitude towards life. and what attitude towards pleasure, which is an important part of life. and she thought that was an incredibly important thing. and so she has these assertive, powerful sexual women who live their lives on their terms 100, who seek a man to look up to. yeah. now, this psychologically complex, it's more psychology than philosophy, right? it's psychologically complex, and not my area of expertise, but this is something, and she would argue, there's something fundamentally different about a male and a woman, about a male and female, psychologically in their attitude towards one another. yeah, but as a side note, i would say that, i don't know philosophically, if her ideas about gender are interesting. i think her other philosophical ideas are much more interesting. but reading-wise, the stories it created, the tension it created, that was pretty powerful. i mean, that's pretty powerful stuff. i'll speculate that the reason it's so powerful is because it reflects something in reality. yeah, that's true. there's a thread that at least holds up. and look, it's really important to say, i think she was the first feminist in a sense. i think in a sense, the feminists have perverted feminism into something that it shouldn't be. but in the sense of men and women are capable, she was the first one who really put that into a novel and showed it. to me, as a boy, when i was reading atlas shrugged, i think i read that before fountainhead. that was one of the early introductions, at least of an american woman, i had examples of my own life with russian women, but of a badass lady. like i admire, i love engineering. i had loved that she could, here's a lady that's running the show. so that at least to me was an example of a really strong woman, but objectivism. objectivism. so, and so she developed it for a novel. she spent the latter part of her life after the publication of atlas shrugged, really articulating her philosophy. so that's what she did. she applied it to politics, to life, to gender, to all these issues from 1957 until she died in 1982. so the objectivism was born out of the later parts of atlas shrugged. yes, definitely. it was there all the time, but it was fleshed out during the latter parts of atlas shrugged and then articulated for the next 20 years. so what is objectivism? so objectivism, so there are five branches in philosophy. and so i'm gonna just go through the branches. she starts with, you start with metaphysics, the nature of reality. and objectivism argues that reality is what it is. it's kind of, it goes, hawkins back to aristotle, law of identity. a is a. you can wish it to be b, but wishes do not make something real. reality is what it is and it is the primary. and it was, it's not manipulated, directed by consciousness. consciousness is there to, you know, to observe, to give us information about reality. that is the purpose of consciousness. that is the nature of it. so in metaphysics, existence exists, the law of identity, the law of causality. things are, you know, the things act based on their nature, not randomly, not arbitrarily, but based on their nature. and then we have the tool to know reality. this is epistemology, the theory of knowledge. a tool to know reality is reason. it's our senses and our capacity to integrate the information we get from our senses and to integrate it into new knowledge and to conceptualize it. and that is uniquely human. we don't know the truth from revelation. we don't know truth from our emotions. our emotions are interesting. our emotions tell us something about ourselves, but our emotions are not tools of cognition. they don't tell us the truth about what's out there, about what's in reality. so reason is our means of knowledge and therefore reason is our means of survival. only individuals reason, just in the same way that only individuals can eat. we don't have a collective stomach. nobody can eat for me. and therefore nobody can think for me. we don't have a collective mind. there's no collective consciousness. it's bizarre that people talk about these collectivized aspects of the mind. they don't talk about collective feats and collective stomachs and collective things. but so we all think for ourselves and it is our fundamental basic responsibility to live our lives. to live, to choose, once we choose to live, to live our lives to the best of our ability. so in morality, she is an egoist. she believes that the purpose of morality is to provide you with a code of values and virtues, to guide your life for the purpose of your own success, your own survival, your own thriving, your own happiness. happiness is the moral purpose of your life. the purpose of morality is to guide you towards a happy life. your own happiness. your own happiness, absolutely. your own happiness. so she rejects the idea that you should live for other people, that you should live for the purpose of other people's happiness. your purpose is not to make them happier, to make them anything. your purpose is your own happiness. but she also rejects the idea that you could argue maybe the nechane idea of you should use other people for your own purposes. so every person is an end in himself. every person's moral responsibility is their own happiness. and you shouldn't use other people for your own, shouldn't exploit other people for your own happiness. and you shouldn't allow yourself to be exploited for other people. every individual is responsible for themselves. and what is it that allows us to be happy? what is it that facilitates human flourishing, human success, human survival? well, it's the use of our minds. it goes back to reason. and what does reason require in order to be successful, in order to work effectively? it requires freedom. so the enemy of reason, the enemy of reason is force. the enemy of reason is coercion. the enemy of reason is authority. the catholic church doing what they did to galileo, that restricts galileo's thinking. when he's in house arrest, is he gonna come up with a new theories, is he gonna discover new truths? no, the punishment is too, it's too dangerous. so force, coercion are enemies of reason. and what reason needs is to be free, to think, to discover, to innovate, to break out of convention. so we need to create an environment in which individuals are free to reason, to free to think. and to do that, we come up with a concept, historically we've come up with a concept of individual rights. individual rights define the scope of, define the fact that we should be left alone, free to pursue our values using our reason, free of what? free of coercion, force, authority. and that the job of government is to make sure that we are free. the whole point of government, the whole point of when we come in a social context, the whole point of establishing a government in that context is to secure that freedom. it's to make sure that i don't use coercion on you. the government is supposed to stop, it's supposed to intervene before i can do that, or if i've already done it, to prevent me from doing it again. so the purpose of government is to protect our freedom to think and to act based on our thoughts. it's to leave individuals free to pursue their values, to pursue their happiness, to pursue their rational thought, and to be left alone to do it. and so she rejects socialism, which basically assumes some kind of collective goal, assumes the sacrifice of the individual to the group, assumes that your moral purpose in life is the well-being of other people rather than your own. and she rejects all form of statism, all form of government that is overly, that is involved in any aspect other than to protect us from force, coercion, authority. and she rejects anarchy, and we can talk about that. i think you had a question in the list of questions you sent me about anarchism. and i'm happy to discuss that. and i just talked to michael malice about anarchy, so i don't know if you're familiar with him. yes, i'm familiar with him. so yeah, so she would completely reject anarchy. anarchy is completely inconsistent with her point of view, and we can talk about why if you want. so there is some perfect place where freedom is maximized, so systems of government that... absolutely, and she thought that the american system of government came close in its idea, obviously founded with original sin, with the sin of slavery, but in its conception, the declaration of independence is about as perfect a political document as one could write, i think the greatest political document in human history, but really articulated almost perfectly and beautifully. and that the american system of government with the chexas balances, with its emphasis on individual rights, with its emphasis on freedom, with its emphasis on leaving individual freedom to pursue their happiness, and the explicit recognition of happiness as a goal, individual happiness, was the model. it wasn't perfect, there were a lot of problems to a large extent because the founders had mixed philosophical premises. so there were alien premises introduced into the founding of the country, slavery obviously being the biggest problem, but it was close. and we need to build on that to create an ideal political system that will, yes, maximize the freedom of individuals to do exactly this. and then of course she had, so that's kind of, that's the manifestation of this individualism in a political realm. and she had a theory of art, she had a theory of aesthetics, which is the fifth branch of, she had metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and politics, and the fifth branch is aesthetics. and she viewed art as an essential human need, a fuel for the human spirit. and that just any human need, it had certain principles that it had to abide by. that is just there's nutrition, right? so some food is good for you and some food is bad for you, some food, some stuff is poison. she believed the same is true of art, that art had an identity, which is very controversial today, right? if you put a frame around it, it is art, right? if you put a urinal in a museum, it becomes art, which she thought was evil and ludicrous, and she rejected completely, that art had an identity and that it served a certain function that human beings needed it. and if it didn't have, not only did it have the identity, but that function was served well by some art and poorly by other art. and then there's a whole realm of stuff that's not art, basically, all of what today is considered modern art, she would consider as not being art, splashing paint on a canvas, not art. so she had very clear ideas. she articulated them not, so i would say not in conventional philosophical form. so she didn't write philosophical essays using the philosopher's language. it's partially why i think philosophers have never taken it seriously. they're actually accessible to us. we can actually read them. and she integrates the philosophy in what i think are amazing ways with psychology, with history, with economics, with politics, with what's going on in the world. and she has dozens and dozens and dozens of essays that she wrote. many of them were aggregated into books. i particularly recommend books the virtue of selfishness, capitalism, the unknown ideal, and philosophy who needs it. and i think it's a beautiful philosophy. i know you're big on love. i think it's a philosophy of love. we can talk about that. essentially, it's about love. that's what the philosophy is all about. and when it apply in terms of applying to self. and i think it's sad that so few people read it and so few intellectuals take it seriously and are willing to engage with it. let me ask, that was incredible. but after that beautiful whirlwind overview, let me ask the most shallow of questions, which is the name objectivism. how should people think about the name being rooted? why not individualism? what are the options? if we're had a branding meeting right now. sure. so she actually had a branding meeting. so she did this. she went through the exercise. objectivism, i do not think, i don't know all the details, but i don't think objectivism was the first name she came with. the problem was that the other names were taken and they were not positive implications. so for example, rationalism could have been a good word because she's an advocate of rational thought or reasonism. but reasonism sounds weird, right? the ism because of too many s's, i guess. rationalism, but it was already a philosophy. and it was a philosophy inconsistent with hers because it was what she considered a false view of reason, of rationality. realityism, you know, just doesn't work. so she came on objectivism. i think actually it's a great word. it's a great name because it has two aspects to it. and this is a unique view of what objectivity actually means. in objectivism, in objectivity is the idea of an independent reality. there is truth. there's actually something out there that we, and then there's the role of consciousness, right? there is the role of figuring out the truth. the truth doesn't just hit you. the truth is not in the thing. you have to discover it. it's that a consciousness applied to, that's what objectivity is, right? it's you discovering the truth in reality. it's your consciousness interacting. and thereby posing the individual in that sense. and only the individual could do it. now the problem with individualism is it would have made the philosophy too political, right? and she always said, so she said, she said, i'm an advocate of capitalism because i'm really an advocate for rational egoism. but i'm an advocate for rational egoism, really because i'm an advocate for reason. so she viewed the essential of her philosophy as being this reason and her particular view of reason. she has a whole book. there's a book called, introduction to objectivist epistemology, which i encourage any scientist, mathematician, anybody interested in science to read, because it is a tour de force on, in a sense, what it means to hold concepts and what it means to discover new discoveries and to use concepts and how we use concepts. and she has a theory of concepts that is completely new, that is completely revolutionary. and i think is essential for the philosophy of science. and therefore ultimately for the more abstract we get with scientific discoveries, the easier it is to detach them from reality and to detach them from truth, the easier it is to be inside our heads instead of about what's real. and there are probably examples from modern physics that fit that. and i think what she teaches in the book is how to ground your concepts and how to bring them into grounding in reality. so introduction to objectivist epistemology, and note that it's only an introduction because one of the things she realized, one of the things that i think a lot of her critics don't give enough credit for, is the philosophy is, there's no end, right? it's always growing. there are always new discoveries. there's always, it's science. there's always new things. and there's a ton of work to do. in philosophy, and particularly in epistemology and the theory of knowledge, she was actually, given your interest in mathematics, she actually saw a lot of parallels between math and concept formation. and she was actually, in the years before she died, she was taking private lessons in mathematics, in algebra and calculus, because she believed that there was real insight in understanding algebra in calculus to philosophy, into epistemology. and she also was very interested in neuroscience because she believed that that had a lot to tell us about epistemology, but also about music, therefore about aesthetics. so, i mean, she recognized the importance of all these different fields and how, and the beauty of philosophy is it should be integrating all of them. and one of the sad things about the world in which we live is, again, we view these things as silos. we don't view them as integrating. we don't have teams of people from different arena, different fields, discovering things. we become ants, specialized. so, she was definitely that, and she was constantly curious, constantly interested in new discoveries and new ideas and how this could expand the scope of her philosophy and application of her philosophy. there's a million topics i could talk to you, but since you mentioned math, i'm almost- we only got three hours. you know what i'm saying? i'm almost curious. i don't know if you're familiar with gale's incompleteness theorem. i'm not, unfortunately. okay, it was a powerful proof that any axiomatic systems, when you start from a bunch of axioms, that there will, in that system, provably must be an inconsistency. so, that was this painful stab in the idea of mathematics that if we start with a set of assumptions, kind of i had started with objectivism, there will have to be at least one contradiction. see, i intuitively am gonna say that's false. philosophically, but in math, it's just true. and that's- it's a question about how you define, again, definitions matter, and you have to be careful on how you define axioms, and you have to be careful about what you define as an inconsistency and what that means to say there's an inconsistency. and i don't know, i'm not gonna say more than that because i don't know, but i'm suspicious that there is some, and this is the power of philosophy, and this is why i said before, concept formation is so important, and understanding concept formation is so important, for particularly, again, mathematics, because it's such an abstract field, and it's so easy to lose grounding in reality, that if you properly define axioms, and you properly define what you're doing in math, whether that is true, and i don't think it is. this is, yeah, we'll leave it as an open mystery because actually this audience, there's literally over 100,000 people that have phds, and so they know gaito's the compliance theorem. i have this intuition that there is something different between mathematics and philosophy that i'd love to hear from people. like what exactly is that difference? because there's a precision to mathematics that philosophy doesn't have, but that precision gets you in trouble. it somehow, it actually takes you away from truth. like the very constraints of the language used in mathematics actually puts a constraint on the capture of truth that it's able to do. i'm gonna argue that that is a total product of the way you're conceptualizing the terms within mathematics. it's not in reality. yeah, so you would argue it's in the fact that mathematics, inasmuch as it's detached from reality, that you can do these kinds of things. yes, and that mathematicians have come up with concepts that they haven't grounded in reality properly that allows them to go off in places that don't lead to truth. that's right, that don't lead to truth. but i encourage you then, i encourage you to do one of these podcasts with one of our philosophers who know more about this stuff. and if you move to austin, i've got somebody i'd recommend to you. can you throw a name out or no? yeah, i mean, i would talk to greg solmieri. when you say our, can you say what you mean by our? i'd say people who are affiliated with the ironman institute are philosophers who are affiliated with objectivism. right, and greg is one of our brightest, and he's in austin, he's just got a position at ut, at the university of texas. and he would want, ankar ghatia would be another one who actually works at the institute and a chief philosophy officer at the institute. that's awesome. and there are others who specialize in philosophy of science, who i think greg could probably give you a lead. but these are unbelievably smart people who know this part of the philosophy much better than i do. can you just briefly perhaps say, what is the ironman institute? yeah, so the ironman institute was an organization founded three years after ironman died. she died in 1982. and it was founded in 1985 to promote her ideas, to make sure that her ideas and her novels continued in the culture and were relevant. well, they're relevant, but the people saw the relevance. so our mission is to get people to read her books, to engage in the ideas. we teach, we have the objectivist academic center where we teach the philosophy, primarily to graduate students and others who take the idea seriously and who really want a deep understanding of the philosophy. and we apply the ideas. so we take the ideas and apply them to ethics, to philosophy, to issues of the day, which is more my strength and more what i tend to do. i've never formally studied philosophy. so all my education philosophy is informal and i'm an engineer and a finance guy. that's my background. so i'm a nobody's guy. well, i feel pretty under educated, i have a pretty open mind, which sometimes can be painful on the internet because people mock me or, if i say something nuanced about communism, people immediately kind of put you in a bin or something that. it hurts to be open-minded to say, i don't know, to ask the question, why is communism or marxism so problematic? why is capitalism problematic and so on? but let me nevertheless go into that direction with you. maybe let's talk about capitalism a little bit. how does objectivism compare, relate to the idea of capitalism? well, first we have to define what capitalism is. because again, people use capitalism in all kinds of ways. and i know you had ray dalio on your show once. i need to listen to that episode. but ray has no clue what capitalism is and that's his big problem. so when he says there are real problems today in capitalism, he's not talking about capitalism. he's talking about problems in the world today. and i agree with many of the problems, but they have nothing to do with capitalism. capitalism is a social, political, economic system in which all property is privately owned and in which the only role of government is the protection of individual rights. i think it's the ideal system. i think it's the right system for the reasons we talked about earlier. it's a system that leaves you as an individual to pursue your values, your life, your happiness, free of coercion and force. and you get to decide what happens to you. and i get to decide if to help you or not. let's say you fall flat on your face. people always say, well, what about the poor? well, if you care about the poor, help them. just don't, what do you need a government for? i always ask audiences, okay, if there's a poor kid who can't afford to go to school and all the schools are private because capitalism is being instituted and he can't go to school, would you be willing to participate in a fund that pays for his education? every hand in the room goes up. so what do you need government for? just let's get all the money together and pay for his schooling. so the point is that what capitalism does is leave individuals free to make their own decisions. and as long as they're not violating other people's rights, in other words, as long as they're not using coercion force on other people, then leave them alone. and people are going to make mistakes and people are gonna screw up their lives and people are gonna commit suicide. people are gonna do terrible things to themselves. that is fundamentally their problem. and if you want to help, you under capitalism are free to help. it's just the only thing that doesn't happen under capitalism is you don't get to impose your will on other people. how's that a bad thing? so the question then is how does the implementation of capitalism deviate from its ideal in practice? i mean, this is what is the question with a lot of systems is how does it start to then fail? so one thing maybe you can correct me or inform me, it seems information is very important. like being able to make decisions, to be free, you have to have access, full access of all the information you need to make rational decisions. no, that can't be right. because it can't be right. because none of us has full access to all the information we need. i mean, what does that even mean? and how much of the scope do you wanna do? let's just start there, yeah. so you need to have access to information. so one of the big criticisms of capitalism is this asymmetrical information. the drug maker has more information about the drug than the drug buyer, right? pharmaceutical drugs. true, it's a problem. well, i wonder if one can think about, an entrepreneur can think about how to solve that problem. see, i view any one of these challenges to capitalism as an opportunity for entrepreneurs to make money. and they have the freedom to do it. yeah, so imagine an entrepreneur steps in and says, i will test all the drugs that drug companies make, and i will provide you for a fee with the answer. and how do i know he's not gonna be corrupted? well, there'll be other ones and they'll compete. and who am i to tell which one of these is the right one? well, it won't be you really getting the information from them, it'll be your doctor. the doctors need that information. so the doctor who has some expertise in medicine will be evaluating which rating agency to use to evaluate the drugs and which ones then to recommend to you. so do we need an fda? do we need a government that siphons all the information to one source that does all the research, all the things, and has a clear incentive, by the way, not to approve drugs. there's no, because they don't make any money from it. nobody pays them for the information, nobody pays them to be accurate. they're bureaucrats at the end of the day. and what is a bureaucrat, what's the main focus of a bureaucrat? even if they go in with the best of intentions, which i'm sure all the scientists at the fda have the best of intentions, what's their incentive? the system builds in this incentive, not to screw up. because one drug gets value and does damage, you lose your job. but if 100 drugs that could cure cancer tomorrow don't ever get to market, nobody's gonna come after you. yeah, and you're saying that's not a mechanism that's conducive to- you see, the marketplace is competition. so if you won't approve the drug, if i still think it's possible, i will, and it's not zero one. you see, the other thing that happens with the fda is it's zero one. it's either approved or it's not approved. or it's approved for this, but it's not approved for that. but what if a drug came out and you said, right, you told the doctors, this drug in 10 of the cases can cause patients an increased risk of heart disease? you and your patients should. we're not forcing you, but you should, right? it's your medical responsibility to evaluate that and decide if the drug is appropriate or not. why don't i get to make that choice if i want to take on the 10 risk of heart disease? so there was a drug, and right now i forget the name, but it was a drug against pain, particularly for arthritic pain. and it worked. it reduced pain dramatically, right? and some people tried everything, and this was the only drug that reduced their pain. and it turned out that in 10 of the cases, it caused the elevated risk. it didn't kill people necessarily, but it caused elevated risk of heart disease. okay, what did the fda do? it banned the drug. some people, i know a lot of people who said, living with pain is much worse than taking on a 10 risk. again, probabilities, right? people don't think in those numbers. 10 risk of maybe getting heart disease. why don't i get to make that choice? why does some bureaucrat make that choice for me? that's capitalism. capitalism gives you the choice, not you as an ignorant person, you with your doctor and a whole marketplace, which is not created to provide you with information. and think about a world where we didn't have all these regulations and controls. the amount of opportunities that would exist to create, to provide information, to educate you about that information would mushroom dramatically. bloomberg, the billionaire bloomberg, how did he make his money? he made his money by providing financial information, by creating this service called bloomberg, where you buy a terminal and you get all this amazing information and he was before computers, desktop computers. i mean, he was very early on in that whole computing revolution, but his focus was providing financial information to professionals. and you hire a professional to manage your money. that's the way it's supposed to be. you know, you have to have, so you as an individual cannot have all the knowledge you need in medicine, all the knowledge you need in finance, all the knowledge you need in every aspect of your life. you can't do that. you have to delegate and you hire a doctor. now you should be able to figure out if the doctor's good or not. you should be able to ask doctors for reasons for why you have to make the decision at the end. but that's why you have a doctor. it's why you have a financial advisor. that's why you have different people who you're delegating certain aspects of your life too, but you want choices. and what the marketplace provides is those choices. so let's, let me then, this is what i do. i'll make a dumb case for things and then you shut me down and then the internet says how dumb lex is. this is good. this is how it works. i'm good at shutting down. and they're foolish in blaming you for the question because you're here to ask me questions. let's make the, let me make a case for socialism. so. it's gonna be bad because that's the only case there is for socialism. that's reality. so perhaps it's not a case for socialism, but just a certain notion that inequality, the wealth inequality that the bigger the gap between the poorest or the average and the richest, the more painful it is to be average. psychologically speaking, if you know that there is the ceos of companies make 300, a thousand, one million times more than you do, that makes life for a large part of the population less fulfilling. that there's a relative notion to the experience of our life. that even though everybody's life has gotten better over the past decades and centuries, it may feel actually worse because you know that life could be so, so much better in life to the ceos that, yeah, that gap is fundamentally a thing that is undesirable in a society. everything about that is wrong. i to start off that. so, i mean, so my wife likes to remind me that as well as we've done in life, we are actually from a wealth perspective closer to a homeless person than we are to bill gates. just the math, right? just the math, right? it's a good ego check. when i look at bill gates, i get a smile on my face. i love bill gates. i've never met bill gates. i love bill gates. yeah. i love what he stands for. i love that he has a hundred billion dollars. i love that he has built a trampoline room in his house where his kids can jump up and down in a trampoline in a safe environment. can we take another billionaire? because i'm not sure if you're paying attention, but there's all kinds of conspiracy theories about bill gates. well, but that's part of the story, right? they have to pull him down because people resent him for other reasons. that's strange. but yes, we can take jeff bezos. we can take my favorite, historically, just because i a lot about him was steve jobs. i mean, i love these people. and i can't, there are very few billionaires i don't love. in the sense that i appreciate everything they've done for me, for people i cherish and love, they've made the world a better place. why would it ever cross my mind that they make me look bad because they're richer than me or that i don't have what they have? they've made me so much richer, that they've made inventions that used to cost millions and millions and millions of dollars accessible to me. i mean, this is a supercomputer in my pocket. now, but think about it, right? what is the difference between, and i'll get to the essence of your point in a minute, but think about what the difference is between me and bill gates in terms of, because it's true that in terms of wealth, i'm closer to the homeless person. but in terms of my day-to-day life, i'm closer to bill gates. you know, we both live in a nice house. his is nicer, but we live in a nice house. his is bigger, but mine is plenty big. we both drive cars. his is nicer, but we both drive cars. cars, 100 years ago, what cars? we both can fly, get on a plane in los angeles and fly to new york and get there in about the same time. we're both flying private. the only difference is my private plane i share with 300 other people. and his, but it's accessible. it's relatively comfortable, again, in the perspective of 50 years ago, 100 years ago. it's unimaginable that i could fly that for such a low fee. we live very similar lives in that sense. so i don't resent him. so first of all, i'm an exception to the supposed rule that people resent. i don't think anybody, i don't think people do resent unless they're taught to resent. and this is the key. people are taught. and i've seen this in america. and this is, to me, the most horrible, shocking thing that has happened in america over the last 40 years. i came to america, so i'm an immigrant. i came to america from israel in 1987. and i came here because i thought this was the place where i could, where it had the most opportunities. and it is, most opportunities. and i came here because i believed there was a certain american spirit of individualism and exactly the opposite of what you just described, a sense of i live my life. it's my happiness. i'm not looking at my neighbor. i'm not competing with the joneses. the american dream is my dream, my two kids, my dog, my station wagon, not because other people have it, it's because i want it. and that sense, and when i came here in the 80s, you had that. you had, you still had it. it was less than i think it had been in the past. but you had that spirit. there was no envy. there was no resentment. there were rich people and they were celebrated. there was still this admiration for entrepreneurs and admiration for success, not by everybody, certainly not by the intellectuals, but by the average person. i have witnessed, particularly over the last 10 years, a complete transformation, and america's become europe. i know, are you russian? yeah. it's become russian in a sense where, they've always done these studies. i'll give you a hundred dollars and your neighbor a hundred dollars or give you, what is it? or give you a thousand dollars, but your neighbor gets $10,000. and a russian will always choose the a hundred dollars. he wants equality above being better with himself. americans would always choose that gap. and that's changing. my sense is not anymore. and it's changing because we've been told it should change. and morally you're saying that doesn't make any sense. so there's no sense in which, let me put another spin. i forget the book, but the sense of, if you're working for steve jobs and you, your hands, you're the engineer behind the iphone. and there's a sense in which his salary is stealing from your efforts because, i forget the book, right? that's literally the terminology is used. this is straight out of karl marx. sure. it's also straight, but out of karl marx. but there's no sense, morally speaking, that you see that as the other way around. that engineer is stealing off of, and it's not stealing. it's not, but the engineer is getting more from steve jobs by a lot, not by a little bit, than steve jobs is getting from the engineer. the engineer, even if they're a great engineer, there probably are other great engineers that could replace him. would he even have a job without steve jobs? would the industry exist without steve jobs? without the giants that carry these things forward? let me ask you this. i mean, you're a scientist. do you resent einstein for being smarter than you? i mean, and v.m., are you angry with him? would you feel negative towards him if he was in the room right now? or would you, if he came into the room, you'd say, my god. i mean, you interview people who i think some of them are probably smarter than you and me. yeah, for sure. and your attitude towards them is one of reverence. well, one interesting little side question there is what is the natural state of being for us humans? you kind of implied education, has polluted our minds, but if i, because you're referring to jealousy. the einstein question, the steve jobs question, i wonder which way, if we're left without education, would we naturally go? so there is no such thing as the natural state in that sense, right? this is the myth of who sows noble savage and of john walls' behind the scenes and of john walls' behind the veil of ignorance. well, if you're ignorant, you're ignorant. you can't make any decisions, you're just ignorant. there is no human nature that determines how you will relate to other people. you will relate to other people based on the conclusions you come to about how to relate to other people. you can relate to other people as values, to use your terminology, from the perspective of love. this other human being is a value to me and i want to trade with them and trade the beauty of trade is it's win-win. i wanna benefit and they are going to benefit. i don't wanna screw them, i don't want them to screw me. i want this to be win-win. or you can deal with other people as threats, as enemies. much of human history, we have done that. and therefore, as a zero-sum world, what they have, i want. i will take it, i will use force to take it. i will use political force to take it. i will use the force of my arm to take it. i will just take it. so those are two options, right? and they will determine whether we live in civilization or not. and they are determined by conclusions people come to about the world and the nature of reality and the nature of morality and the nature of politics and all these things. they are determined by philosophy. and this is why philosophy is so important because philosophy shapes, evolution doesn't do this. it doesn't just happen. ideas shape how we relate to other people. and you say, well, little children do it. well, little children don't have a frontal cortex. it's not relevant, right? what happens as you develop a frontal cortex, as you develop the brain, you learn ideas. and those ideas will shape how you relate to other people. and if you learn good ideas, you relate to other people in a healthy, productive win-win. and if you develop bad ideas, you will resent other people and you will want their stuff. and the thing is that human progress depends on the win-win relationship. it depends on civilization, depends on peace. it depends on allowing people, going back to what we talked about earlier, allowing people the freedom to think for themselves. and anytime you try to interrupt that, you're causing damage. so this change in america is not some reversion to a natural state. it's a shift in ideas. we still live, the better part of american society and the world still lives on the remnants of the enlightenment, the enlightenment ideas. the ideas that brought about this scientific revolution. the ideas that brought about the creation of this country. and it's the same basic ideas that led to both of those. and as those ideas get more distant, as those ideas are not defended, as those ideas disappear, as enlightenment goes away, we will become more violent, more resentful, more tribal, more obnoxious, more unpleasant, more primitive. a very specific example of this that bothers me, i'd be curious to get your comment on. so elon musk is a billionaire. and one of the things that really, maybe it's almost a pet peeve, it really bothers me when the press and the general public will say, well, all those rockets they're sending up there, those are just the toys, the games that billionaires play. that to me, billionaire has become a dirty word to use, as if money can buy or has anything to do with genius. like i'm trying to articulate a specific line of question here because it just bothers me. i guess the question is , how do we get here and how do we get out of that? because elon musk is doing some of the most incredible things that a human being has ever participated in. mostly, he doesn't build the rockets himself, he's getting a bunch of other geniuses together that have- that takes genius. that takes genius. but where did we go and how do we get back to where elon musk is an inspiring figure as opposed to a billionaire playing with some toys? so this is the role of philosophy. it goes back to the same place. it goes back to our understanding of the world and our role in it. and if you understand that the only way to become a billionaire, for example, is to create value. value for whom? value for people who are gonna consume it. the only way to become a billionaire, the only way elon musk became a billionaire is through paypal. now paypal is something we all use. paypal is an enormous value to all of us. it's why it's worth several billions of dollars, which elon musk could then, you know, earn. but you cannot become a billionaire in a free society by exploiting people. you cannot because you'll be laughed, nobody will deal with you. nobody will have any interactions with you. the only way to become a billionaire is to do billions of win-win transactions. so the only way to become a billionaire in a free society is to change the world to make it a better place. billionaires are the great humanitarians of our time, not because they give charity, but because they make them billions. and it's true that money and genius are not necessarily correlated. but you cannot become a billionaire without being super smart. you cannot become a billionaire by figuring something out that nobody else has figured out in whatever realm it happens to be. and that thing that you figure out has to be something that provides immense value to other people. where do we go wrong? we go wrong, our culture goes wrong because it views billionaires as self-interested, as selfish. and there's a sense in which, and not a sense, it's absolutely true. the billionaire doesn't ask for my opinion on what product to launch. elon musk doesn't ask others what they think you should spend his money on, what the greatest social wellbeing will be. i mean, there's a sense in which the rockets are his toys. there's a sense in which he chose that he would be inspired the most. he would have the most fun by going to mars and building rockets. and he's probably dreamt of rockets from when he was a kid and probably always played with rockets. and now he has the funds, the capital to be able to deploy. so he's being selfish. obviously, he's being self-interested. this is what elon musk is about. i mean, the same with jeff bezos. there's no committee to decide whether to invent, you know, to invest in cloud computing or not. bezos decided that. and at the end of the day, they are the bosses. they pursue the values they believe are good. they create the wealth. it's their decisions, it's their mind. and the fact is we live in a world where for 2000 plus years, self-interest, even though we all do it, to small extent or the less, we deem it as morally abhorrent. it's bad, it's wrong. i mean, your mother probably taught you the same thing my mother taught me. think of others first, think of yourself last. the good stuff is kept for the guests. you never get to use the good stuff. you know, it's others. that's what the focus of morality is. now, no mother, even no jewish mother, actually believes that, right? because they don't really want you to be last. they want you to be first and they push you to be first. but morally, they've been taught their entire lives and they believe that the right thing to say and to some extent do is to argue for sacrifice for other people, right? so most people, 99 of people are torn. they know they should be selfless, sacrifice, live for other people. they don't really want to, so they act selfishly in their day-to-day life and they feel guilty and they can't be happy. they can't be happy and jewish mothers and catholic mothers are excellent at using that guilt to manipulate you. but the guilt is inevitable because you've got these two conflicting things, the way you want to live and the way you've been taught to live. and what objectivism does is that at the end of the day, provides you with a way to unite morality, a proper morality with what you want and to think about what you really want, to conceptualize what you really want properly. so what you want is really good for you and what you want will really lead to your happiness. so we reject the idea of sacrifice. we reject the idea of living for other people. but you see, if you believe that the purpose of morality is to sacrifice for other people and you look at jeff bezos, when was the last time he sacrificed anything? he's living pretty well. he's got billions, he could give it all away and yet he doesn't. how dare he? in my talks, i often position, and i'm gonna use vought gates, sorry guys, vought to conspiracy theory, bs, complete and utter nonsense. there's not a shred of truth. i disagree with bill gates on everything political. i think he politically is a complete ignoramus, but the guy's a genius when it comes to technology and he's just thoughtful even in this philanthropy. he just uses his mind and i respect that, even though politically he's terrible. anyway, think about this. who had a bigger impact on the lives of poor people in the world? bill gates or mother teresa? bill gates. it's not even close. and mother teresa lived this altruistic life to the core. she lived it consistently. and yet she was miserable, pathetic, horrible. she hated her life. she was miserable. and most of the people she helped didn't do very well because she just helped them not die. and then bill gates changed the world and he helped a lot by providing technology. we even, philanthropy gets to them. the food gets to them, that's fair, it's more efficient. yet who is the moral saint? sainthood is not determined based on what you do for other people. sainthood is based on how much pain you suffer. i to ask people to go to a museum and look at all the paintings of saints. how many of them are smiling and are happy? they've used to got arrows through them and holes in their body and they're just suffering a horrible death. the whole point of the morality we are taught is that happiness is immorality, that happy people cannot be good people and that good people suffer and that suffering is necessary for morality. morality is about sacrifice, self-sacrifice and suffering. and at the end of the day, almost all the problems in the world boil down to that false view. so can we try to talk about, part of it is the problem of the word selfishness. but let's talk about the virtue of selfishness. so let's start at the fact that for me, i really enjoy doing stuff for other people. i enjoy being, cheering on the success of others. why? i don't know. it's deep in the- well think about it. why? because i think you do know. if i were to really think, i don't wanna resort to evolutionary arguments or this is somehow- no, some of us are evolutionary. so i think- so i can tell you why i enjoy helping others. well, maybe you can go there. one thing, because we should talk about love a little bit, i'll tell you, there's a part of me that's a little bit not rational. there's a gut that i follow that not everything i do is perfectly rational. for example, my dad criticizes me. he says , you should always have a plan. like it should make sense. you have a strategy. and i say that, i stepped down from my full salary position at mit. there's so many things i did without a plan. it's a gut. it's , i wanna start a company. well, you know how many companies fail? i don't know. it's a gut. and the same thing with being kind to others is a gut. i watch the way that karma works in this world, that the people us, one guy i look up to is joe rogan, that he does stuff for others. and that the joy he experiences, the way he sees the world, just the glimmer in his eyes because he does stuff for others that creates a joyful experience. and that somehow seems to be an instructive way to, that to me is inspiring of a life well lived. but you probably know a lot of people who have done stuff for others who are not happy. true. so i don't think it's the doing stuff for others that brings the happiness. it's why you do stuff for others and what else you're doing in your life and what is the proportion. but it's why at the end of the day, which is, and it's the same. look, you can maybe through a gut feeling say i wanna start a company, but you better start doing thinking about how and what and all of that. and to some extent the why, because if you really wanna be happy doing this, you better make sure you're doing it for the right reason. so i'm not, there's something called fast thinking, coleman, the... daniel coleman. yes, daniel coleman talks about, and it's, all the integrations you've made so far in your life cause you to have specialized knowledge and certain things and you can think very fast and your gut tells you what the right answer is. but it's not, your mind is constantly evaluating and constantly working. you wanna make it as rational as you can, not in the sense that i have to think through every time i make a decision, but that they've so programmed my mind in a sense that the answers are the right answers when i get them. so, i , i view other people as a value. other people contribute enormously to my life, whether it's a romantic love relationship or whether it's a friendship relationship or whether it's just, jeff bezos creating amazon and delivering goodies to my home when i get them. and people do all that, right? it's not just jeff bezos, he gets the most credit but everybody in that chain of command, everybody at amazon is working for me. i love that. i love the idea of a human being. i love the idea that there are people capable of being an einstein, of being, and creating and building and making stuff that makes my life so good. you know, most of us , this is not a good room for an example, most of us plants, right? we pets. i don't particularly, but people pets, why? we'd to see life. human beings are life on steroids, right? they're life with a brain. it's amazing, right? what they can do. i love people. now, that doesn't mean i love everybody because there's some, there are really bad people out there who i hate, right? and i do hate. and there are people out there that are just, i have no opinion about, but generally, the idea of a human being to me is a phenomenal idea. when i see a baby, i light up because to me, there's a potential, you know, there's this magnificent potential that is embodied in that. and when i see people struggling and need help, i think they're human beings. they, you know, they embody that potential. they embody that goodness. they might turn out to be bad, but why would i ever give the presumption of that? i give them the presumption of the positive and i cheer them on. and i enjoy watching people succeed. i enjoy watching people get to the top of the mountain and produce something. even if i don't get anything directly from it, i enjoy that because it's part of my enjoyment of life. so the word, see, to you, the morality of selfishness, this kind of love of other human beings, the love of life fits into a morality of selfishness. can't not because it's, there's no context in which you can truly love yourself without loving life and loving what it means to be human. so, you know, the love of yourself is gonna manifest itself definitely in different people, but it's core. what do you love about yourself? first of all, i love, i love that i'm alive. i love that, you know, i love this world and the opportunities it provides me and the fun and the excitement of discovering something new and meeting a new person and having a conversation. you know, all of this is immensely enjoyable, but behind all of that is a particular human capability that not only i have, other people have. and the fact that they have it makes my life so much more fun because, so it's, you cannot view, you know, it's all integrated and you cannot view yourself in isolation. now that doesn't, that doesn't place a moral commandment on me. help everybody who's poor that you happen to meet in the street. it doesn't place a burden on me in a sense that now i have this moral duty to help everybody. it leaves me free to make decisions about who i help and who i don't. there's some people who i will not help. there's some people who i do not wish positive things upon. bad people should have bad outcomes. bad people should suffer. so- and then you have the freedom to choose who's good, who's bad within your- it's your decision based on your values. now i think there's an objectivity to it. there's a standard by which you should evaluate good versus bad and that standard should be to what extent do they contribute or hurt human life. the standard is human life. and so when i say, look at the jeff bezos, i say he's contributed to human life, good guy. i might disagree with him on stuff. we might disagree about politics. we might disagree about women. i don't know what we agree. but overall, big picture, he is pro-life. i look at somebody , you know, to take 99.9 of our politicians and they are pro-death. they are pro-destruction. they are pro-cutting corners in ways that destroy human life and human potential and human ability. so i literally hate almost every politician out there. and i wish ill on them, right? i don't want them to be successful or happy. i want them all to go away, right? leave me alone. so i believe in justice. i believe good things should happen to good people and bad things should happen to bad people. so i make those generalizations based on this one, you know, on the other hand, i shouldn't say all politicians, right? so if i, you know, i love thomas jefferson and george washington, right? i love abraham lincoln. i love people who fought for freedom and who believed in freedom, who had these ideas and who lived up to, at least in parts of their lives, to those principles. now, do i think thomas jefferson was flawed because he held slaves? absolutely. but the virtues way outweigh that in my view. and i understand people who don't accept that. you don't have to also love and hate the entirety of the person, this part of that person that you're attracting. the major part is pro-life and therefore i'm pro that person. and i think, and i said earlier that objectivism is philosophy of love. and i believe that because objectivism is about your life, about loving your life, about embracing your life, about engaging with the world, about loving the world in which you live, about win-win relationships with other people, which means to a large extent, loving the good in other people and the best in other people and encouraging that and supporting that and promoting that. so i know selfishness is a harsh word because the culture has given it that harshness. selfishness is a harsh word because the people who don't selfishness want you to believe it's a harsh word. but it's not. what does it mean? it means focus on self. it means take care of self. it means make yourself your highest priority, not your only priority, because in taking care of self, what would i be without my wife? what would i be without the people who support me, who help me, who i have these love relationships with? so other people are crucial. what would my life be without steve jobs? a lot of things you mentioned here are just beautiful. so one is win-win. so one key thing about this selfishness and the idea of objectivism is the philosophy of love is that you don't want parasitism. so that is unethical. so you actually, first of all, you say win-win a lot, and i just that terminology because it's a good way to see life. it's try to maximize the number of win-win interactions. that's a good way to see business, actually. well, life generally. i think every aspect of life, you want to have a win-win relationship with your wife. imagine if it was win-lose. either way, if you win and she loses, how long is that going to sustain? so win-lose relationships are not in equilibrium. what they turn into is lose-lose. win-lose turns into lose-lose. so the only alternative to lose-lose is win-win. and you win and the person you love wins. what's better than that? that's the way to maximize. so the selfishness is you're trying to maximize the win, but the way to maximize the win is to maximize the win-win. yes, and it turns out, and adam smith understood this a long time ago, that if you focus on your own winning while respecting other people as human beings, then everybody wins. and the beauty of capitalism, if we go back to capitalism for a second, the beauty of capitalism is you cannot be successful in capitalism without producing values that other people appreciate and therefore willing to buy from you. and they buy them, and this goes back to that question about the engineer and steve jobs. why is the engineer working there? because he's getting paid more than his time is worth to him. i know people don't to think in those terms, but that's the reality. if his time is worth more to him than what he's getting paid, he would leave. so he's winning. and is apple winning? yes, because they're getting more productivity from him, they're getting more from him than what he's actually producing. it's tough because there's human psychology and imperfect information. it just makes it a little messier than the clarity of thinking you have about this. it's just, you know, because for sure, but not everything in life is an economic transaction. it ultimately is close, but- even if it's not an economic transaction, even if it's a relationship transaction, when you get to a point with a friend where you're not gaining from the relationship, friendship's gonna be over. not immediately, because it takes time for these things to manifest itself and to really absorb into. but we change friendships, we change our loves, right? we fall in and out of love. we fall out of love because we're not, love, so let's go back to love. love is the most selfish of all emotions. love is about what you do to me, right? so i love my wife because she makes me feel better about myself. so, you know, the idea of selfless love is bizarre. so ayn rand used to say, before you say i love you, you have to say the i. and you have to know who you are and you have to appreciate yourself. if you hate yourself, what does it mean to love somebody else? so i love my wife because she makes me feel great about the world. and she lives me for the same reason. and so ayn rand used to use this example. imagine you go up to your, to be spoused the night before the wedding and you say, you know, i get nothing out of this relationship. i'm doing this purely as an act of noble self-sacrifice. she would slap you, as she should, right? so, no, we know this intuitively that love is selfish, but we are afraid to admit it to ourselves and why? because the other side has convinced us that selfishness is associated with exploiting other people. selfishness means lying, cheating, stealing, walking on corpses, backstabbing people. but is that ever in your self-interest? truly, right? you know, i'll often be in front of an audience to say, okay, how many people here have lied? i'm kidding, right? how many of you think that, that if you did that consistently, that would make your life better? nobody thinks that, right? because everybody's experienced how shitty lying, not because of how it makes you feel out of a sense of guilt. existentially, it's just a bad strategy, right? you get caught, you have to create other lies to cover up the previous lie. it screws up with your own psychology and your own cognition. you know, the mind, to some extent, a computer, right, is an integrating machine. and in computer science, i understand there's a term called garbage in, garbage out. lying is garbage in. yeah, so it's not good strategy, cheating, screwing your customers in a business, not paying your suppliers as a businessman, not good business practices, not good practices for being alive. so win-win is both moral and practical, and the beauty of iron man's philosophy, and i think this is really important, is that the moral is the practical and the practical is the moral. and therefore, if you are moral, you will be happy. yeah, that's why the application of the philosophy of objectivism is so easy to practice, so , or to discuss, or possible to discuss. that's why you talk about all- i'm so clear cut. i'm not ambiguous about my view. and it's fundamentally practical. i mean, that's the best of philosophy, is practical. it's, in a sense, teaching you how to live a good life, and it's teaching you how to live a good life, not just as you, but as a human being. and therefore, the principles that apply to you probably apply to me as well. and if we both share the same principles of how to live a good life, we're not gonna be enemies. you brought up anarchy earlier. it's an interesting question, because you've kind of said politicians, i mean, part of it is a little bit joking, but politicians are not good people. but we should have some. so you have an opposition to anarchism. so they, first of all, they weren't always not bad people. that is, i gave examples of people who engaged in political life or i think were good people, basically. and, but they think they get worse over time if the system is corrupt. and i think the system, unfortunately, even the american system, as good as it was, was founded on quicksand and have corruption built in. they didn't quite get it. and they needed ayn rand to get it, because i'm not blaming them. i don't think they share any blame. you needed a philosophy in order to completely fulfill the promise that is america, as a promise that is the founding of america. so the place where the corruption sneaked in is the lack in some way of the philosophy underlying the nation? absolutely. so it's christianity. it's, you know, not to hit on another controversial topic. it's religion, which undercut their morality. so the founders were explicitly christian and altruistic in their morality. implicitly, in terms of their actions, they were completely secular, and they were very secular anyway. but in their morality, even, they were secular. so there's nothing in christianity that says that you have an inalienable right to pursue happiness. that's unbelievably self-interested and based on kind of a moral philosophy of an egoistic moral philosophy. but they didn't know that. and they didn't know how to ground it. they implicitly, they had that fast thinking, that gut, that told them that this was right. and the whole enlightenment, that period from john locke on to really to hume, that period is about pursuit of happiness, using reason in pursuit of the good life, right? but they can't ground it. they don't really understand what reason is, and they don't really understand what happiness requires. and they can't detach themselves from christianity. they're not allowed to politically. and i think conceptually, you just can't make that big break. rand is an enlightenment thinker in that sense. she is what should have followed right after, right? she should have come there and grounded them in the secular and in the egoistic and aristotelian view of morality as a code of values to basically to guide your life, to guide your life towards happiness. that's aristotle's view, right? so they didn't have that. so i think that government is necessary. it's not a necessary evil, it's a necessary good because it does something good. and the good that it does is it eliminates coercion from society, it eliminates violence from society, it eliminates the use of force between individuals from society. and that- i see the argument that michael malice would make. i know. give me a chance here. yeah. is why can't you apply the same kind of reasoning that you've effectively used for the rest of mutually agreed upon institutions that are driven by capitalism that we can't also hire forces to protect us from the violence, to ensure the stability of society that protects us from the violence. why draw the line at this particular place, right? well, because there is no other place to draw a line and there is a line. and by the way, we draw lines other places, right? we don't vote, we don't have, we don't determine truth in science based in competition. right, so that's a line. but first off, some people might say, i mean, there's competition in a sense that you have alternate theories, but at the end of the day, whether you decide that this he's right or he's right is not based on the market, it's based on facts, on reality, on objective reality. you have to, and some people will never accept that this person is right because they don't see the stream. so first of all, what they reject, what most anarchists reject, even if they don't admit it, even if they don't admit it or recognize it, is they reject objective reality. in what sense? so , okay. so there's a whole, so the whole realm of law is a scientific realm to define, for example, the boundaries of private property. it's not an issue of competition. it's not an issue of i have one system and you have another system. it's an issue of objective reality. and now it's more difficult than science in a sense because it's more difficult to prove that my conception of property is correct and you're correct. but there is a correct one. in reality, there's a correct vision. it's more abstract. but look, somebody has to decide what property is. so i have, i have defined, my property is defined by certain boundaries. and i have a police force and i have a judiciary system that backs my vision. and you have a claim against my property. you have a claim against my property. and you have a police force and a judicial system that backs your claim. who's right? so our definitions of property are different? yes, our definitions of property all are cloned. our claim on the property is different. so why can't we just agree on the definition of property? but why should we agree? your judicial system is one definition of property. my judicial system is not. you think that there's no such thing as intellectual property rights and your whole system believes that. and my whole system believes there is such thing. so you are duplicating my books and handing them out to all your friends and not paying me a royalty. yeah. and i think that's wrong. my judicial system and my police force think that's wrong. and we're both living in the same geographic area. so we have overlapping jurisdictions. now the anarchists would say, well, we'll negotiate. why should we negotiate? my system is actually right. there is such a thing as intellectual property rights. there's no negotiation here. you're wrong. and you should either pay a fine or go to jail. yeah, but why can't, because it's a community, there's multiple parties and it's a majority vote. they'll hire different forces that says, yeah, your honor, it's onto something here with the definition of property and we'll go with that. so anarchists pro-democracy in the majority rule sense? well, i think so. i think anarchy promotes emergent democracy, right? no, it doesn't. i'll tell you what it promotes. it promotes emergent strife and civil war and violence, constant uninterrupted violence. cause the only way to settle the dispute between us, since we both think that we are right and we have guns behind us to protect that. and we have a legal system. we have a whole theory of ideas is you're stealing my stuff. how do i get it back? i invade you, right? i take over, you know, and who's gonna win? that bad, the smartest guy? oh, the guy with the biggest guns. see, but the anarchists would say that they're using implied, the state uses implied force. they're already doing violence. because they take the state as it is today and they refuse to engage in the conversation about what a state should and could look and how we can create mechanisms to protect us from the state using those new, but look, this is my view of anarchy is very simple. it's a ridiculous position. it's infantile. i mean, i really mean this, right? and i'm sorry to michael, but and all the other very, very smart, very, very smart anarchists. cause anarchists is never, you won't find a dumb anarchist. right. because dumb people know it wouldn't work. you have to have, it's absolutely true. you have to have a certain iq to be an anarchist. that's true. they're all really intelligent. they're all intelligent. and the reason is that you have to create such a mythology in your head. you have to create so many rationalizations. any joe in the street knows it doesn't work because they can understand what happens when two people who are armed are in the street and have a dispute and there's no mechanism to resolve that dispute. yeah. that's objective. that's separate. and this is where it gets the objective. that's objective. the whole point of government is that it is the objective authority for determining the truth in one regard, in regard to force. because the only alternative to determining it when it comes to force is through force. the only way to resolve disputes is through force or through this negotiation, which is unjust because if one party's right and one party's wrong, why negotiate? and this is the point. i'm not against competition of governance. i'm all for competition of governance. we do that all the time. it's called countries. the united states has a certain governance structure. the soviet union had a governance structure. mexico has a governance structure. and they're competing. and we can observe the competition. and in my world, you could move freely from one governance to another. if you didn't your governance, you would move to a better governance system. but they have to have autonomy within a geographic area. otherwise, what you get is complete and utter civil war. the law needs to be objective. and there needs to be one law over a piece of ground. and if you disagree with that law, you can move somewhere else where they may. this is why federalism is such a beautiful system. even within the united states, we have states. and on certain issues, we're allowed to disagree between states, the death penalty. some states do, some states don't. fine. and now i can move from one state if i don't it. but there's certain issues you cannot have disagreement. slavery, for example, this is why we had a civil war. but let me, one other argument against anarchy. markets exist where force has been eliminated. sorry, can you say that again? markets exist where the rule of force has been eliminated. the rule of force? yes. can you elaborate that? so a market will exist if we know that you can't pull a gun on me and just take my stuff. i am willing to engage in transaction with you if we have an implicit understanding that we're not gonna use force against each other. so force has something special to it. yes. it's a special, it overrides, because we're still agreeing we can manipulate each other. yes. but force we can't. force kinda, yes, so there's something fundamental about violence. force is a fundamental force. it's the anti-reason. it's the anti-life. it's the anti-force against another person. and what it does is shuts down the mind. right. so in order to have a market, you have to extract force. that's fascinating. how can you have a market in force? it, when i, there's an instagram channel called nature's metal, where it has all these videos of animals, basically having a market of force. yes. but that shuts down the ability to reason. and animals don't need to because they can't. exactly. so the innovation that is human beings is our capacity to reason, and therefore the relegation of force to the animals. we don't do force. civilization is where we don't have force. and so what you have is you cannot have a market in that, which a market requires the elimination of it. and i, you know, i don't debate formally these guys, but i interact with them all the time, right? and you get these absurd arguments where, you know, david friedman will say, that's milton friedman's son. he will say something , well, in somalia, in the northern part of somalia, where they have no government, you have all these wonderful, you have these tribal tribunals of these tribes, and they resolve disputes. yeah. barbarically, they use sharia law. they have no respect for individual rights, no respect for property. and the only reason they have any authority is because they have guns and they have power and they have force and they do it barbarically. there's nothing civilizing about the courts of somalian. and they write about pirates and because they view force, they don't view force as something unique that must be extracted from human life. and that's why anarchy has to devolve into violence. because it treats forces just, what's the big deal? we're negotiating, you know, over guns. so we covered a lot of high level philosophy, but i'd to touch on the troubles, the chaos of the day. yeah. a couple of things, and i really, trying to find a hopeful path way out. so one is the current coronavirus pandemic. or in particular, not the virus, but our handling of it. is there something philosophically, politically that you would to see, that you would to recommend, that you would to maybe give a hopeful message if we take that kind of trajectory, we might be able to get out? because i'm kind of worried about the economic pain that people are feeling, that there's this quiet suffering. i mean, i agree with you completely. there is a quiet suffering, it's horrible. i mean, i know people, i go to a lot of restaurants. one of the things we love to do is eat out. my wife doesn't cooking anymore. we don't have kids in the house anymore, so she doesn't have to. so we go out a lot, we go to restaurants. and because we have our favorites, we go to them a lot, we get to know the owners of the restaurant, the chef. and it's just heartbreaking. you know, these people put their life, their blood, sweat and tears, i mean, real blood, sweat and tears, into these projects. restaurants are super difficult to manage. most of them go bankrupt anyway. and the restaurants, we go to a good restaurant, so they've done a good job, and they offer unique value. and they shut them down. and many of them will never open. something they estimate 50, 60 of restaurants in some places won't open. these are people's lives, these are people's capital, these are people's effort, these are people's love, talk about love, they love what they do, particularly if they're the chef as well. and it's gone, and it's disappeared. and what are they gonna do with their lives now? they're gonna live off the government the way our politicians would them, bigger and bigger stimulus plans, so we can hand checks to people to get them used to living off of us rather than, it's disgusting and it's offensive and it's unbelievably sad. and this is where it comes to this, i care about other people. i mean, this idea that objectivists don't care. i mean, i love these people who provide me with pleasure of eating wonderful food in a great environment. there's something inspiring about them too. like when i say a great restaurant owner, i wanna do better with my own stuff. yeah, exactly. it's inspiring. anybody who does it is excellent. i love sports because it's the one realm in which you'd still value and celebrate excellence. but i try to celebrate excellence everything in my life. so i try to be nice to these people. and with covid, we went more to restaurants, if you believe it or not. we did more takeout stuff. we made an effort, particularly the restaurants, we really loved it to keep them going, to encourage them, to support them. the problem is philosophy drives the world. the response to covid has been worse than pathetic. and it's driven by philosophy. it's driven by disrespect to science, ignorance and disrespect of statistics, a disrespect of individual human decision-making. government has to decide everything for us. and just throughout the process and a disrespect of markets, because we didn't let markets work to facilitate what we needed in order to deal with this virus. if you look at the place, it's interesting that the only place on the planet that's done well with this are parts of asia. taiwan did phenomenally with this. and the vice president of taiwan is an epidemiologist. so he knew what he was doing. and they got it right from the beginning. south korea did amazing. even hong kong and singapore. hong kong is just very few deaths. and the economy wasn't shut down in any of those places. there were no lockdowns in any of those places. the cdc had plans before this happened on how to deal with good plans. indeed, if you ask people around the world before the pandemic, which country is best prepared for a pandemic, they would have said the united states. because of the cdc's plans and all of our emergency reserves and all that, and the wealth. and yet all of that went out the window. because people panicked, people didn't think, go back to reason, people were arrogant, refused to use the tools, that they had at their disposal to deal with this. so you deal with pandemics. it's very simple how you deal with pandemics. and this is how south korea and taiwan, you deal with them by testing, tracing and isolating. that's it. and you do it well. and you do it vigorously. and you do it on scale if you have to. and you scale up to do it. and we have the wealth to do that. so one question i have, it's a difficult one. so they talk about love a lot. and you've just talked about donald trump. i guarantee you, this particular segment will be full of division from the internet. but i believe that should be and can be fixed. what i'm referring to in particular is the division. because we've talked about the value of reason. and what i've noticed on the internet is the division shuts down reason. so when people hear you say trump, actually the first sentence you said about trump, they'll hear trump and their ears will perk up. and they'll immediately start in that first sentence, they'll say, is he a trump supporter or a trump? they're not interested in anything else after that. and then after that, that's it. and what, how do, so my question is, you as one of the beacons of intellectualism, quite honestly, i mean, it sounds silly to say, but you are a beacon of reason. how do we bring people together long enough to where we can reason? i mean, there's no easy way out of this because the fact that people have become tribal and they have, very tribal. and the tribe, in the tribe reason doesn't matter. it's all about emotion. it's all about belonging or not belonging. and you don't wanna stand out. you don't wanna have a different opinion. you wanna belong and it's all about belonging. it took us decades to get back to tribalism where we were hundreds of years ago. it took millennium to get out of tribalism. it took the enlightenment to get us to the point of individualism where we think for, and reason, respect for reason. before that, we were all tribal. so it took the enlightenment to get us out of it. we've been in the enlightenment for about 250 years influenced by the enlightenment. and it's fading. the impact is fading. so what would we need to get out of it? we need self-esteem. people join a tribe because they don't trust their own mind. people join a tribe because they're afraid to stand on their own two feet. they're afraid to think for themselves. they're afraid to be different. they're afraid to be unique. they're afraid to be an individual. people need self-esteem. to gain self-esteem, they have to have respect for rationality. they have to think and they have to achieve and they have to recognize that achievement. to do that, they have to have respect for thinking. they have to have respect for reason. and we have to think about the schools. we have to have schools that teach people to think, teach people to value their mind. we have schools that teach people to feel and value their feelings. we have groups of six-year-olds sitting around a circle discussing politics. what? they don't know anything. they're ignorant. see, you don't know anything when you're ignorant. yes, you can feel, but your feelings are useless as decision-making tools. but we emphasize emotion. it's all about socialization and emotion. this is why they talk about this generation of snowflakes. they can't hear anything that they're opposed to because they've not learned how to use their mind, how to think. so it boils down to teaching people how to think two things, how to think and how to care about themselves. so it's thinking and self-esteem and they're connected because when you think, you achieve, which gains you self-esteem. when you have self-esteem, it's easier to think for yourself. and i don't know how you do that quickly. i mean, i think leadership matters. so part of what i try to do is try to encourage people to do those things, but i am a small voice. you asked me when early on you said we should talk about why i'm not more famous. i'm not famous. my following is not big. it's very small in the scope of things. well, yours and objectivism and that question, could you linger on it for a moment? why isn't objectivism more famous? i think because it's so challenging. it's not challenging to me, right? when i first encountered objectivism, it's after the first shock and after the first kind of, none of this can be true. this is all bs. and fighting it, once i got it, it was easy. it required years of studying, but it was easy in the sense of, yes, this makes sense. but it's challenging because it upends everything. it really says what my mother taught me is wrong. and what my politicians say left and right is wrong, all of them. there's not a single politician on which i agree with on almost anything, right? because on the fundamentals, we disagree. and what my teachers are telling me is wrong and what jesus said is wrong. and it's hard. but the thing is, so you talk about politics and all that kind of stuff, but most people don't care. the more powerful thing about objectivism is the practical of my life, of how i revolutionize my life. and that feels to be a very important and appealing, get your shit together kind of. yeah, but this is why jordan peterson is so much more successful than we are, right? why is that? make your bed or whatever it is. yeah, because his personal responsibility is shallow. it's make your bed, stand up straight. it's what my mother told me when i was growing up. there's nothing new about jordan peterson. he says, embrace christianity. christianity is fine, right? religion is okay. just do these few things and you'll be fine. and by the way, he says, happiness, you either have it or you don't. it's random. you can't bring about your own happiness. so he's giving people an easy out. people want easy out. people buy self-help books that give them five principles for living a shallow... i'm telling them, think, stand on your own two feet, be independent, don't listen to your mother, do your own thing, but thoughtfully, not based on emotions. so you're responsible not just for a set of particular... habits and so on. you're responsible for everything. yes, and you're responsible. here's the big one, right? you're responsible for shaping your own soul. your consciousness, you get to decide what it's going to be . and the only tool you have is your mind. your only tool is your mind. well, your emotions play a tool when they're properly cultivated. they play a role in that. and the tools you have is thinking, experiencing, living, coming to the right conclusions, listening to great music and watching good movies. and art is very important in shaping your own soul and helping you do this. it's got a crucial role in that. but it's work. and it's lonely work because it's work you do with yourself. now, if you find somebody who you love, who shares these values and you can do with them, that's great. but it's mostly lonely work. it's hard. it's challenging. it ends your world. the reward is unbelievable. but even at the... think about the enlightenment, right? so up until the enlightenment, where was truth? truth came from a book. and there were a few people who understood the book. most of us couldn't read. and they conveyed it to us. and they just told us what to do. and in that sense, life's easy. it sucks. and we die young and we have nothing and we don't enjoy it. but it's easy. and the enlightenment comes around and says, we've got this tool. it's called reason. and it allows us to discover truth about the world. it's not in a book. it's actually your reason allows you to discover stuff about the world. and i consider the first, really the first figure of the enlightenment is newton, not locke, right? it's a scientist. he teaches us the laws of mechanics, how does stuff work? and people go, , wow, this is cool. i can use my mind. i can discover truth. isn't that amazing? and everything opens up once you do that. hey, if i can discover, if i understand the laws of motion, if i can understand truth in the world, how come i can't decide who i marry? i mean, everything was fixed in those days. how come i can't decide what profession i should be in? everybody belonged to a guild. how come i can't decide who my political leader should be? so it's all reason. it's all once you understand the efficacy of your own mind to understand truth, to understand reality, discover truth, not understand truth, discover it, everything opens up. now you can take responsibility for your own life because now you have the tool to do it. but we are living in an era where postmodernism tells us there is no truth, there is no reality, and our mind is useless anyway. critical race theory tells us that you're determined by your race, and your race shapes everything, and your free will is meaningless, and your reason doesn't matter because reason is just shaped by your genes and shaped by the color of your skin. it's the most racist theory of all. and you've got our friend at uc irvine telling them, , your senses don't tell you anything about reality anyway. reality is what it is. so, you know, what's the purpose of reason? it's to invent stuff, it's to make stuff up. and what use is that? it's complete fantasy. you've basically got every philosophical, intellectual voice in the culture telling them their reason is impotent. there's a steven pinker who tries, and i love pinker, and he's really good, and i love his books. but, you know, he needs to be stronger about this. and there's a few people on kind of, there's a few people, partially in the intellectual dark web and otherwise, who are big on reason, but not consistent enough and not full understanding of what it means or what it implies. and then there's little old me. and it's me against the world in a sense, because i'm not only willing to articulate the case for reason, but then what that implies. it implies freedom, it implies capitalism, it implies taking personal responsibility over your own life. and the other intellectual dark web people get to reason, and they're, , politics, you can be whatever. no, you can't. you can't be a socialist and for reason. it doesn't actually, those are incompatible. and you can't be a determinist and for reason. reason and determinism don't go together. the whole point of reason is that it's an achievement, it requires effort, it requires engagement, it requires choice. so it is, it does feel a little old me, because that's it. the allies i have are allies among some libertarians over economics. i have some allies in the intellectual dark web maybe over reason, but none of them are allies in the full sense. my allies are the other objectivists, but they're not a lot of us. for people listening to this, for the few folks kind of listening to this and thinking about the trajectory of their own life, i guess the takeaway is reason is a difficult project, but a project that's worthy of taking on. yeah, and i don't know if difficulty is the right word, because difficult sounds it's, you know, i have to push this boulder up a hill. it's not difficult in that sense. it's difficult in the sense that it requires energy and focus. it requires effort, but it's immediately rewarding. it's fun to do, and its rewards are immediate, pretty quick, right? it takes a while to undo all the garbage that you have, but we all have that i had that took me years and years and years to get rid of certain concepts and certain emotions that i had that didn't make any sense, but it takes a long time to fully integrate that. so i don't want it to sound it's a burden, it's hard in that sense. it does require focus and energy, and i don't want it to sound a dr. spock. i don't want it to sound a dr. spock, and i don't think i do because i'm a pretty passionate guy, but i don't want it to appear , , just forget about emotions. emotions are how you experience the world. you want to have strong emotions. you want to live. you want to experience life strongly and passionately. you just need to know that emotions are not cognition. it's another realm. it's don't mix the realms. think about outcomes and then experience them, and sometimes your emotions won't coincide with what you think should be, and that means there's still more integration to be done. yaron, as i told you offline, i've been a fan of yours for a long time. it's been, i was a little starstruck early on, getting a little more comfortable now. i believe it's gone. i highly recommend that people that haven't heard your work, listen to it through the yaron brooks show. the times i've disagreed with something i've heard you say is usually a first step on a journey of learning a lot more about that thing, about that viewpoint, and that's been so fulfilling. it's been a gift. the passion, you talk about reason a lot, but the passion radiates in a way that's just contagious and awe-inspiring. thank you for everything you've done for this world. it's truly an honor and a pleasure to talk to you. well, thank you. my award is that if i've had an impact on you and people you, wow. i mean, that's amazing. when you wrote to me in email saying you've been a fan, i was blown away because i had no idea and completely unexpected. every few months i discover, hey, i had an impact on this world and people that i would have never thought. the only way to change the world is to change your one mind at a time. when you have an impact on a good mind and a mind that cares about the world and a mind that goes out and does something about it, then you get the exponential growth. through you, i've impacted other people and that's how you ultimately change everything. in spite of everything, i'm optimistic in a sense that i think that the progress we've made today is so universally accepted, the scientific progress, the technological progress. it can just vanish it did when rome collapsed. whether it's in the united states or some way, progress will continue, the human project for human progress will continue. i think these ideas, ideas of reason and individualism will always be at the heart of it. what we are doing is continuing the project of the enlightenment. it's the project that will save the human race and allow it to, for elon musk and for jeff bezos to reach the stars. thank you for masterfully ending on a hopeful note. your honor, a pleasure and an honor. thanks. thank you. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

so the perimeter of the star is really the outsides. if you take the bases away of each of these triangles. so it is this side, let me do this in a new color actually so the perimeter of the triangle i will do in orange. it is going to be this plus that plus that plus that plus that plus that i think you get the idea plus that plus that plus that plus that so the perimeter of the of the star so let me call this perimeter perimeter of the star it is going to be equal to the perimeter of the 5 triangles is equal to perimeter of 5 outer triangles. just call them 5 triangles this minus their basis, right, if i take the perimeter of all of these sides if i added up the part that should not be part of the perimeter of the star would be this part,that part, that part,that part, that part and that part. those are not the part, those are not the part of the perimeter of the star so should be the perimeter of the 5 triangles minus the links of their bases links of their 5 bases. so what is the perimeter of the 5 triangles? well, the perimeter of each of them is 30, perimeter of 5 of them is going to be 5 times 30 which is 150, now we want to subtract out the links of their 5 bases now the links of their 5 bases if we add them up is the exact perimeter of this in inner pentagon right over here. so this inner pentagon has a perimeter 50, that is the sum of the 5 bases. so that right over here is 50, so the perimeter of the star is going to be 150 minus 50, or or 100. all we need is to get the perimeter of all triangles, subtracted out these bases which was the perimeter of the inner pentagon and we are done. now lets do the next problem. what is the area of this this quadrilateral, something that has 4 sides of abcd? and this is a little bit we have not seen a figure quite this just yet, it on the right hand side looks a rectangle, and on the left hand side looks a triangle and this is actually trapezoid, but we can actually as you could imagine the way we figure out the area of several triangles splitting it up into pieces we can recognise. and the most obvious thing to do here is started a and just drop a rock drop an altitude right over here, and so this line right over here is going to hit at 90 degrees and we could call this point e. and what is interesting here is we can split this up into something we recognize a rectangle and a right triangle. but you might say how do, how do we figure out what these you know we have this side and that side, so we can figure out the area of this rectangle pretty straight forwardly. but how would we, how would we figure out the area of this triangle? well if this side is 6 then that means that this that ec is also going to be 6. if ab is 6, notice we have a rectangle right over her, opposite side of a rectangle are equal. so if ab equals 6, implies that ec is equal to 6, ec is equal to 6, so ec is equal to 6 and if ec is equal to 6 then that tells us that de is going to be 3. de is going to be 3, this distance right over here is going to be 3. and we know that because if this is 6, this has to be something that we add to 6 to get 9, 9 was the length of this entire, of the entire base of this figure right over here. 9 was this entire distance so 9 minus 6 gives us 3, and now we have all the information that we need to figure out the area. the area of this part right over here of this rectangle is just going to be 6 times 7, so is going to be equal to 42 plus the area of this triangle right over here. plus the area of this triangle right over here, and that is one half base times height one half. the base over her is 3, one half times 3 and the height over here is once again going to be 7 this is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so if this is 7, this is also going to be 7 one half times 3 times 7, so it is going be 42, lets see. 3 times 7 is 21, 21 divided by 2 is 10.5, 10.5 so this is going to be equal to 52.5 52.5 is the area of this entire figure. lets do one more. so here i have a bizarre looking, a bizarre looking shape, and we need to figure out its perimeter. and it it first seems very daunting because they have only given us this side and this side and they have only given us this side right over here. and one thing that we are allowed to assume in this and you don't always have to make you can't always make that assumption and i just didn't draw it here i had time because it would had really crowded out this this diagram. is it all of the angles in this diagrams are right angles,so i could have drawn a right angle here a right angle here, a right angle there, right angle there, but as you can see it kind of makes things a little bit, it makes things a little bit messy. but how do we figure out the perimeter if we don't know these little distances, if we don't know these little distances here. and the secret here is to kind of shift the sides because all we want to care about is the sum of the sides of the sides. so what i will do is a little exercise in shifting the sides. so this side over here i am going to shift it and put it right up there, then this side right over here, this length right over here i am going to shift and put it right over there. then let me keep using different colors, and then this side right over here i am going to shift it and put it right up here. then finally iam going to have this side right over here, i can shift it and put it right over there and i think you see what is going on right now. now all of these sides combined are going to be the same as this side kind of building, even you know this thing was not a rectangle,its its perimeter is going to be a little bit interesting. all we have to think about is this 2 right over here, now lets think about all of these sides that is going up and down. so this side i can shift it all the way to the right and go right over here. let me make it clear all inside goes all the way to the end, right that it is the exact same all insde. now this white side i can shift all the way to the right over there, then this green side i can shift right over there and then i have, and then i can shift, and then i can shift this. actually let me not shift that green side yet, let me just leave that green side so i have not, i have not done anything yet, let me be clear i have not done anything yet with that and that i have not shift them over and let me take this side right over here and shift it over. so let me take this entire thing and shift over there and shift it over there. so before i count these two pieces right over here and we know that each have length 2 this 90 degrees angle, so this has link to and this has link to. before i count these two pieces, i shifted everything else so i was able to form a rectangle. so at least counting everything else i have 7 plus 6, so lets see 7 plus 6 all of these combined are also going to be 7, plus 7, and all of these characters combined are all also going to be 6, plus 6, and then finally i have this 2, right here that i have not counted before, this 2, plus this 2, plus this 2. and then we have our perimeter, so what is this giving us, 7 plus 6 is 13, plus 7 is 20, plus 6 is 26, plus 4 more is equal to 30. and we are done.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

therapist absolutely! each patient is unique, and their specific condition, medical history, and functional limitations require a tailored approach to rehabilitation. by developing an individualized treatment plan, we can ensure that the patient receives the most effective and efficient care possible. interviewer that makes sense. what are some examples of exercises and massage techniques that can be used in rehabilitation? therapist there are many different exercises and massage techniques that can be used depending on the patient's specific condition. for example, for osteoarthritis, we might focus on low-impact exercises to improve joint mobility and strengthen the muscles around the affected joint. for fibromyalgia, we might use massage techniques to help relieve pain and stiffness. it's important to work with a qualified healthcare professional to determine the best approach for each patient's unique needs. 8. pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller once upon a time, there was a little girl named lily who had a knee injury. she couldn't run or jump she used to, and it made her sad. but then she met a kind therapist named sarah who helped her get better. sarah showed lily some special exercises and massage techniques to help her knee feel better. they started with some simple stretches to help loosen up lily's knee, and then they moved on to some strengthening exercises to help build up the muscles around her knee. sarah also used some gentle massage techniques to help relieve any pain or stiffness that lily was feeling. with sarah's help, lily was able to get back to running and jumping again! the end.\", 'completion': 'written'}\n",

      "{'prompt': 'the song, originally written and performed by the meat puppets, describes a plateau, which i imagine as a red outcrop surrounded by hills and a desert, which has nothing on the top but a bucket and a mop and an illustrated book about birds. i sometimes imagine walking around this plateau, having climbed it already, and watching the purple clouds hovering just above the horizon, leaving visible a band of sky colored in the tones of a recently set sun. i imagine sitting down on a flat rock and picking up the illustrated bird book, and staring at the front cover. illustrated on the front cover in colored pencil is a crane, and, possibly, a barn owl, but maybe because the light is low i cannot well make out what is on the cover. at first i think i see birds, but then perhaps i see a window or a doorknob. when i open the book, i imagine, i have opened it to a list of names, all in alphabetical order. i read through the list, occasionally coming upon the name of someone i know, but always wondering whether it is simply a coincidence and that the name refers to a stranger. i open the book to another page at random and see minutely detailed plant sketches, along with their botanical names. i imagine that if i sit here long enough ill come upon everything which has ever existed, and possibly everything that at some point in time will exist. far below me the shadows the shrubs leave on the desert sand are faint, shadows of shadows. even as i think longer about the lyrics of plateau, i cant tell if the meat puppets intended to describe a place that signifies nothing but itself, or if the plateau is simply an allegory; and i feel as if the plateau is something i had dreamed and as if i were sitting upright in bed and puzzling over whether it symbolized something from my unconscious mind maybe the last days events or whether it was simply an irreducible image. on the lyric website genius are suggestions which favor the allegorical interpretation, but because i am somewhat invested in seeing the plateau as simply a beautiful image, i havent spent much time searching for the opinions of others. i simply let myself be mesmerized by the solitary objects which are lying there on stone hundreds of feet in the air. i have a deep conviction that the illustrated book lying on top of the plateau is not only about birds but about many things. maybe it is an atlas of the modern world, containing maps of our cities, but also of our virtual connections with each other, sketching out in color the abstract paths which lead to and from our phones. once, looking up from the book on birds, i imagined that the plateau was towering far into the sky, so that i could see the cities and people of the earth; and that the roofs were stripped from the buildings and cars so that i could see the heads of all the people on the planet; and that the people looking down at their hands or into a screen far outnumbered those people which were physically on their way somewhere; and though there was a contrast between these two kinds of people, it wasnt true that those looking at their phones or computers didnt feel as if they were on their way somewhere, perhaps wandering through a field of images or otherwise walking resolutely through a path towards a determined end. i cant vouch for the truth of this vision, put into further doubt by the fact that billions of people arent regularly, if at all, connected to the internet. but perhaps in the future, at any given time of the day, internet users will far outnumber people moving to a new location in space. so would predict a narrow vision of societal progress, i thought to myself as i sat at my desk and browsed through different statistics on phone usage. i was reminded then of a mexican politician a friend told me about whose election platform, running to be president of mexico if im not mistaken, in large part consisted of bringing tablets and wi-fi to rural areas of mexico. the vision of a thoroughly technological future, i thought as i sat there at my desk, seems inevitable only if our eyes rest on the charts and tables almost always in our field of vision, or else just outside, waiting on the periphery which detail the rising use of technology throughout the last few decades, the expanding scope of wireless data coverage, the rising appetite of developing countries for consumer electronics, and so forth. the charts and tables are often elegant and practical, sometimes even beautiful in their simplicity, religious symbols. like images they proliferate and insinuate themselves into our private thoughts, somehow diverting our gaze, i thought while sitting at my desk, from the endless and deafening flow of raw materials which at this very moment was coursing through the machinery of our world, burning and being transformed into pure light; i imagined the people of the world as a small tribe of cave-dwelling creatures, chained to the ground, watching the shadows cast on the wall as puppets played overhead in front a gasoline fire; i wondered if life would ever be anything more than a series of unsubstantial and incomprehensible images. what would happen, i asked myself, once this material flow was interrupted? like cans of food stocked at a grocery store, these images of progress would be placed on the shelf, next to all the other ideas that weve silently abandoned yet never managed to get rid of. the past is continuously insinuating itself into the present, forcefully, as if it wants to overtake us and erase us, even as our flesh and our buildings slowly disintegrate into the past. this has always been true, i thought while sitting at my desk, but it will be especially true this time around, as the material basis of our progress evaporates into smoke. time and again, in mesopotamia or the yucatan, we have turned our earth into salt and our forests into waste; and now we turn the amazon into grazing land for cattle. at that moment i was listening to a boards of canada album. the cover of the album, which is completely in shades of red and yellow, depicts human figures, alternating with trees, standing spread-eagle on a hexagon shape. this image gives me the impression of a world totally devoid of depth, a world whose most profound basis is two-dimensional and delirious from continuous exposure to the sun. for me, the sonic equivalent of this impression is the sound of a shallow speaker playing into a wooden box; i imagine listening to this album to attain some deeper truth but hearing nothing but the flat and tinny sounds of music being played in a box, the box itself lying in the heat somewhere in the sparse california woods; the disappointment of which develops into a sort of quiet terror that life does not go past the material realm. but in fact, the album is full of lushness and sonic profundity. partly responsible for the fullness of the sound is the nostalgia it evokes, sometimes even for things you have never experienced firsthand. the music mimics the warbling sounds of older nature documentaries, even simulating the warping pitch of an old videotape. a new contraption to capture the dandelion in one piece has been put together by the crew, i heard at that very moment, sitting at my desk and listening to the music. i hardly have memories of watching nature documentaries as a child, yet listening to this music brings me back to watching tv on a chilly day on my childhood couch, which from a distance appears gray but up close is made up of white, shiny pink, yellow and green fibers, almost a rainbow shimmering in its weave. the boards of canada made this music in a musical scene that had nearly unlimited amounts of enthusiasm for the futuristic; their contemporaries were creating music with unheard-of rhythms and timbres; yet the music of this album is thoroughly nostalgic and, when not sounding sinister, warm. in another one of its songs we hear the lyrics the past inside the present, bluntly summing up the sound of the album. everything we make, even when we are consciously trying to push into something new, is only different from the past by degrees; the vast majority of everything we create is an echo of the past; and even the small inroads we make into the future are not enough to stop the massive and opposite movements, the tide receding after the moon disappears, into a previous state of affairs, forever mixing contemporary peculiarities with the eternally recurring themes of history. a while ago i came upon a list on wikipedia of all the different genres of songs composed by the 11th-century troubadours, and the lyrical tradition flourishing in their wake, ending around the time of the black plague. these genres include songs renouncing love; songs apologizing to a lover; songs about escaping from a rendezvous under the nose of a jealous partner; boasting songs which include challenges; songs of a lovers apology; love songs addressed to someone not ones lover; songs of lovers waiting impatiently for the evening to come, to consummate their love; songs complaining about a ladys behavior; songs expressing indignation and feelings of insult; in short, topics which make up most of popular music today. asking whether the troubadours and their heirs were elaborating on ancient human sentiments or developing a new way of understanding love, arising from their situation as court entertainers, which we now mistakenly take to be timeless seems to be beside the point. i remembered, sitting there at my desk, that in its first few sentences the zhuangzi, now around two and a half thousand years old, quotes from a made-up book to make fun of people that quote from books a reminder that jokes about books are as old as books; that mocking entails making use of not only the content but the form of that which is being mocked; that the post-moderns did not invent self-reflexive jokes about books, nor borges, nor carlyle, nor sir thomas browne; and in general we see that under the sun the race is not to the swift, neither bread to the wise, but time and chance happens to them all. as i listened to the lyrics about trapping a daisy i looked out my window at a few red poppies rustling in a gentle breeze. these poppies dont do well here in boston, i thought sitting at my desk the seeds tend to die in winter. but my neighbor keeps up her garden, diligently collecting the poppy seeds in the fall and planting them in the spring. red poppies, papaver rhoeas, a mixture of latin and greek which means red food, are also known as common poppies, and are distinct from opium poppies, papaver somniferum, which must mean sleep food, i thought sitting at my desk, and which would have questionable legal status if it were growing in my neighbors yard. de quincey once wrote happiness might now be bought for a penny, and carried in the waistcoat pocket; he was talking about laudanum, a tincture containing opium poppy powder that, i read on wikipedia, contains both morphine and codeine and other opium alkaloids; this thought of his anticipated a trend, seen in many people my age, to understand drugs mdma, ketamine, adderall, and even psychedelics lsd and psilocybin, as moods and mental states they can keep in their pocket and freely take to enhance their daily experience. the purest states of fear i have experienced occurred in delirious dreams caused by cough medicine containing codeine. in one dream i was in the pit of a coliseum, full of people, and i knew that a beam of light was about to shine on me and annihilate me forever; i felt the absolute heaviness of my impending annihilation weigh on my being. in another dream i was a block in a wall of multi-colored blocks, and, in some sort of competition, the blocks were being eliminated in groups, in a manner not unlike tetris or candy crush; i knew i was on the edge of being eliminated forever. in another dream i was, inexplicably, terrified that my sister had become a nascar driver. in each of these dreams, the sense of fear was unadulterated by any of the sensations with which fear presents itself in daily life there was no adrenal thrill, and there was no hope of escape; in an inversion of quotidian fear, the fear became the primary fact and the situation was merely decoration; and the sense of fear had a palpable physical weight, and that weight was nearly infinite. all this from a powdered flower. there is a gorgeously designed book named plant families, i remembered sitting at my desk, with color illustrations resembling classic botany drawings. in combination with its tan pages, the soft and artful illustrations of flowers, foliage, and dissected plant parts evoke antique manuscripts by celebrated naturalists preserved in british museums. its illustrations for the poppy family include the long-headed poppy, papaver dubium, which does not look unlike the red poppies outside my window swaying in the breeze, i thought to myself. like many other recent botany books, plant families is peppered with ominous warnings that the classifications of plants it describes are incomplete; that while normally so-and-so plant is included in this family, in this book it will be included in such-and-such family; that the classification for many flowers is currently undergoing several contentious revisions; that ferns will altogether be excluded because their classification is at this very moment up in the air, so to speak. and in fact, we are living in a time of at least two distinct plant classifications. one of them, under development for hundreds of years and by now thoroughly standard, used, i have read, by such references as the jepsen manual, is based on close observation of a plants shape and biology; the other, newer classification is based on methods, still young, of reading the vast sequences of nucleotides which make up specific plant genes. the newer classification, which might instead be called a constellation of separate, clashing, and developing classifications, is a vast, contentious, and interpretive undertaking, nearly hermetic in its obscurity. what made the newer classifications possible, i mused at my desk, was the existence of an objective historical record dna; and so after centuries of plant knowledge had congealed under the western sky, history reasserted herself over her domain, which was quiet and green; and that the new priests were at this moment claiming authority to speak aloud the notes she had scattered widely. the interpreting of plant dna has already rearranged the flowers, which make up most of all plant life; but still, the older classification must be learned to identify flowers in the field the old methods of identification has become so systematized that, although it is vast, one may pick up a field guide and with little training identify the family and even species of a plant they come across while out walking no need to lug around a dna sequencer', 'completion': 'written'}\n",

councilwoman price, vice mayor andrew's council member. the recommendation to receive and file a report requested by councilman price from csu l.b. anthropology department on the topic of long beach homelessness and outreach efforts. thank you, councilman price. thank you. for the record, this is not the debate portion yet. i am presenting the agenda item. so i'm so glad to be receiving this report today. so if we can have our long beach state students come down, i'd really appreciate it. it was over two years ago now that we began discussing this research and the important role it could play for addressing homelessness in long beach. i want to thank our homeless outreach team and the health department, as well as our quality of life officers in the police department and our heart units in the fire department for working so closely with these students to ensure their research and information was strong. focusing on the incredibly difficult question of why some people experiencing homelessness refuse services could have a huge impact on the way we conduct outreach. it takes 17 interactions on average to convince and build the credibility with an individual to accept services. and those 17 interactions are over months and sometimes years and mean city staff has to spend time and work to conduct this outreach and to build that credibility, focusing on how we can reduce that number and tailor outreach to get people to accept the fantastic services we provide here in long beach not only helps individuals, but improves our community and could save us money for classes from cal state. long beach's anthropology department worked on this project for over two years. over 550 hours of outreach and field work went into this report. they had 487 documented outreach encounters. information on the use of global tickets and their potential benefits to getting people into services was very interesting. they did interviews with service providers that we partner with as a city and provided details on various hurdles to getting into services that can be studied as a city as we look at making our services and our outreach more efficient. so i'm going to welcome our team from csu. i'll be to the podium. i want to thank you for your patience tonight. the students got to see how democracy works and to be a part of that process. thank you. honorary mayor and member of councils. audience good evening. my name is mitra baghdadi. i'm from department of anthropology at california state university, long beach. and with me, i have a department chair, dr. karen quintilian. two of our students, acacia, adel, anton, know one and two of our undergraduate undergraduate students, phenix, pedro and iris salazar. homelessness got my attention. and when the movement of not in my backyard started popping up on our news feed and i noticed substantial number of close consultation and meeting by city officials and police officers were being held in the different communities across this city and neighborhood, and it was a part of process of how to do that , increasing part of process to deal with, you know, increasing number of homeless individuals in the streets. since i live in district three, i also work in district three in case state longreach and i have witnessed how constable missy price product proactively was working to address homelessness issues around the city. therefore, i approached her with an idea of creating a project that is mutually beneficial partnership between city of long beach and department of anthropology in california state university. long beach. addressing a critical issue homelessness, which is very important for our city and community. councilwoman suzy price as she mentioned, invited and introduced dr. quintilian and i at. and our idea of this collaboration to meet with. and ms.. ms.. theresa chandler, city manager. bureau of helping of health services. and also with ms.. shannon parker, homeless officer, service officer in march of 2017. i want to acknowledge that both of them are here. thank you very much. for two years of collaboration. they they've worked with our students very and the entire two years. and our students were very fortunate to basically get many guidance from their. we listen to some of their challenges and we discuss a plan to conduct conduct. ethnography research. councilwoman suzy pryce wanted to make sure the project is a city recognized project and is specifically wanted to make sure that our students get the recognition for working on this project with the city and experience that needed to get our project. and our research is focused on understanding why many individuals who are experiencing homelessness don't regularly take up services offered to them by the city or government service providers. we tried to understand this question from multiple perspectives. we tried individuals, including individuals who are currently receiving services with individuals who are refused services. and more importantly, we talked with the authority members who attempt to address each client unique circumstances. in past two years. dr. karen quintilian and i, in anthropology department with 12 graduate student and 14 undergraduate students, worked on a collaborative research project with the department of health and human services based and many of the continuum of care partners including. quality of life officers in the police department and health and and fire department, homeless education response team, heart team and many other service providers, including faith based organizations that they play a really important role of giving service to the homeless population in longreach and. six of us here. yeah, six out of six of us here, we are presenting our research, the booklet you have in your hand. we divided our talk into different things. we promise we won't take time. that's much. i know. you have a long night. i would to invite dr. quintilian to share some of our funding findings with you. good evening and thank you, mayor garcia and council members. and it's really hard to follow a debate about how long a presentation should be. so i can assure you we did make sure we were, in a word limit. just so you know. and with that in mind, i do want to really express, you know, sincere appreciation for making this possible to present these research findings on homeless outreach in our city. you know, with four of the key students that prepared this report, there were several other students involved that conducted the research that was described by council member susie price in the number of hours that went into it. and i want to just point out some of those key findings and then invite them up to do a brief description of their research posters and some other key findings that they worked on as part of this report. i'd to emphasize that this report is really meant for you to read as a whole, to really understand the inner workings of the street team. we examined the professional qualities and skills of this team in creating the conditions for service acceptance, both short and long term, and the hurdles they helped people overcome in that process. so i'm just going to outline for you to just, you know, cue up when you read the report, some of these key findings today. first, service acceptance is a continual process. almost all of the 487 outreach encounters, documented and observed, led to the outreach team goals being achieved in one way or another. building trust and rapport, for example. assessing needs immediate and longer term. determining eligibility. acting as a liaison to service and guiding people through the hurdles to care. second, multiple contacts between outreach team members and those experiencing homelessness is critical to under overcoming the lack of trust in, quote, the system that people may possess and believing that personal change is possible. faced with hurdles, some people simply give up. clients describe specifically accepting service as a matter of being ready, being able to meet service criteria. finding a program that fits their needs. and having the support of people such as the outreach team to meet their goals. third, as the frontline workers, the outreach team are responsible for addressing the hotline, calls and emails from the long beach community members. they use professional skills to negotiate and manage the needs of both the larger long beach community and people experiencing homelessness. they conduct outreach in a manner that fosters communication and trust. in that regard for the outreach team innovates to facilitate people experiencing homelessness to take the first step to accessing services. and lastly, further research is needed to identify how the factors that contribute to successful service acceptance can be adapted and how the hurdles to access to services or gaps in services can be addressed. the outreach team has critical knowledge and expertize in understanding both of these areas that can inform practices. and now i'd to invite up the students just to share very, very briefly some of the highlights of their research posters. and thank you very much. hello. my name is ira salazar. i'm an undergraduate student and i'm part of the anthropology department at colby. i'm also part of the building infrastructure leading to diversity program, which is a mentor based research program. which has given me the. opportunity to be part of the homelessness, homelessness, ethnographic research and education lab. my part in the homeless outreach research was assisting in the data analysis and also writing the report that you are being provided today. my poster titled let them get to that place understanding the role of outreach staff connecting homeless individuals to services focuses on the quality of the outreach members need to possess in order to effectively. perform their jobs. and i encourage you to read pages four and five to learn on the report to learn more about the qualities outreach members need to have in themselves in order to effectively connect individuals to services. thank you. hello. my name is phenix. pedro and i will be graduating next week with my bachelor's degree in anthropology at cal state long beach. and then in the fall, i'll be attending a ph.d. program at notre dame university. my project in the here lab revolved around analyzing field notes in interviews to identify the types of obstacles or hurdles that individuals experiencing homelessness face while attempting to obtain services. many of these obstacles are things acquiring the proper documentation and identification in order to gain access to services. there are strict rules and regulations around services, insufficient amount of services, lack of transportation and lack of trust. these are the types of hurdles or obstacles that the outreach team assists people in overcoming when possible and when they are ready. and this can be seen in the barriers portion of the report on pages 16 and 17 in the report. and this research poster here, which is titled barriers to accessing homeless services in long beach, california, which is one of three that have been presented at multiple research conferences over the last year. hello. my name is tyne and i'm a graduate student in the applied anthropology program at cal state long beach. for my research, i honed in on looking at quality of life police officers to work with the outreach team. and what i learned was that they handle most, if not all, of the division service calls that involve people experiencing homelessness. it alleviate some of the pressure off of patrol units and helps the police department provide the most public, good possible quality of life. and the street team work together in coordinated outreach. the officers ensure the safety of the team and provides access to locations the team may not visit. normally, enforcement is conducted very rarely and strategically. in my personal field work sample of 109 outreach interactions, only 15 included some form of enforcement, a citation or arrest. instead, the quality of life officers focused on building rapport, learning what their needs, the needs of the people they're meeting are, and figuring out how they can help the people they meet. there's a lot more detail on page nine that i invite you to look at. thank you. hello. my name is acacia and alan. i'm a graduate student in the department of anthropology. my contribution to this project was examining the transitional period between living on the streets and becoming housed and highlighting the lack of transitional assistance or retention services for individuals experiencing homelessness. it was while conducting this research that i became interested in homeless material culture. the items that individuals collect, keep and dispose of, and how they how they use these items to manifest their idea of home on the spaces that they occupy. taking this as my thesis project, which is my poster right here. thank you. thank you. okay, you guys, that was amazing. amazing. first of all, i want to say this booklet that you've created is so dense with information. it covers so many different topics that we have studied here as a counsel in our study sessions on homelessness. it talks about housing. it talks about the importance of outreach. it talks about obstacles to getting into services the lack of identification alone, just not having an id. what that does for individuals who want a service. this document right here is just unbelievable. i mean, i'm going through it here. you talk about some of the legal hurdles we've had, some of the changes in the law and how that's impacted our homeless population. i really think you should apply for some sort of an award for this research project because this summarizes a lot of what we see every day, and it's just it's just chock full of information. so thank you. this exceeds any expectation i ever had when we first partnered. i mean, it goes above and beyond. and i just have to tell you guys, i wish i wish there were more people here to hear this presentation because this is unlike anything we've seen from it, especially from a college, you know, department with student labor. so thank you. and i want to thank our homeless outreach team. i've had the opportunity and feel incredibly blessed for the continuing opportunity to be able to join the street team on some outreach efforts. and the work that the street teams do is just unbelievable. anytime anyone reaches out to me about a not my backyard type issue, i say, would you to go on a homeless ride along? because i think once they do, it really changes their perspective about what it takes to get someone into a service. so i just i'm so impressed by this, you guys. thank you so much. you have no idea how valuable this is going to be for us in terms of policymaking and making informed decisions based on data. so thank you. thank you. vice mayor interest. yes. thank you very much. first of all, i want to thank councilwoman the price for bringing this forward to our diocese, because what i'm seeing and you guys, first of all, i just want to tell you what a tremendous job you guys have done, because sometimes when i go out and speak to individuals, especially when dealing with homelessness and they're not homeless, and i speak in my various, you know, community groups, you talk about those people where you have put yourself in a position there to be a part of that. i have to give you kudos because the fact that i just can't even imagine what you went through to try to go to get the information that you have. each and every one of you individuals, the job that you've done, it shows people that just not in the third district. homeless is a worldwide problem. we have you. and i just want to thank mrs. price for bringing this forward. and i just wish we had more people here in the council to be able to see this, because you guys don't realize what a great job you're doing and the picture that you're showing to the community, to the city of long beach. fantastic. and go beach. i just have to say that. thank you. thank you. councilman ringo. thank you, mary. and i, too, want to extend my my, um, thank you to councilmember price for including me in this item. i had a a meeting a couple of weeks ago with the lottery, with wetlands authority, and there they have, as you know, a very serious homeless problem that goes into the wetlands and in those areas . you missed that meeting. but but i was there and we had a presentation done by the quality of life officers from that long beach pd there. and what they basically brought forward was the fact that it it it can become a law enforcement issue, but it's a quality of life issue. and for many of those homeless individuals that were there, their compassion and their ability to communicate with the homeless people that were there was just absolutely phenomenal. they were able to have that those 15 or 17 point of contact, but more ten or even less because they were they showed such an amount of of humanity to these individuals that it helped them reconnect with family, reconnect with society, get themselves cleaned up and get back into into the mainstream. and a lot of a lot of what we deal with with homelessness is not you know, we look at it as a law enforcement issue or maybe in an economic issue or socio economic issue, but it's a human issue. and if we are able to treat our fellow human beings more with more with greater sense of humanity, i think we would go a long way in addressing the homeless issues that we have in the city. but i was looking for the chief a little while ago because i want to get those names of those officers that that work in that area. because they made a presentation that was just heartbreaking. i mean, it was it was it showed so much. those guys really need a badge, not a badge. merit medal for for all the work that they do out there, because they were doing phenomenal work in reaching out to these homeless people and getting them back into the into the mainstream to make them back into society. so this report here is absolutely wonderful. it basically documents what a lot of us already know. but you did the research and you did. you collected the data that just basically proves what we may already know or or perceive. and it's in it's all right here. so i agree with councilmember price that this could be a good policy document for us to look at and to determine what directions we want to take and where do we want to spend our money. and obviously, one thing that i can glean from this right now and how you worked already with with these other officers, is that we need to basically put a moral commitment into quality of life issues and quality of life efforts that would do a more direct outreach into the homeless community so that so we could bring in bring them back in, into society and connect them with their families and with the mainstream. so i want to thank all the work you've done. thank you very much. thank you, councilwoman mango. excellent work. we have had the quality of life officers and the outreach team to many of our community meetings. but one of the things that i think is poignant is when a encampment is in a particular community, that's when the community adjacent is most open to understanding and listening and hearing the difference between perceptions realities. we have a lot of crossover jurisdictional issues between long beach city, caltrans, l.a. county, who's in charge? when l.a. county, when long beach goes through to offer services. oftentimes, they won't take the services till the day before the cleanup. how do we work on that efficiency? is there an opportunity for us to work with, say, l.a. county so that they're noticing requirements match the adjacent city? because one of the things that we consistently have as a challenge is as the city resource team goes around and meets with different individuals and cleans up those areas. they move to areas that have longer notice periods and then the neighbors who live adjacent to those area areas have different levels of frustration. and with that frustration comes a reduction in tolerance and compassion. and so we need to kind of be able to figure out and balance the ways in which we can interact and solve this as a whole. so i really appreciate this. i would love a digital copy so that i can do a better job sharing this with my network and our community leaders. i think that this is a great document as a starting point, but it also love to meet with any of you or all of you about your policy recommendations on how we could better pull together. because i know in my district and actually in almost all of our districts, we have so many cross jurisdictional issues where it's, councilwoman, why can't you do something? and the area they're asking about is not within our jurisdiction. and then the frustration of where the funding comes from and how it can be used and what it can and can't be used for. excellent work and we have a lot more work to do. so thank you. thank you, councilmember. super now. thanks. i'd also to thank councilmember price for bringing this item forward. i agree. just an awesome publication. great job. i would say at the highest levels of professionalism, it's hard to believe this was done by students. i did see on page four that it's titled the street sharks. that has nothing to do with the new mascot for coastal languages. you know, i thought about that and i think we're all aligning here. so we're all we're all about the beach now. okay. well, president connelly is going to be at my next community meeting at the end of the month. i'll make sure i point that out to her and to teresa and shannon, thank you for being here tonight. and we all know on the dais here how important they are. in fact, let me just say this. i never thought of your outreach team as sharks, but let's let's explore that a little bit. but the rapport with the council office is so key and because we communicate all the time. and so i just want to acknowledge that and thank you for assisting the group. and finally, councilman gonzalez. i just want to say thank you so much for your work. i see the methodologies that people really need to understand when we're out there reaching, you know, the most vulnerable of our populations. so thank you very much for this work. and also to shannon and teresa. i know you're amplifying a lot of their work. and oftentimes as a councilmember, when i'm explaining this to downtown residents, it doesn't come off very well. they're just thinking that i'm just, you know, not explaining it or they don't understand it or they don't believe me any of the above. but i think this will be a really good way to present it. and i would love to invite you to some of our meetings in downtown to just talk about this report. it would be really great to do that. thank you very much. thank you. is there any other public comment outside the presentation? please come forward. can i get. out? let me go ahead, please. let's do that. actually, no, i mean, i meant one of the professor. please come forward. and ma'am, please come forward also. i just want to emphasize then this. i we as a group and a department, we want to we really appreciate what it was offer to the collaboration, the partnership. it didn't cost that much, but what we gained was priceless. the experience of having our students in a real field, what we did in our class, we designed a class two way that our students, they study all of the, you know, logistic, all the city decisions, everything was happening in the city. and we went and we look at the news nationally and internationally. we let the students sit and do all the forms, one by one, to figure out what the homeless individual has to go to do good services. and then as a result of that, many of our students, our students, they presented their work in three national conference . one no national one of a student got the first prize in the post there they had in the very prestigious conference in anthropology. well, we just want to thank all of you and say this kind of research. basically, we are educating our students to be the agent of change in a community, and that's what we to do. i know as educated as you are, looking forward to it to. absolutely. please come forward. hello, counsel. my name is nita chopra. i am the community development coordinator of mental health america of los angeles. and we are based out of long beach here in the community. we have many. programs targeting, you know, people of the homeless population today, which is our transitional age. youth and even veterans actually came here specifically today to hear about the issue. i'll be anthropology department report. we have a two innovations, two grant funded projects through the department of mental health that were approved this year. one is targeting transitional age youth within the long beach community who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. i came out here today to make you aware of this program that we have and to gain community partners going forward. because as the anthropology department stated, it is all about connections within the community to make sure that we know of the resources that we have available to us to provide towards our. members that we have. so i think it. i just wanted to let you know that we have our next collaborators meeting coming up next week on the 22nd at one of our community partners, the lgbt center of long beach. again, this is for transitional age youth who are 18 to 25, who are homeless or at risk of being homeless, who have experienced some form of trauma from being homeless, experienced poverty, being a lgbtq community. and we. also have another one that is. our workforce development innovations grant, and that is for anyone 18 and over, and that is another sector that we are doing. and it is to provide. stabilization for people's lives going forward, not just in our services, but past our services as well. at mental health america, our goal is to give people a life. we don't want to just give them a service and see them out the door. we want to give them stability and we want to give them a reason to move forward. so i invite you all, encourage you all, please to come to our collaborators meeting next week on the 22nd. and again, that is 12 to 2 p.m. at the lgbt center of long beach. thank you. thank you, councilman brice. thank you. i just have to end it. i want to thank mental health america and fact check. cunningham from my team is going to reach out to you right now because we know that you guys also expressed an interest in our homeless work program that we're trying to roll out. so thank you for that. thank you for all the partners to our cal state long beach team. thank you again for everything. you know what i love about this document here is a lot of time and i want to thank my colleagues. they started their comments with with a lot of thank you's, which is kind of customary. but what we do here but i just want to say there's no thanks to me. there was an opportunity for me to collaborate. and i love that this document here that you created is not political. it doesn't have a, you know, politicians logo on it. it's about you and your work product. and it's a document for us as policymakers to use. it's not any one person's initiative. it's not any one person's effort. this is something that's going to help the entire city. it's for all of us. so i brought the item tonight, but it could have been any of us. you did the work. so i want to thank you for giving us some tools. we're really lucky to have cal state long beach in the city. i'm really lucky to have the university in my district and opportunities to partner on this cost us nothing. we didn't have to give money from the taxpayer dollars to commission the study. we didn't have you didn't have to have 100 people in here asking for money. you did this on your own because it's a research project that's going to enhance your students and it's going to enhance the city that the university is located in. and i wish we could have more endeavors and projects this. so this is so positive. i'm very, very excited about it and i'm so grateful to our city staff for working with you and really driving this project. i just put it on the agenda. i didn't do any of the work. you did everything. so thank you. i think it councilwoman. and i just wanted to close say, first of all, you guys did a great job. amazing that this has been both graduate and undergraduate work in partnership. i think obviously you're doing this graduate level research and just really great. there's there's so many partnerships that the university has with the city, similar projects this with other departments, whether it's engineering or the innovation work happening or with business. and so many projects where students are getting hands on experience and doing work that benefits one the city. but most importantly and i think your faculty got it exactly right, the the folks that are benefiting the most are the students that actually get to do the research that is applied. and it goes back into that classroom and that field experience that you're all getting. and so that's really exciting. and so congratulations. and with that, everyone, please cast your votes. we hope. thank you again. motion carries.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",
      "{'prompt': 'like others who have spoken before me, allow me to add my warm congratulations to mr. al-nasser on his election as president of the general assembly for our current session. my delegation and i assure him, as always, of our support and cooperation. i also wish to thank mr. joseph diess of switzerland for a successful term as president at the sixty-fifth session. we also remember another former president of the assembly, mr. harri holkeri of finland, who passed away earlier this year but who left a lasting impact on the good work of the general assembly and the united nations. as for the ongoing leadership of the organization, i wish to extend my congratulations to secretary-general ban ki-moon on his appointment to a deserved second term. he and the secretariat continue to show the firm resolve needed during these challenging times of global crisis. we pay tribute also to the memory of those members of the secretariat who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of international duty. a further example of the critical role played by the secretary-general during these difficult times was the convening earlier this week of the high-level meeting on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases (ncds). the dangerous potential of ncds, unchecked in small states mine, threatens not just livelihoods and lifestyle but whatever gains may have been achieved as they relate to millennium development goal (mdg) 6 and the other mdgs. at our annual meeting of pacific island forum leaders in auckland earlier this month, we adopted a statement on ncds in which, among other things, we committed our governments to implementing five key interventions in areas known to reduce ncds controlling tobacco, improving diets, increasing physical activity, reducing alcohol intake and facilitating access to essential drugs and technologies. 17 11-51372 in that respect, tonga was pleased to join other member states in adopting the political declaration (resolution 662, annex) of the high-level meeting on the prevention and control of ncds. i sincerely believe that the meeting was a good step in the right direction for setting a healthier and enjoyable future for us all. we were pleased that the secretary-general was able to visit a number of countries in our region on his way to his historic attendance at the pacific islands forum. he was able to assess for himself the dominant impact of climate change on countries in the pacific and to validate the activities of pacific small island developing states tonga in international forums. we must use the positive foundations laid down collectively in copenhagen and cancún to embrace the promise that might lie in durban at the seventeenth conference of the parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change in december. we are pleased that, in july, under the able presidency of germany, the security council took solid steps to seize the moral imperative by holding an open debate and producing a presidential statement on the maintenance of international peace and security and the impact of climate change (sprst201115). the council and its membership, now and in the future, must not turn from their vigilant duty to keep themselves in a position of leadership over this issue and its implications for member states tonga and others in the pacific. while last years high-level meeting on mdgs offered small island developing states tonga an opportunity to take stock of their progress towards achieving those goals in 2015, we consider that we have a similar chance to do so as we all prepare for the united nations conference on sustainable development next year. we stress the critical importance of the sustainable development, management and conservation of our ocean and marine resources living and non-living as a proper source of livelihood and income for our communities and governments. ensuring that states ours enjoy a greater share of the benefits derived from such resources is key. what we within the pacific small island developing states have come to refer to as the blue economy will be our challenge to the rio conference to meet the expectations and development aspirations of our peoples. as such, tonga continues to observe its obligations under the united nations convention on the law of the sea and notes the decision taken by consensus by the states parties this year relating to the workload of the commission on the limits of the continental shelf, whose work is much valued by coastal states such as mine. tonga, together with another sister state from the region, again actively participated in the work of the international seabed authority this year and noted the decision by the authority to grant exploration licenses to entities sponsored by our respective governments. this represents a creative path for states mine, within the spirit of the convention, towards solid partnership and development. the common heritage of mankind, if it is to have any true meaning, ought to be common to all and not just to some or the few with the capacity in that area. tonga reiterates its call for the creation and definition of a formal small island developing states category within the united nations system. we are in need of a definition that is not based upon a one-size- fits-all approach. like others, we must have a definition that separates and addresses those states diversity of size, population, remoteness, isolation and different levels of socio-economic development. such a definition would not only improve linkages within the united nations system but also, we believe, set a good benchmark for the international community that is both coherent and practical. it would strengthen the position of the united nations and the international system in addressing small island developing states and the special and unique challenges they face. like others, we, too, welcome the republic of south sudan as our newest state member of the united nations. tonga has long been supportive of the efforts to find a comprehensive, just and enduring peace in the middle east. the shifting sands of change known as the arab spring throughout the surrounding region earlier this year has made such a peace and genuine security all the more challenging, but not impossible. this is indeed a moment of truth for those with genuine hope, not just for a secure israel and a viable palestine, but for those who for so long have had such hopes for an ambitious peace. tongas interest in developing renewable energy sources, within the context of our tonga energy road map, continued to evolve with our election to the council of the international renewable energy agency 11-51372 18 (irena) at the first session of the agencys assembly, in april 2011. we will work in earnest to ensure that the voices of developing states such as tonga and others on the new council are heard, given the key leading role it will play in the agencys decision- making and future direction. to take on such a role, irena must be prepared to be innovative. the agencys work will take on greater significance in the coming international year of sustainable energy for all and its related activities. i would also to recognize the strong support of the government of the united arab emirates as host state for irena. i am pleased to have addressed the assembly as the first democratically elected prime minister of tonga. in the wake of the elections held in november of last year, i took office the following month, in december, after an evolving process of principal reforms that, within the context of our 1875 constitution, included the peaceful transfer of executive power from his majesty in privy council to the government of the day; a parliament in which the majority of members are elected by universal suffrage; a prime minister elected by a majority of the elected members of parliament; a cabinet nominated by the prime minister and chosen largely from those elected members of parliament; a constitutional monarchy; and a strong and independent judiciary free of political influence. notwithstanding this peaceful evolution, the fundamental freedoms and values guaranteed under the constitution continue to afford legal protection and comforting reassurance to all tongans. to address the uncertain future of the current global economic and financial climate, my government has approved the tonga strategic development framework, which provides an overall framework to guide the governments activities for the next four years. it involves nine priority areas, from building strong, inclusive communities to improving health and education standards for a safe, secure and stable tongan society. earlier this month, my government signed separate agreements with the asian development bank and the world bank to improve information and communications technology services for tonga so as to make them affordable and accessible. improving such services will enable tonga to enhance its related education, health and government services as well. my government sincerely believes that this framework will put tonga on a firm path to improving its ability to meaningfully achieve the united nations millennium development goals by 2015. as such, in closing my government happily reaffirms its commitment to the principles of the charter of the united nations, and we pledge to support the ongoing work and reform of the organization.', 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

infrastructure project, the clang compiler, the swift programming language, a lot of key contributions to tensorflow and tpus as part of google. he served as vice president of autopilot software at tesla, was a software innovator and leader at apple, and now is at sci5, as a senior vice president of platform engineering, looking to revolutionize chip design to make it faster, better and cheaper. quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode. first sponsor is blinkist, an app that summarizes key ideas from thousands of books. i use it almost every day to learn new things or to pick which books i want to read or listen to next. second is neuro, the maker of functional sugar-free gum and mints that i use to supercharge my mind with caffeine, l-theanine and b vitamins. third is masterclass, online courses from the best people in the world on each of the topics covered, from rockets to game design to poker to writing and to guitar. and finally, cash app, the app i use to send money to friends for food, drinks and unfortunately lost bets. please check out the sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast. as a side note, let me say that chris has been an inspiration to me on a human level because he is so damn good as an engineer and leader of engineers, and yet he's able to stay humble, especially humble enough to hear the voices of disagreement and to learn from them. he was supportive of me and this podcast from the early days and for that i'm forever grateful. to be honest, most of my life, no one really believed that i would amount to much. so when another human being looks at me, it makes me feel i might be someone special, it can be truly inspiring. that's the lesson for educators. the weird kid in the corner with a dream is someone who might need your love and support in order for that dream to flourish. if you enjoy this thing, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcasts, follow on spotify, support on patreon, connect with me on twitter at lex friedman. and now here's my conversation with chris latner. what are the strongest qualities of steve jobs, elon musk and the great and powerful jeff dean since you've gotten the chance to work with each? you're starting with an easy question there. these are three very different people. i guess you could do maybe a pairwise comparison between them instead of a group comparison. so if you look at steve jobs and elon, i worked a lot more with elon than i did with steve. they have a lot of commonality. they're both visionary in their own way. they're both very demanding in their own way. my sense is steve is much more human factor focused where elon is more technology focused. what does human factor mean? steve is trying to build things that feel good, that people love, that affect people's lives, how they live. he's looking into the future a little bit in terms of what people want. where i think that elon focuses more on learning how exponentials work and predicting the development of those. steve worked with a lot of engineers. that was one of the things that are reading the biography and how can a designer essentially talk to engineers and get their respect? i think, so i did not work very closely with steve. i'm not an expert at all. my sense is that he pushed people really hard, but then when he got an explanation that made sense to him, then he would let go. and he did actually have a lot of respect for engineering but he also knew when to push. and when you can read people well, you can know when they're holding back and when you can get a little bit more out of them. and i think he was very good at that. i mean, if you compare the other folks, so jeff dean, right? jeff dean's an amazing guy. he's super smart as are the other guys. jeff is a really, really, really nice guy. well-meaning, he's a classic googler. he wants people to be happy. he combines it with brilliance so he can pull people together in a really great way. he's definitely not a ceo type. i don't think he would even want to be that. do you know if he still programs? oh yeah, he definitely programs. jeff is an amazing engineer today, right? and that has never changed. so it's really hard to compare jeff to either of those two. i think that jeff leads through technology and building it himself and then pulling people in and inspiring them. and so i think that that's one of the amazing things about jeff. but each of these people, with their pros and cons, all are really inspirational and have achieved amazing things. yes. i've been very fortunate to get to work with these guys. for yourself, you've led large teams. you've done so many incredible difficult technical challenges. is there something you've picked up from them about how to lead? yeah, well, so i mean, i think leadership is really hard. it really depends on what you're looking for there. i think you really need to know what you're talking about. so being grounded on the product, on the technology, on the business, on the mission is really important. being, understanding what people are looking for, why they're there. one of the most amazing things about tesla is the unifying vision, right? people are there because they believe in clean energy and electrification and all these kinds of things. the other is to understand what really motivates people, how to get the best people, how to build a plan that actually can be executed, right? there's so many different aspects of leadership and it really depends on the time, the place, the problems. there's a lot of issues that don't need to be solved. and so if you focus on the right things and prioritize well, that can really help move things. two interesting things you mentioned. one is you really have to know what you're talking about. how you've worked on a lot of very challenging technical things. so i kind of assume you were born technically savvy, but assuming that's not the case, how did you develop technical expertise? like even at google, you worked on, i don't know how many projects, but really challenging, very varied. compilers, tpus, hardware, cloud stuff, a bunch of different things. the thing that i've become comfortable as i've more comfortable with as i've gained experience is being okay with not knowing. and so a major part of leadership is actually, it's not about having the right answer, it's about getting the right answer. and so if you're working in a team of amazing people, right? and many of these places, many of these companies all have amazing people. it's the question of how do you get people together? how do you build trust? how do you get people to open up? how do you get people to be vulnerable sometimes with an idea that maybe isn't good enough, but it's the start of something beautiful? how do you provide an environment where you're not just top down, that'll do the thing that i tell you to do, right? but you're encouraging people to be part of the solution and providing a safe space where if you're not doing the right thing, they're willing to tell you about it, right? so you're asking dumb questions. yeah, dumb questions are my specialty. yeah, well, so i've been in the hardware realm recently and i don't know much at all about how chips are designed. i know a lot about using them. i know some of the principles and the artist technical level of this, but it turns out that if you ask a lot of dumb questions, you get smarter really quick. and when you're surrounded by people that wanna teach and learn themselves, it can be a beautiful thing. so let's talk about programming languages if it's okay. the highest absurd philosophical level. don't get romantic on me, lex. i will forever get romantic. and torch, i apologize. why do programming languages even matter? okay, well, thank you very much. so you're saying why should you care about any one programming language or why do we care about programming computers? no, why do we care about programming language design, creating effective programming languages, choosing a, one programming languages versus another programming language, why we keep struggling and improving through the evolution of these programming languages? sure, sure, sure. okay, so i mean, i think you have to come back to what are we trying to do here, right? so we have these beasts called computers that are very good at specific kinds of things and we think it's useful to have them do it for us, right? now you have this question of how best to express that because you have a human brain still that has an idea in its head and you wanna achieve something, right? so, well, there's lots of ways of doing this. you can go directly to the machine and speak assembly language and then you can express directly what the computer understands, that's fine. you can then have higher and higher and higher levels of abstraction up until machine learning and you're designing a neural net to do the work for you. the question is where along this way do you want to stop? and what benefits do you get out of doing so? and so programming languages in general, you have c, you have fortran, java, and ada, pascal, swift, you have lots of different things. they all have different trade-offs and they're tackling different parts of the problems. now, one of the things that most programming languages do is they're trying to make it so that you have pretty basic things portability across different hardware. so you've got, i'm gonna run on an intel pc, i'm gonna run on a risc-v pc, i'm gonna run on arm phone or something that, fine. i wanna write one program and have it portable. and this is something that assembly doesn't do. now, when you start looking at the space of programming languages, this is where i think it's fun because programming languages all have trade-offs and most people will walk up to them and they look at the surface level of syntax and say, , i curly braces or i tabs or i , you know, semicolons or not or whatever, right? it's fairly subjective, very shallow things. but programming languages, when done right, can actually be very powerful. and the benefit they bring is expression. okay, and if you look at programming languages, there's really kind of two different levels to them. one is the down in the dirt, nuts and bolts of how do you get the computer to be efficient, stuff that, how they work, type systems, compiler stuff, things that. the other is the ui. and the ui for programming language is really a design problem and a lot of people don't think about it that way. and the ui, you mean all that stuff with the braces and- yeah, all that stuff's the ui and what it is, and ui means user interface. and so what's really going on is it's the interface between the guts and the human. and humans are hard, right? humans have feelings, they have things they , they have things they don't . and a lot of people treat programming languages as though humans are just kind of abstract creatures that cannot be predicted. but it turns out that actually there is better and worse. like people can tell when a programming language is good or when it was an accident, right? and one of the things with swift in particular is that a tremendous amount of time by a tremendous number of people have been put into really polishing and making it feel good, but it also has really good nuts and bolts underneath it. you said that swift makes a lot of people feel good. how do you get to that point? so how do you predict that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are going to enjoy using the user experience of this programming language? well, you can look at it in terms of better and worse, right? so if you have to write lots of boilerplate or something that, you will feel unproductive. and so that's a bad thing. you can look at it in terms of safety. if c for example, is what's called a memory unsafe language. and so you get dangling pointers and you get all these kinds of bugs that then you have spent tons of time debugging and it's a real pain in the butt and you feel unproductive. and so by subtracting these things from the experience, you get happier people. but again, keep interrupting. i'm sorry. it's so hard to deal with. if you look at the people that are most productive on stack overflow, they have a set of priorities that may not always correlate perfectly with the experience of the majority of users. if you look at the most upvoted quote unquote, correct answer on stack overflow, it usually really sort of prioritizes safe code, proper code, stable code, that kind of stuff. as opposed to , if i wanna use go-to statements in my basic, right? i wanna use go-to statements. what if 99 of people wanna use go-to statements or use completely improper, unsafe syntax? i don't think that people actually, if you boil it down and you get below the surface level, people don't actually care about go-tos or if statements or things this. they care about achieving a goal. so the real question is, i wanna set up a web server and i wanna do a thing, whatever. like how quickly can i achieve that? and so from a programming language perspective, there's really two things that matter there. one is what libraries exist and then how quickly can you put it together and what are the tools around that look , right? and when you wanna build a library that's missing, what do you do? okay, now this is where you see huge divergence in the force between worlds, okay? and so you look at python, for example, python is really good at assembling things, but it's not so great at building all the libraries. and so what you get because of performance reasons, other things this is you get python layered on top of c, for example, and that means that doing certain kinds of things, well, it doesn't really make sense to do in python. instead you do it in c and then you wrap it and then you're living in two worlds and two worlds never is really great because tooling and the debugger doesn't work right and all these kinds of things. can you clarify a little bit what you mean by python is not good at building libraries, meaning it doesn't make it conducive. certain kinds of libraries. no, but just the actual meaning of the sentence. yeah. meaning it's not conducive to developers to come in and add libraries or the language or is it the duality of the, it's a dance between python and c and. so python's amazing. python's a great language. i did not mean to say that python is bad for libraries. what i meant to say is there are libraries that python's really good at that you can write in python, but there are other things. like if you want to build a machine learning framework, you're not going to build a machine learning framework in python because of performance, for example, or you want gpu acceleration or things this. instead what you do is you write a bunch of c or c code or something that and then you talk to it from python, right? and so this is because of decisions that were made in the python design and those decisions have other counterbalancing forces. but the trick when you start looking at this from a programming language perspective, did you sort of say, okay, cool. how do i build this catalog of libraries that are really powerful? and how do i make it so that then they can be assembled into ways that feel good and they generally work the first time? because when you're talking about building a thing, you have to include the debugging, the fixing, the turnaround cycle, the development cycle, all that kind of stuff in into the process of building the thing. it's not just about pounding out the code. and so this is where things , catching bugs at compile time is valuable, for example. but if you dive into the details in this, swift for example, has certain things value semantics, which is this fancy way of saying that when you treat a variable a value, it acts a mathematical object would. okay, so you have used pytorch a little bit. in pytorch you have tensors. tensors are n dimensional grid of numbers. very simple. you can do plus and other operators on them. it's all totally fine. but why do you need to clone a tensor sometimes? have you ever run into that? yeah. okay, and so why is that? why do you need to clone a tensor? it's the usual object thing that's in python. so in python, and just with java and many other languages, this isn't unique to python. in python it has a thing called reference semantics, which is the nerdy way of explaining this. and what that means is you actually have a pointer do a thing instead of the thing. okay, now this is due to a bunch of implementation details that you don't want to go into. but in swift you have this thing called value semantics. and so when you have a tensor in swift, it is a value. if you copy it, it looks you have a unique copy. and if you go change one of those copies, then it doesn't update the other one because you just made a copy of this thing. so that's highly error prone in at least computer science, math centric disciplines about python. that the thing you would expect to behave. like math. like math, it doesn't behave math. and in fact, quietly it doesn't behave math and then can ruin the entirety of your math thing. exactly, well and then it puts you in debugging land again. yeah. right, now you just want to get something done and you're , wait a second, where do i need to put clone? and what level of the stack, which is very complicated, which i thought i was reusing somebody's library and now i need to understand it to know where to clone a thing. and hard to debug, by the way. exactly, right. and so this is where programming languages really matter. so in swift having value semantics, so that both you get the benefit of math working math, but also the efficiency that comes with certain advantages there, certain implementation details there really benefit you as a programmer. can you clarify the value semantics, how do you know that a thing should be treated a value? yeah, so swift has a pretty strong culture and good language support for defining values. and so if you have an array, so tensors are one example that the machine learning folks are very used to. just think about arrays, same thing, where you have an array, you create an array, you put two or three or four things into it, and then you pass it off to another function. what happens if that function adds some more things to it? well, you'll see it on the side that you pass it in. this is called reference semantics. now, what if you pass an array off to a function, it scrolls it away in some dictionary or some other data structure somewhere. well, it thought that you just handed it that array, then you return back and that reference to that array still exists in the caller, and they go and put more stuff in it. the person you handed it off to may have thought they had the only reference to that, and so they didn't know that this was going to change underneath the covers. and so this is where you end up having to do clone. so i was passed a thing, i'm not sure if i have the only version of it, so now i have to clone it. so what value semantics does is it allows you to say, hey, i have a, so in swift, it defaults to value semantics. so it defaults to value semantics, and then because most things should be treated values, then it makes sense for that to be the default. and one of the important things about that is that arrays and dictionaries and all these other collections that are aggregations of other things also have value semantics. and so when you pass this around to different parts of your program, you don't have to do these defensive copies. and so this is great for two sides, right? it's great because you define away the bug, which is a big deal for productivity, the number one thing most people care about. but it's also good for performance, because when you're doing a clone, so you pass the array down to the thing, it's , i don't know if anybody else has it. i have to clone it. well, you just did a copy of a bunch of data. it could be big. and then it could be that the thing that called you is not keeping track of the old thing. so you just made a copy of it, and you may not have had to. and so the way the value semantics work in swift is that it uses this thing called copy on write, which means that you get the benefit of safety and performance. and it has another special trick, because if you think certain languages java, for example, they have immutable strings. and so what they're trying to do is they provide value semantics by having pure immutability. functional languages have pure immutability in lots of different places, and this provides a much safer model, and it provides value semantics. the problem with this is if you have immutability, everything is expensive. everything requires a copy. for example, in java, if you have a string x and a string y, you append them together. you have to allocate a new string to hold x, y. if they're immutable. and strings in java are immutable, and there's optimizations for short ones, and it's complicated. but generally, think about them as a separate allocation. and so when you append them together, you have to go allocate a third thing, because somebody might have a pointer to either of the other ones, and you can't go change them. so you have to go allocate a third thing. because of the beauty of how the swift value semantics system works out, if you have a string in swift, you say, hey, put in x, right? and they say, append on y, z, w, w, w. it knows that there's only one reference to that, and so can do an in-place update. and so you're not allocating tons of stuff on the side. you don't have all those problems. when you pass it off, you can know you have the only reference. if you pass it off to multiple different people, but nobody changes it, they can all share the same thing. so you get a lot of the benefit of purely immutable design, and so you get a really nice sweet spot that i haven't seen in other languages. yeah, that's interesting. i thought there was going to be a philosophical narrative here that you're going to have to pay a cost for it. it sounds , i think, value semantics is beneficial for easing of debugging or minimizing the risk of errors, bringing the errors closer to the source, bringing the symptom of the error closer to the source of the error, however you say that. but you're saying there's not a performance cost either, if you implement it correctly. well, so there's trade-offs with everything. and so if you are doing very low-level stuff, then sometimes you can notice costs. but then what you're doing is you're saying, what is the right default? so coming back to user interface, when you talk about programming languages, one of the major things that swift does that makes people love it that is not obvious when it comes to designing a language is this ui principle of progressive disclosure of complexity. so swift, many languages, is very powerful. the question is, when do you have to learn the power as a user? so swift, python, allows you to start with, print hello world. certain other languages start with public static void main class, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, zz, all the ceremony. and so you go to teach a new person, hey, welcome to this new thing. let's talk about public, access control, classes. wait, what's that? string, system.out, println, packages, , gah. and so instead, if you take this and you say, hey, we need packages, modules. we need powerful things classes. we need data structures. we need all these things. the question is, how do you factor the complexity? and how do you make it so that the normal case scenario is you're dealing with things that work the right way in the right way, give you good performance by default. but then as a power user, if you want to dive down to it, you have full c performance, full control over low level pointers. you can call malloc if you want to call malloc. this is not recommended on the first page of every tutorial, but it's actually really important when you want to get work done. and so being able to have that is really the design in programming language design. and design is really, really hard. it's something that i think a lot of people kind of, outside of ui, again, a lot of people just think is subjective. like there's nothing, you know, it's just curly braces or whatever. it's just somebody's preference. but actually good design is something that you can feel. and how many people are involved with good design? so if we look at swift, we'll look at historically. i mean, this might touch , it's almost a steve jobs question too, how much dictatorial decision making is required versus collaborative? and we'll talk about how that can go wrong or right. but yeah, well, swift, so i can't speak to in general, all design everywhere. so the way it works with swift is that there's a core team. and so core team is six or seven people-ish, something that, that is people that have been working with swift since the very early days. and so by early days is not that long ago. ok, yeah. so it became public in 2014. so it's been six years public now. but so that's enough time that there's a story arc there. and there's mistakes have been made that then get fixed and you learn something. and then you know, and so what the core team does is it provides continuity. and so you want to have a, ok, well, there's a big hole that we want to fill. we know we want to fill it. so don't do other things that invade that space until we fill the hole. there's a boulder that's missing here. we will do that boulder, even though it's not today. keep out of that space. and the whole team remembers the myth of the boulder that's there. yeah, yeah. there's a general sense of what the future looks in broad strokes and a shared understanding of that, combined with a shared understanding of what has happened in the past that worked out well and didn't work out well. the next level out is you have what's called the swift evolution community. and you've got, in that case, hundreds of people that really care passionately about the way swift evolves. and that's an amazing thing to, again, the core team doesn't necessarily need to come up with all the good ideas. you've got hundreds of people out there that care about something. and they come up with really good ideas, too. and that provides this rock tumbler for ideas. and so the evolution process is a lot of people in a discourse forum that are hashing it out and trying to talk about, ok, well, should we go left or right, or if we did this, what would be good? and here you're talking about hundreds of people. so you're not going to get consensus necessarily. you're not obvious consensus. and so there is a proposal process that then allows the core team and the community to work this out. and what the core team does is it aims to get consensus out of the community and provide guardrails, but also provide long-term, make sure we're going the right direction kind of things. so does that group represent how much people will love the user interface? do you think they're able to capture that? well, i mean, it's something we talk about a lot. it's something we care about. how well we do that is up for debate. but i think that we've done pretty well so far. is the beginner in mind? yeah. because you said the progressive disclosure of complexity. yeah, so we care a lot about that, a lot about power, a lot about efficiency, a lot about there are many factors to good design. and you have to figure out a way to kind of work your way through that. so if you think about the language i love is lisp, probably still because i use zmax. but i haven't done anything, any serious work in lisp. but it has a ridiculous amount of parentheses. yeah. i've also, with java and c, the braces, i enjoyed the comfort of being between braces. yeah, well, let's talk. and then python is really, sorry to interrupt, just , and last thing to me, as a designer, if i was a language designer, god forbid, is i would be very surprised that python with no braces would nevertheless somehow be comforting also. so i could see arguments for all of these. but look at this. this is evidence that it's not about braces versus tabs. right, exactly. you're good. that's a good point. right? so there's evidence that shows this. but see, it's one of the most argued about things. oh, yeah, of course. just tabs and spaces, which it doesn't, i mean, there's one obvious right answer. but it doesn't actually matter. what's that? come on, we're friends. like, come on. what are you trying to do to me here? people are going to, yeah, half the people are going to tune out. yeah. so you're able to identify things that don't really matter for the experience. well, no, no. it's always a really hard. so the easy decisions are easy. right? i mean, fine. those are not the interesting ones. the hard ones are the ones that are most interesting. right? the hard ones are the places where, hey, we want to do a thing. everybody agrees we should do it. there's one proposal on the table, but it has all these bad things associated with it. well, ok, what are we going to do about that? do we just take it? do we delay it? do we say, hey, well, maybe there's this other feature that if we do that first, this will work out better? if we do this, are we painting ourselves into a corner? right? and so this is where, again, you're having that core team of people that has some continuity and has perspective, has some of the historical understanding, is really valuable. because you get, it's not just one brain. you get the power of multiple people coming together to make good decisions. and then you get the best out of all these people. and you also can harness the community around it. what about the decision of whether, in python, having one type or having strict typing? yeah, ok. yeah, let's talk about this. so i how you put that, by the way. so many people would say that python doesn't have types. doesn't have types, yeah. but you're right. well, i've listened to you enough. i'm a fan of yours, and i've listened to way too many podcasts and videos of you talking about this. oh, yeah. so i would argue that python has one type. and so when you import python into swift, which, by the way, works really well, everything comes in as a python object. now, here are their trade-offs. because it depends on what you're optimizing for. and python is a super successful language for a really good reason. because it has one type, you get duck typing for free and things this. but also, you're making it very easy to pound out code, on the one hand. but you're also making it very easy to introduce complicated bugs that you have to debug. and you pass a string into something that expects an integer, and it doesn't immediately die. it goes all the way down the stack trace. and you find yourself in the middle of some code that you really didn't want to know anything about. and it blows up. and you're just saying, well, what did i do wrong? and so types are good and bad. and they have trade-offs. they're good for performance and certain other things, depending on where you're coming from. but it's all about trade-offs. and so this is what design is. design is about weighing trade-offs and trying to understand the ramifications of the things that you're weighing, types or not, or one type or many types. but also, within many types, how powerful do you make that type system is another very complicated question with lots of trade-offs. it's very interesting, by the way. but that's one dimension. and there's a bunch of other dimensions. jit compiled versus static compiled, garbage collected versus reference counted versus manual memory management versus all these different trade-offs and how you balance them are what make a program language good. concurrency. so in all those things, i guess, when you're designing the language, you also have to think of how that's going to get all compiled down to. if you care about performance. yeah. well, and go back to lisp. so lisp, also i would say javascript is another example of a very simple language. and so i also love lisp. i don't use it as much as maybe you do or you did. no, i think we're both. everyone who loves lisp, it's , you love, it's , i don't know, i love frank sinatra. but how often do i seriously listen to frank sinatra? sure. but you look at that or you look at javascript, which is another very different but relatively simple language. and there are certain things that don't exist in the language. but there is inherent complexity to the problems that we're trying to model. and so what happens to the complexity? in the case of both of them, for example, you say, well, what about large scale software development? well, you need something packages. neither language has a language affordance for packages. and so what you get is patterns. you get things npn. you get things these ecosystems that get built around. and i'm a believer that if you don't model at least the most important inherent complexity in the language, then what ends up happening is that complexity gets pushed elsewhere. and when it gets pushed elsewhere, sometimes that's great because often building things as libraries is very flexible and very powerful and allows you to evolve and things that. but often it leads to a lot of unnecessary divergence in the force and fragmentation. and when that happens, you just get kind of a mess. and so the question is, how do you balance that? don't put too much stuff in the language because that's really expensive and makes things complicated. but how do you model enough of the inherent complexity of the problem that you provide the framework and the structure for people to think about? so the key thing to think about with programming languages, and you think about what a programming language is there for, is it's about making a human more productive. and so there's an old, i think it's a steve jobs quote about it's a bicycle for the mind. you can definitely walk, but you'll get there a lot faster if you can bicycle on your way. a programming language is a bicycle for the mind? yeah. is it basically, wow, that's a really interesting way to think about it. by raising the level of abstraction, now you can fit more things in your head by being able to just directly leverage somebody's library. you can now get something done quickly. in the case of swift, swiftui is this new framework that apple has released recently for doing ui programming. and it has this declarative programming model which defines away entire classes of bugs. it builds on value semantics and many other nice swift things. and what this does is allows you to just get way more done with way less code. and now your productivity as a developer is much higher. right? and so that's really what programming languages should be about is it's not about tabs versus spaces or curly braces or whatever. it's about how productive do you make the person. and you can only see that when you have libraries that were built with the right intention that the language was designed for. and with swift, i think we're still a little bit early but swiftui and many other things that are coming out now are really showing that. and i think that they're opening people's eyes. it's kind of interesting to think about how that the knowledge of something of how good the bicycle is how people learn about that. so i've used c. now this is not going to be a trash talking session about c, but you c for a really long time. you can go there if you want. i have the scars. i feel i spent many years without realizing there's languages that could for my particular lifestyle, brain style, thinking style there's languages that could make me a lot more productive in the debugging stage, in the just the development stage and thinking the bicycle for the mind that i could fit more stuff into my. python's a great example of that, right? i mean, a machine learning framework in python is a great example of that. it's just very high abstraction level. and so you can be thinking about things on a very high level algorithmic level instead of thinking about, okay, well, am i copying this tensor to a gpu or not? right? it's not what you want to be thinking about. and as i was telling you, i mean, i guess the question i had is, you know, how does a person me or in general people discover more productive languages? like how i was, as i've been telling you offline i've been looking for a project to work on in swift so i can really try it out. i mean, my intuition was doing a hello world is not going to get me there. to get me to experience the power of the language. you need a few weeks to change your metabolism. exactly. i didn't think that beautifully, but that's one of the problems with people with diets. like i'm actually currently to go in parallel but in a small tangent is i've been recently eating only meat. okay. and okay. so most people are , think that's horribly unhealthy or whatever you have a million, whatever the science is, it just doesn't sound right. so back when i was in college, we did the atkins diet. that was a thing. similar. but you have to always give these things a chance. i mean, with dieting, i was not dieting but just the things that you . if i eat personally, if i eat meat, just everything, i can be super focused or more focused than usual. i just feel great. i've been running a lot, you know, doing pushups and posts and so on. i mean, python is similar in that sense for me. where are you going with this? i mean, literally, i just felt i had a stupid smile on my face when i first started using python. i could code up really quick things. like i would see the world. i'll be empowered to write a script to, you know, to do some basic data processing, to rename files on my computer. yeah. right. like perl didn't do that for me, a little bit. well, and again, none of these are about which is best or something that, but there's definitely better and worse here. but it clicks. well, yeah. and if you look at perl, for example, you get bogged down in scalars versus arrays versus hashes versus type globs and all that kind of stuff. and python's , yeah, let's not do this. and some of it is debugging. like everyone has different priorities. but for me, it's, can i create systems for myself that empower me to debug quickly? like i've always been a big fan, even just crude, asserts, always stating things that should be true, which in python, i found myself doing more because of type, all these kinds of stuff. well, you could think of types in a program language as being kind of assert. yeah. they could check the compile time, right? so how do you learn anything? well, so this or how do people learn new things, right? this is hard. people don't to change. people generally don't change around them either. and so we're all very slow to adapt and change. and usually there's a catalyst that's required to force yourself over this. so for learning a programming language really comes down to finding an excuse, build a thing that the language is actually good for, that the ecosystem is ready for. and so if you were to write an ios app, for example, that'd be the easy case. obviously you would use swift for that, right? there are other. android. so swift runs on android. oh, does it? oh, yeah. yeah, swift runs in lots of places. how does that work? ok, so swift is built on top of llvm. llvm runs everywhere. llvm, for example, builds the android kernel. oh, ok. so yeah. i didn't realize this. yeah, so swift is very portable. it runs on windows. it runs on lots of different things. and swift's side, it has swift ui. and then there's something called uikit. so can i build an app with swift? well, so that's the thing is the ecosystem is what matters there. so swift ui and uikit are apple technologies. ok, got it. and so swift ui happens to be written in swift, but it's an apple proprietary framework that apple loves and wants to keep on its platform, which makes total sense. you go to android, and you don't have that library. and so android has a different ecosystem of things that hasn't been built out and doesn't work as well with swift. and so you can totally use swift to do arithmetic and things this, but building a ui with swift on android is not a great example right now. so if i wanted to learn swift, what's the one practical different version of that is swift for tensorflow, for example. and one of the inspiring things for me with both tensorflow and pytorch is how quickly the community can switch from different libraries. you could see some of the communities switching to pytorch now, but it's very easy to see. and then tensorflow is really stepping up its game. and then there's no reason why. i think the way it works is basically there has to be one github repo. one paper steps up. it gets people excited. it gets people excited. and they're , , i have to learn this. swift for what? swift again? and then they learn it, and they fall in love with it. i mean, that's what happened. pytorch has the- there has to be a reason, a catalyst. and there, i mean, people don't change, but it turns out that once you've worked with one or two programming languages, the basics are pretty similar. and so one of the fun things about learning programming languages, even maybe lisp, i don't know if you agree with this, is that when you start doing that, you start learning new things. because you have a new way to do things, and you're forced to do them, and that forces you to explore. and it puts you in learning mode. and when you get in learning mode, your mind kind of opens a little bit, and you can see things in a new way, even when you go back to the old place. right. yeah, so with lisp, it's functional. yeah. but i wish there was a kind of window. maybe you can tell me if there is, there you go. this is a question to ask. what is the most beautiful feature in a programming language? before i ask it, let me say, with python, i remember when i saw lisp comprehensions. yeah. was , when i really took it in. yeah. i don't know, i just loved it. it was fun to do. it was fun to do that kind of, something about it, to be able to filter through a list, and to create a new list all in a single line was elegant. i could all get into my head, and it just made me fall in love with the language. so is there, let me ask you a question. is there, what do you use the most beautiful feature in a programming language that you've ever encountered? in swift, maybe, and then outside of swift? i think the thing that i the most from a programming language, so i think the thing you have to think about with a programming language, again, what is the goal? you're trying to get people to get things done quickly. and so you need libraries, you need high quality libraries, and then you need a user base around them that can assemble them and do cool things with them. and so to me, the question is, what enables high quality libraries? okay. yeah. and there's a huge divide in the world between libraries who enable high quality libraries versus the ones that put special stuff in the language. so programming languages that enable high quality libraries. high quality libraries, got it. so what i mean by that is expressive libraries that then feel a natural integrated part of the language itself. so an example of this in swift is that int and float, and also array and string, things this, these are all part of the library. like int is not hard-coded into swift. and so what that means is that because int is just a library thing defined in the standard library, along with strings and arrays and all the other things that come with the standard library, well, hopefully you do int, but anything that any language features that you needed to define int, you can also use in your own types. so if you wanted to find a quaternion or something this, right? well, it doesn't come in the standard library. there's a very special set of people that care a lot about this, but those people are also important. it's not about classism, right? it's not about the people who care about ints and fluids are more important than the people who care about quaternions. and so to me, the beautiful things about programming languages is when you allow those communities to build high-quality libraries that feel native, that feel they're built into the compiler without having to be. what does it mean for the int to be part of not hard-coded in? so is it , so what is an int? okay, int is just a integer. in this case, it's a 64-bit integer or something this. so the 64-bit is hard-coded or no? no, none of that's hard-coded. so int, if you go look at how it's implemented, it's just a struct in swift. and so it's a struct. and then how do you add two structs? well, you define plus. and so you can define plus on int. well, you can define plus on your thing too. you can define int as an is odd method or something that on it. and so, yeah, you can add methods on things. yeah. so you can define operators, how it behaves. that to you is beautiful when there's something about the language which enables others to create libraries which are not hacky. yeah, they feel native. and so one of the best examples of this is lisp, right? because in lisp, all the libraries are basically part of the language, right? you write term rewrite systems and things this. and so can you, as a counter example, provide what makes it difficult to write a library that's native? is it the python c? well, so one example, i'll give you two examples. java and c, or java and c. they both allow you to define your own types. but int is hard coded in the language. okay, well, why? well, in java, for example, coming back to this whole reference semantic value semantic thing, int gets passed around by value. yeah, that. but if you make a pair or something that, a complex number, right? it's a class in java, and now it gets passed around by reference, by pointer. and so now you lose value semantics, right? you lost math. okay, well, that's not great, right? if you can do something with int, why can't i do it with my type? yeah. right, so that's the negative side of the thing i find beautiful. is when you can solve that, when you can have full expressivity, where you as a user of the language have as much or almost as much power as the people who implemented all the standard built-in stuff. because what that enables is that enables truly beautiful libraries. you know, it's kind of weird because i've gotten used to that. that's one, i guess, other aspect of program language design. you have to think, you know, the old first principles thinking, , why are we doing it this way? by the way, i mean, i remember, because i was thinking about the wallace operator, and i'll ask you about it later, but it hit me that the equal sign for assignment. yeah. like, why are we using the equal sign for assignment? it's wrong, yeah. and that's not the only solution, right? so if you look at pascal, they use colon equals for assignment and equals for equality. and they use less than greater than instead of the not equal. yeah. like, there are other answers here. so, but , and yeah, i ask you all, but how do you then decide to break convention to say, you know what, everybody's doing it wrong. we're gonna do it right. yeah. so it's an roi, return on investment trade-off, right, so if you do something weird, let's just say not, colon equal instead of equal for assignment. that would be weird with today's aesthetic, right? and so you'd say, cool, this is theoretically better, but is it better in which ways? like, what do i get out of that? do i define away class of bugs? well, one of the class of bugs that c has is that you can use , you know, if x equals without equals equals if x equals y. yeah. right, well, turns out you can solve that problem in lots of ways, clang, for example, gcc, all these compilers will detect that as a, as a likely bug, produce a warning. do they? yeah. i feel they didn't, or clang doesn't. they didn't. gcc didn't, and it's , one of the important things about programming language design is , you're literally creating suffering in the world. okay. like, i feel , i mean, one way to see it is the bicycle for the mind, but the other way is to , minimizing suffering. well, you have to decide if it's worth it, right? and so let's come back to that. okay. but if you look at this, and again, this is where there's a lot of detail that goes into each of these things. equal in c returns a value. yep. that's messed up. that allows you to say x equals y equals z, that works in c. yeah. is it messed up? you know, most people think it's messed up, i think. it is very, by messed up, what i mean is, it is very rarely used for good, and it's often used for bugs. yeah. right, and so. that's a good definition of messed up, yeah. you could use, you know, it's a, in hindsight, this was not such a great idea, right? now, one of the things with swift that is really powerful, and one of the reasons it's actually good, versus it being full of good ideas, is that when we launched swift one, we announced that it was public, people could use it, people could build apps, but it was gonna change and break. okay. when swift 2 came out, we said, hey, it's open source, and there's this open process which people can help evolve and direct the language. so the community at large, swift users, can now help shape the language as it is, and what happened as part of that process is, a lot of really bad mistakes got taken out. so for example, swift used to have the c-style plus plus and minus minus operators. like, what does it mean when you put it before versus after? right? well, that got cargo-culted from c into swift, or really, i don't know. what's cargo-culted? cargo-culted means brought forward without really considering it. okay. this is maybe not the most pc term, but- you have to look it up in urban dictionary. yeah. yeah, so it got pulled into c without, or it got pulled into swift without very good consideration, and we went through this process, and one of the first things got ripped out was plus plus and minus minus, because they lead to confusion, they have very little value over saying x plus equals one, and x plus equals one is way more clear, and so when you're optimizing for teachability and clarity and bugs and this multidimensional space that you're looking at, things that really matter, and so being first principles on where you're coming from and what you're trying to achieve and being anchored on the objective is really important. well, let me ask you about the most, sort of this podcast isn't about information, it's about drama. so let me talk to you about some drama. so you mentioned pascal and colin equals there's something that's called the walrus operator, and python 3.8 added the walrus operator, and the reason i think it's interesting is not just because of the feature, it has the same kind of expression feature, you can actually see that it returns the value of the assignment, and maybe you can comment on that in general, but on the other side of it, it's also the thing that toppled the dictator. so it finally drove guido to step down from vdfl, the toxicity of the community. so maybe what do you think about the walrus operator in python, is there an equivalent thing in swift that really stress tested the community, and then on the flip side, what do you think about guido stepping down over it? yeah, well, if i look past the details of the walrus operator, one of the things that makes it most polarizing is that it's syntactic sugar. okay. what do you mean by syntactic sugar? it means you can take something that already exists in language, and you can express it in a more concise way. so okay, i'm gonna play double as advocate. so this is great. is that objective or subjective statement? can you argue that basically anything isn't syntactic sugar or not? no, not everything is syntactic sugar. so for example, the type system, can you have classes versus, do you have types or not? so one type versus many types is not something that affects syntactic sugar. and so if you say, i wanna have the ability to define types, i have to have all this language mechanics to define classes, and , now i have to have inheritance, and i have all this stuff. that's just making language more complicated. that's not about sugaring it. swift has sugar. so swift has this thing called if let, and it has various operars that are used to concisify specific use cases. so the problem with syntactic sugar, when you're talking about, hey, i have a thing that takes a lot to write, and i have a new way to write it, you have this horrible trade-off, which becomes almost completely subjective, which is how often does this happen and does it matter? and one of the things that is true about human psychology, particularly when you're talking about introducing a new thing, is that people overestimate the burden of learning something. and so it looks foreign when you haven't gotten used to it. but if it was there from the beginning, of course it's just part of python. like unquestionably, this is just the thing i know, and it's not a new thing that you're worried about learning. it's just part of the deal. now with guido, i don't know guido well. yeah, have you passed across much? yeah, i've met him a couple of times, but i don't know guido well. but the sense that i got out of that whole dynamic was that he had put the, not just the decision maker weight on his shoulders, but it was so tied to his personal identity that he took it personally and he felt the need and he kind of put himself in the situation of being the person, instead of building a base of support around him. i mean, this is probably not quite literally true. but by- too much, so there's too much- too much concentrated on him, right? and so- and that can wear you down. well, yeah, particularly because people then say, guido, you're a horrible person. i hate this thing, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. and sure, it's , you know, maybe 1 of the community that's doing that. but python's got a big community and 1 of millions of people is a lot of hate mail. and that, just from human factor, will just wear on you. well, to clarify, it looked from just what i saw in the messaging for the, let's not look at the million python users, but at the python core developers, it feels the majority, the big majority, on a vote were opposed to it. okay, i'm not that close to it, so i don't know what happened. okay, so the situation is literally, yeah, i mean, the majority of the core developers are against it. were opposed to it? and they weren't even against it. it was, there was a few, well, they were against it, but the against it wasn't , this is a bad idea. they were more , we don't see why this is a good idea. and what that results in is there's a stalling feeling. like you just slow things down. now, from my perspective, you could argue this, and i think it's very interesting if we look at politics today and the way congress works, it's slowed down everything. it's a dampener. yeah, it's a dampener, but that's a dangerous thing too, because if it dampens things , dampening results. what are you talking about? like it's a low pass filter, but if you need billions of dollars injected into the economy or trillions of dollars, then suddenly stuff happens, right? and so. for sure. so you're talking about. i'm not defending our political situation, just to be clear. but you're talking about a global pandemic. i was hoping we could fix the healthcare system and the education system, , you know. i'm not a politics person. i don't know. when it comes to languages, the community's kind of right in terms of, it's a very high burden to add something to a language. so as soon as you add something, you have a community of people building on it and you can't remove it. okay. and if there's a community of people that feel really uncomfortable with it, then taking it slow, i think is an important thing to do. and there's no rush, particularly if it was something that's 25 years old and is very established and, you know, it's not coming into its own. what about features? well, so i think that the issue with guido is that maybe this is a case where he realized that it had outgrown him and it went from being. the feature or the language. the language. so python, i mean, guido is amazing, but python isn't about guido anymore. it's about the users. and to a certain extent, the users own it. and, you know, guido has spent years of his life, a significant fraction of his career on python. and from his perspective, i imagine he's , well, this is my thing. i should be able to do the thing i think is right. but you can also understand the users where they feel , you know, this is my thing. i use this , and i don't know. it's a hard thing. oh, what? if we could talk about leadership in this, because it's so interesting to me. i'm gonna make, i'm gonna work. hopefully somebody makes it. if not, i'll make it a water-soprador shirt because i think it represents to me, maybe it's my russian roots or something. you know, it's the burden of leadership. like, i feel to push back, i feel progress can, most difficult decisions, just you said, there'll be a lot of divisiveness over, especially in a passionate community. it just feels leaders need to take those risky decisions that if you listen, that with some non-zero probability, maybe even a high probability would be the wrong decision, but they have to use their gut and make that decision. well, this is one of the things where you see amazing founders. the founders understand exactly what's happened and how the company got there and are willing to say, we have been doing thing x the last 20 years, but today we're gonna do thing y. and they make a major pivot for the whole company. the company lines up behind them, they move and it's the right thing. but then when the founder dies, the successor doesn't always feel that agency to be able to make those kinds of decisions. even though they're a ceo, they could theoretically do whatever. there's two reasons for that in my opinion. or in many cases, it's always different, but one of which is they weren't there for all the decisions that were made. and so they don't know the principles in which those decisions were made. and once the principles change, you should be obligated to change what you're doing and change direction, right? and so if you don't know how you got to where you are, it just seems gospel and you're not gonna question it. you may not understand that it really is the right thing to do, so you just may not see it. that's so brilliant. i never thought of it that way. it's so much higher burden when as a leader, you step into a thing that's already worked for a long time. yeah, yeah. well, and if you change it and it doesn't work out, now you're the person who screwed it up. people always second guess that. and the second thing is that even if you decide to make a change, even if you're theoretically in charge, you're just a person that thinks they're in charge. meanwhile, you have to motivate the troops, you have to explain it to them in terms they'll understand, you have to get them to buy into it and believe in it, because if they don't, then they're not gonna be able to make the turn, even if you tell them their bonuses are gonna be curtailed. they're just not gonna buy into it. and so there's only so much power you have as a leader and you have to understand what those limitations are. are you still bdfl? you've been a bdfl of some stuff. you're very heavy on the b, the benevolent, benevolent, dictated for life. i guess lvm? yeah, so i still lead the lvm world. i mean, what's the role of... so then on swift, you said that there's a group of people. yeah, so if you contrast python with swift, right? one of the reasons, so everybody on the core team takes the role really seriously, and i think we all really care about where swift goes, but you're almost delegating the final decision-making to the wisdom of the group, and so it doesn't become personal. and also when you're talking with the community, so yeah, some people are very annoyed at certain decisions that get made. there's a certain faith in the process because it's a very transparent process, and when a decision gets made, a full rationale is provided, things this. these are almost defense mechanisms to help both guide future discussions and provide case law, kind of the supreme court does, about this decision was made for this reason, and here's the rationale and what we wanna see more of or less of. but it's also a way to provide a defense mechanism so that when somebody's griping about it, they're not saying that person did the wrong thing. they're saying, well, this thing sucks, and later they move on and they get over it. yeah, the analogy of the supreme court, i think, is really good, but then, okay, not to get personal on the swift team, but is there division? it just seems it's impossible for division not to emerge. well, each of the humans on the swift core team, for example, are different, and the membership of the swift core team changes slowly over time, which is, i think, a healthy thing, and so each of these different humans have different opinions. trust me, it's not a singular consciousness of by any stretch of the imagination. you've got three major organizations, including apple, google, and sci-fi, all working together, and it's a small group of people, but you need high trust. again, it comes back to the principles of what you're trying to achieve and understanding what you're optimizing for, and i think that starting with strong principles and working towards decisions is always a good way to both make wise decisions in general, but then be able to communicate them to people so that they can buy into them, and that is hard. and so you mentioned llvm. llvm is gonna be 20 years old this december, so it's showing its own age. do you have a dragon cake plan? no, we should definitely do that. yeah, if we can have a pandemic cake. pandemic cake. everybody gets a slice of cake, and it gets sent through email. but llvm has had tons of its own challenges over time too, and one of the challenges that the llvm community has, in my opinion, is that it has a whole bunch of people that have been working at llvm for 10 years, because this happened somehow, and llvm has always been one way, but it needs to be a different way. and they've worked on it for 10 years, it's a long time to work on something, and you suddenly can't see the faults in the thing that you're working on. and llvm has lots of problems, and we need to address them, and we need to make it better, and if we don't make it better, then somebody else will come up with a better idea. and so it's just kind of of that age where the community is in danger of getting too calcified, and so i'm happy to see new projects joining, and new things mixing it up. fortran is now a new thing in the llvm community, which is hilarious and good. i've been trying to find, on this little tangent, find people who program in cobalt or fortran, fortran especially, to talk to, they're hard to find. yeah, look to the scientific community, they still use fortran quite a bit. well, interesting thing you kind of mentioned with llvm, or just in general, that if something evolved, you're not able to see the faults. so do you fall in love with the thing over time, or do you start hating everything about the thing over time? well, so my personal folly is that i see, maybe not all, but many of the faults, and they grate on me, and i don't have time to go fix them. yeah, and they get magnified over time. well, and they may not get magnified, but they never get fixed, and it's sand underneath, it's just grating against you, and it's sand underneath your fingernails or something, it's just you know it's there, you can't get rid of it. and so the problem is that if other people don't see it, nobody ever, i can't go, i don't have time to go write the code and fix it anymore, but then people are resistant to change, and so you say, hey, we should go fix this thing, they're , yeah, that sounds risky. well, is it the right thing or not? are the challenges the group dynamics, or is it also just technical? i mean, some of these features, i think as an observer, there's almost a fan in the, as a spectator of the whole thing, i don't often think about, some things might actually be technically difficult to implement. a example of this is we built this new compiler framework called mlir. yes. mlir is this, a whole new framework, it's not, many people think it's about machine learning, the ml stands for multi-level, because compiler people can't name things very well, i guess. can we dig into what mlir is? yeah, so when you look at compilers, compilers have historically been solutions for a given space. so llvm is a, it's really good for dealing with cpus, let's just say, at a high level. you look at java, java has a jvm, the jvm is very good for garbage collected languages that need dynamic compilation, and it's very optimized for specific space. and so hotspot is one of the compilers that gets used in that space, and that compiler is really good at that kind of stuff. usually when you build these domain specific compilers, you end up building whole thing from scratch, for each domain. what's a domain? so what's the scope of a domain? well, so here i would say, , if you look at swift, there's several different parts to the swift compiler, one of which is covered by the llvm part of it. there's also a high level piece that's specific to swift, and there's a huge amount of redundancy between those two different infrastructures, and a lot of re-implemented stuff that is similar but different. what does llvm define? llvm is effectively an infrastructure, so you can mix and match it in different ways, it's built out of libraries, you can use it for different things, but it's really good at cpus and gpus. cpus and the tip of the iceberg on gpus. it's not really great at gpus. okay. but it turns out- and a bunch of languages that- then use it to talk to cpus. got it. and so it turns out there's a lot of hardware out there that is custom accelerators. so machine learning, for example, there are a lot of matrix multiply accelerators and things this. there's a whole world of hardware synthesis. so we're using mlir to build circuits. okay. and so you're compiling for a domain of transistors. and so what mlir does is it provides a tremendous amount of compiler infrastructure that allows you to build these domain specific compilers in a much faster way and have the result be good. if we're thinking about the future, now we're talking about asics, so anything. yeah, yeah. so if we project into the future, it's very possible that the number of these kinds of asics, very specific infrastructure, architecture things, multiplies exponentially. i hope so. so that's mlir. so what mlir does is it allows you to build these compilers very efficiently. right now, one of the things that, coming back to the llvm thing, and then we'll go to hardware, is llvm is a specific compiler for a specific domain. mlir is now this very general, very flexible thing that can solve lots of different kinds of problems. so llvm is a subset of what mlir does. so mlir is, i mean, it's an ambitious project then. yeah, it's a very ambitious project, yeah. and so to make it even more confusing, mlir has joined the llvm umbrella project, so it's part of the llvm family. right. but where this comes full circle is now, folks that work on the llvm part, the classic part that's 20 years old, aren't aware of all the cool new things that have been done in the new thing, that mlir was built by me and many other people that knew a lot about llvm, and so we fixed a lot of the mistakes that lived in llvm. and so now you have this community dynamic where it's , well, there's this new thing, but it's not familiar, nobody knows it, it feels it's new, and so let's not trust it. and so it's just really interesting to see the cultural social dynamic that comes out of that. and i think it's super healthy because we're seeing the ideas percolate and we're seeing the technology diffusion happen as people get more comfortable with it, they start to understand things in their own terms. and this just gets to the, it takes a while for ideas to propagate, even though they may be very different than what people are used to. and maybe let's talk about that a little bit, the world of asics and- yeah. well, actually, you have a new role at sci5, what's that place about? what is the vision for their vision for, i would say the future of computing? yeah, so i lead the engineering and product teams at sci5. sci5 is a company who was founded with this architecture called risc-v. risc-v is a new instruction set, instruction sets are the things inside of your computer that tell it how to run things. x86 from intel and arm from the arm company and things this are other instruction sets. i've talked to, sorry, i'll talk to dave patterson who's super excited about risc-v. dave is awesome. yeah, he's brilliant. the risc-v is distinguished by not being proprietary. and so x86 can only be made by intel and amd, arm can only be made by arm, they sell licenses to build arm ships to other companies, things this. mips is another instruction set that is owned by the mips company, now wave, and then it gets licensed out, things that. and so risc-v is an open standard that anybody can build ships for. and so sci5 was founded by three of the founders of risc-v that designed and built it in berkeley, working with dave. and so that was the genesis of the company. sci5 today has some of the world's best risc-v cores and we're selling them and that's really great. they're going to tons of products, it's very exciting. so they're taking this thing that's open source and just trying to be or are the best in the world at building these things. yeah, so here it's the specifications open source. it's saying tcpip is an open standard or c is an open standard, but then you have to build an implementation of the standard. and so sci5 on the one hand pushes forward and defined and pushes forward the standard. on the other hand, we have implementations that are best in class for different points in the space, depending on if you want a really tiny cpu or if you want a really big beefy one that is faster but it uses more area and things this. what about the actual manufacturer? so what, where does that all fit? i'm going to ask a bunch of dumb questions. that's okay, this is how we learn, right? and so the way this works is that there's generally a separation of the people who design the circuits and then people who manufacture them. and so you'll hear about fabs tsmc and samsung and things this that actually produce the chips but they take a design coming in and that design specifies how the, you know, you turn code for the chip into little rectangles that then use photolithography to make a mask sets and then burn transistors onto a chip or onto a silicon rather. so, and we're talking about mass manufacturing. so- yeah, they're talking about making hundreds of millions of parts and things that. yeah, and so the fab handles the volume production, things that. but when you look at this problem, the interesting thing about the space, when you look at it is that these, the steps that you go from designing a chip and writing the quote unquote code for it and things verilog and languages that down to what you hand off to the fab is a really well studied, really old problem, okay? tons of people have worked on it. lots of smart people have built systems and tools. these tools then have generally gone through acquisitions. and so they've ended up at three different major companies that build and sell these tools. they're called eda tools for electronic design automation. the problem with this is you have huge amounts of fragmentation, you have loose standards and the tools don't really work together. so you have tons of duct tape and you have tons of loss productivity. now these are tools for designing. the risc-v is a instruction. like what is risc-v? like how deep does it go? how much does it touch the hardware? how much does it define? how much of the hardware is? yeah, so risc-v is all about given a cpu, so the processor and your computer, how does the compiler the swift compiler, the c compiler, things this, how does it make it work? so it's what is the assembly code? and so you write risc-v assembly instead of xa6 assembly, for example. but it's a set of instructions as opposed to- set of instructions, yeah. what do you say? it tells you how the compiler works. sorry, it's what the compiler talks to. okay. and then the tooling you mentioned, the disparate tools are for what? for when you're building a specific chip. so risc-v- in hardware. in hardware, yeah. so risc-v, you can buy a risc-v core from sci-v and say, hey, i wanna have a certain number of, run a certain number of gigahertz. i want it to be this big. i want it to be, have these features. i wanna have, , i want floating point or not, for example. and then what you get is you get a description of a cpu with those characteristics. now, if you wanna make a chip, you wanna build an iphone chip or something that. right, you have to take both the cpu, but then you have to talk to memory. you have to have timers, ios, a gpu, other components. and so you need to pull all those things together into what's called an asic, an application specific integrated circuit. so a custom chip. and then you take that design and then you have to transform it into something that the fabs, tsmc for example, know how to take to production. got it. so, but yeah, go ahead. and so that process, i will, i can't help but see it as, is a big compiler. yeah, it's a whole bunch of compilers written without thinking about it through that lens. and so- isn't the universe a compiler? in that, in what's a- yeah, compilers do two things. they represent things and transform them. yeah. and so there's a lot of things that end up being compilers. but this is a space where we're talking about design and usability and the way you think about things, the way things compose correctly, it matters a lot. and so scifi has been investing a lot into that space. and we think that there's a lot of benefit that can be made by allowing people to design chips faster, get them to market quicker and scale out because, the alleged end of moore's law, you've got this problem of, you're not getting free performance just by waiting another year for a faster cpu. and so you have to find performance in other ways. and one of the ways to do that is with custom accelerators and other things in hardware. and so, well, we'll talk a little more about asics, but do you see that a lot of people, a lot of companies will try to have different sets of requirements that this whole process to go for? so almost different car companies might use different, and different pc manufacturers. so is this, is risc-v in this whole process, is it potentially the future of all computing devices? yeah, i think that, so if you look at risc-v and step back from the silicon side of things, risc-v is an open standard. and one of the things that has happened over the course of decades, if you look over the long arc of computing, somehow became decades old. yeah. is that you have companies that come and go and you have instruction sets that come and go. like one example of this out of many is, sun with spark. yeah. sun went away, spark still lives on at fujitsu, but we have hp had this instruction set called pa-risc. so pa-risc was this big server business and had tons of customers. they decided to move to this architecture called itanium from intel. yeah. this didn't work out so well. yeah. right, and so you have this issue of you're making many billion dollar investments on instruction sets that are owned by a company. and even companies as big as intel don't always execute as well as they could. they have their own issues. hp, for example, decided that it wasn't in their best interest to continue investing in the space because it was very expensive. and so they make technology decisions or they make their own business decisions. and this means that as a customer, what do you do? you've sunk all this time, all this engineering, all the software work, all these, you've built other products around them and now you're stuck. right. what risc-v does is it provides you more optionality in the space, because if you buy an implementation of risc-v from sci-v, and you should, they're the best ones. yeah. but if something bad happens to sci-v in 20 years, right, well, great, you can turn around and buy risc-v cores from somebody else. and there's an ecosystem of people that are all making different risc-v cores with different trade-offs, which means that if you have more than one requirement, if you have a family of products, you can probably find something in the risc-v space that fits your needs. whereas if you're talking about xa6, for example, intel's only gonna bother to make certain classes of devices. i see. so maybe a weird question, but if sci-v is infinitely successful in the next 20, 30 years, what does the world look ? so , how does the world of computing change? so too much diversity in hardware instruction sets, i think is bad. like we have a lot of people that are using lots of different instruction sets, particularly in the embedded, the very tiny microcontroller space, the thing in your toaster, that are just weird and different for historical reasons. and so the compilers and the tool chains and the languages on top of them aren't there. and so the developers for that software have to use really weird tools because the ecosystem that supports is not big enough. so i expect that will change, right? people will have better tools and better languages, better features everywhere that then can serve us many different points in the space. and i think risc-v will progressively eat more of the ecosystem because it can scale up, it can scale down sideways, left, right. it's very flexible and very well considered and well-designed instruction set. i think when you look at sci-v tackling silicon and how people build chips, which is a very different space, that's where you say, i think we'll see a lot more custom chips. and that means that you get much more battery life, you get better tuned solutions for your iot thingy. you get people that move faster, you get the ability to have faster time to market, for example. so how many custom, so first of all, on the iot side of things, do you see the number of smart toasters increasing exponentially? so, and if you do, how much customization per toaster is there? do all toasters in the world run the same silicon, the same design, or is it different companies have different design? like how much customization is possible here? well, a lot of it comes down to cost. right, and so the way that chips work is you end up paying by the, one of the factors is the size of the chip. and so what ends up happening just from an economic perspective is there's only so many chips that get made in a year of a given design. and so often what customers end up having to do is they end up having to pick up a chip that exists, it was built for somebody else, so that they can then ship their product. and the reason for that is they don't have the volume of the iphone, they can't afford to build a custom chip. however, what that means is they're now buying an off the shelf chip that isn't really good, that isn't a perfect fit for their needs. and so they're paying a lot of money for it because they're buying silicon that they're not using. well, if you now reduce the cost of designing the chip, now you get a lot more chips and the more you reduce it, the easier it is to design chips. the more the world keeps evolving and we get more ai accelerators, we get more other things, we get more standards to talk to, we get 6g, right? you get changes in the world that you wanna be able to talk to these different things. there's more diversity in the cross product of features that people want. and that drives differentiated chips in another direction. and so nobody really knows what the future looks , but i think that there's a lot of silicon in the future. speaking of the future, you said moore's law allegedly is dead. so do you think, do you agree with dave patterson and many folks that moore's law is dead? or do you agree with jim keller who says, who's standing at the helm of the pirate ship saying, it's still alive. yeah. also, i agree with what they're saying and different people are interpreting the end of moore's law in different ways. yeah. so jim would say, there's another thousand x left in physics and we can continue to squeeze the stone and make it faster and smaller and smaller geometries and all that kind of stuff. he's right. so jim, i think you're right. so jim is absolutely right that there's a ton of progress left and we're not at the limit of physics yet. that's not really what moore's law is though. if you look at what moore's law is, is that it's a very simple evaluation of, okay, well, you look at the cost for, i think it was cost per area and the most economic point in that space. and if you go look at the now quite old paper that describes this, moore's law has a specific economic aspect to it. and i think this is something that dave and others often point out. and so on a technicality, that's right. i look at it from, so i can acknowledge both of those viewpoints. they're both right. they're both right. i'll give you a third wrong viewpoint that may be right in its own way, which is single threaded performance doesn't improve it used to. and it used to be back when you got a, you know, a pentium 66 or something. and the year before you had a pentium 33 and now it's twice as fast, right? well, it was twice as fast at doing exactly the same thing. okay. like literally the same program ran twice as fast. you just wrote a check, okay. and waited a year, a year and a half. well, so that's what a lot of people think about moore's law and i think that is dead. and so what we're seeing instead is we're pushing, we're pushing people to write software in different ways. and so we're pushing people to write cuda so they can get gpu compute and the thousands of cores on gpu. we're talking about c programmers having to use p threads because they now have, you know, a hundred threads or 50 cores in a machine or something that. you're not talking about machine learning accelerators. they're now domain specific. and when you look at these kinds of use cases, you can still get performance. and jim will come up with cool things that utilize the silicon in new ways for sure, but you're also gonna change the programming model. right. and now when you start talking about changing the programming model, that's when you come back to languages and things this too, because often what you see is , you take the c programming language, right? the c programming language is designed for cpus. and so if you wanna talk to a gpu, now you're talking to its cousin, cuda, okay. cuda is a different thing with a different set of tools, a different world, a different way of thinking. and we don't have one world that scales. and i think that we can get there. we can have one world that scales in a much better way. and a small tangent then, i think most programming languages are designed for cpus, for single core, even just in their spirit, even if they allow for parallelization. so what does it look for a programming language to have parallelization or massive parallelization as its first principle? so the canonical example of this is the hardware design world. so verilog, vhdl, these kinds of languages, they're what's called a high level synthesis language. this is the thing people design chips in. and when you're designing a chip, it's kind of a brain where you have infinite parallelism. like you're laying down transistors, transistors are always running, okay. and so you're not saying run this transistor, then this transistor, then this transistor. it's your brain, your neurons are always just doing something. they're not clocked, right? they're just doing their thing. and so when you design a chip or when you design a cpu, when you design a gpu, when you design, when you're laying down the transistors, similarly, you're talking about, well, okay, well, how do these things communicate? and so these languages exist. verilog is a kind of mixed example of that. none of these languages are really great either. they're very low level, yeah. yeah, they're very low level and abstraction is necessary here. and there's different approaches at that. and it's itself a very complicated world, but it's implicitly parallel. and so having that as the domain that you program towards makes it so that by default, you get parallel systems. if you look at cuda, cuda is a point halfway in the space where in cuda, when you write a cuda kernel for your gpu, it feels you're writing a scalar program. so you're , you have ifs, you have for loops, stuff this, you're just writing normal code. but what happens outside of that in your driver is that it actually is running you on a thousand things at once, right? and so it's parallel, but it has pulled it out of the programming model. and so now you as a programmer are working in a simpler world and it's solved that for you. how do you take the language swift? if we think about gpus, but also asics, maybe if we can dance back and forth between hardware and software. so, how do you design for these features to be able to program, make it a first-class citizen to be able to do swift for tensorflow to be able to do machine learning on current hardware, but also future hardware tpus and all kinds of asics that i'm sure will be popping up more and more. yeah, well, so a lot of this comes down to this whole idea of having the nuts and bolts underneath the covers that work really well. so you need, if you're talking to tpus, you need mlir or xla or one of these compilers that talks to tpus to build on top of. okay, and if you're talking to circuits, you need to figure out how to lay down the transistors and how to organize it and how to set up clocking and all the domain problems that you get with circuits. then you have to decide how to explain to a human. what is the ui? right, and if you do it right, that's a library problem, not a language problem. and that works if you have a library or a language which allows your library to write things that feel native in the language by implementing libraries, because then you can innovate in programming models without having to change your syntax again. and you have to invent new code formatting tools and all the other things that languages come with. and this gets really interesting. and so if you look at the space, the interesting thing, once you separate out syntax, becomes what is that programming model? and so do you want the cuda style, i write one program and it runs many places. do you want the implicitly parallel model? how do you reason about that? how do you give developers, chip architects, the ability to express their intent? and that comes into this whole design question of how do you detect bugs quickly? so you don't have to tape out a chip to find out it's wrong ideally, right? how do you, and this is a spectrum. how do you make it so that people feel productive? so their turnaround time is very quick. all these things are really hard problems. and in this world, i think that not a lot of effort has been put into that design problem and thinking about the layering in other pieces. well, you've on the topic of concurrency, you've written the swift concurrency manifest. i think it's kind of interesting. anything that has the word manifesto in is very interesting. can you summarize the key ideas of each of the five parts you've written about? so what is a manifesto? yes. how about we start there. so in the swift community, we have this problem, which is on the one hand, you wanna have relatively small proposals that you can kind of fit in your head. you can understand the details at a very fine grain level that move the world forward. but then you also have these big arcs, okay? and often when you're working on something that is a big arc, but you're tackling it in small pieces, you have this question of, how do i know i'm not doing a random walk? where are we going? how does this add up? furthermore, when you start that first small step, what terminology do you use? how do we think about it? what is better and worse in this space? what are the principles? what are we trying to achieve? and so what a manifesto in the swift community does is it starts to say, hey, well, let's step back from the details of everything and let's paint a broad picture to talk about how, what we're trying to achieve. let's give an example design point. let's try to paint the big picture so that then we can zero in on the individual steps and make sure that we're making good progress. and so the swift concurrency manifesto is something i wrote three years ago. it's been a while, maybe more. trying to do that for swift and concurrency. it starts with some fairly simple things making the observation that when you have multiple different computers or multiple different threads that are communicating, it's best for them to be asynchronous. and so you need things to be able to run separately and then communicate with each other. and this means asynchrony. and this means that you need a way to modeling asynchronous communication. many languages have features this. async await is a popular one. and so that's what i think is very likely in swift. but as you start building this tower of abstractions, it's not just about how do you write this? you then reach into the, how do you get memory safety? because you want correctness. you want debuggability and sanity for developers. and how do you get that memory safety into the language? so if you take a language go or c or any of these languages, you get what's called a race condition when two different threads or go routines or whatever touch the same point in memory, right? this is a huge maddening problem to debug because it's not reproducible generally. and so there's tools, there's a whole ecosystem of solutions that built up around this. but it's a huge problem when you're writing concurrent code. and so with swift, this whole value semantics thing is really powerful there because it turns out that math and copies actually work even in concurrent worlds. and so you get a lot of safety just out of the box, but there are also some hard problems and it talks about some of that. when you start building up to the next level up and you start talking beyond memory safety, you have to talk about what is the programmer model? how does a human think about this? so a developer that's trying to build a program to think about this and it proposes a really old model with a new spin called actors. actors are about saying we have islands of single threadedness logically. so you write something that feels it's one programming, one program running in a unit, and then it communicates asynchronously with other things. and so making that expressive and natural feel good, be the first thing you reach for and it being safe by default is a big part of the design of that proposal. when you start going beyond that, now you start to say, cool, well, these things that communicate asynchronously, they don't have to share memory. well, if they don't have to share memory and they're sending messages to each other, why do they have to be in the same process? these things should be able to be in different processes on your machine and why just processes? well, why not different machines? and so now you have a very nice gradual transition towards distributed programming. and of course, when you start talking about the big future, the manifesto doesn't go into it, but accelerators are things you talk to asynchronously by sending messages to them. and how do you program those? well, that gets very interesting. that's not in the proposal. and how much do you wanna make that explicit, the control of that whole process explicit to the program? yeah, good question. so when you're designing any of these kinds of features or language features or even libraries, you have this really hard trade off that you have to make, which is how much is it magic or how much is it in the human's control? how much can they predict and control it? what do you do when the default case is the wrong case? okay, and so when you're designing a system, i won't name names, but there are systems where it's really easy to get started and then you jump. so let's pick logo, okay? so something this. so it's really easy to start. it's really designed for teaching kids. but as you get into it, you hit a ceiling and then you can't go any higher. and then what do you do? well, you have to go switch to a different world and rewrite all your code. and this logo is a silly example here. this exists in many other languages. with python, you would say concurrency, right? so python has the global interpreter block. so threading is challenging in python. and so if you start writing a large scale application in python and then suddenly you need concurrency, you're kind of stuck with a series of bad trade-offs, right? there's other ways to go where you say , waste all the complexity on the user all at once, right? and that's also bad in a different way. and so what i prefer is building a simple model that you can explain that then has an escape hatch. so you get in, you have guardrails, memory safety works this in swift where you can start with by default, if you use all the standard things, it's memory safe. you're not gonna shoot your foot off. but if you wanna get a c level pointer to something, you can explicitly do that. but by default, there's guardrails. there's guardrails. okay, so, but , you know, whose job is it to figure out which part of the code is parallelizable? so in the case of the proposal, it is the human's job. so they decide how to architect their application. and then the runtime in the compiler is very predictable. and so this is in contrast to , there's a long body of work including on fortran for auto-parallelizing compilers. and this is an example of a bad thing. so as a compiler person, i can write on compiler people. often compiler people will say, cool, since i can't change the code, i'm gonna write my compiler that then takes this unmodified code and makes it go way faster on this machine. okay, application, and so it does pattern matching. it does really deep analysis. compiler people are really smart. and so they wanna do something really clever and tricky. and you get 10x speed up by taking an array of structures and turn it into a structure of arrays or something, because it's so much better for memory. like there's bodies, tons of tricks. yeah, they love optimization. yeah, you love optimization. everyone loves optimization. everyone loves it. well, and it's this promise of build with my compiler and your thing goes fast. yeah. right, but here's the problem. lex, you write a program. you run it with my compiler. it goes fast. you're very happy. wow, it's so much faster than the other compiler. then you go and you add a feature to your program or you refactor some code. and suddenly you got a 10x loss in performance. well, why? what just happened there? what just happened there is you, the heuristic, the pattern matching, the compiler, or whatever analysis it was doing just got defeated because you didn't inline a function or something, right? as a user, you don't know, you don't wanna know. that was the whole point. you don't wanna know how the compiler works. you don't wanna know how the memory hierarchy works. you don't wanna know how it got parallelized across all these things. you wanted that abstract away from you. but then the magic is lost as soon as you did something and you fall off a performance cliff. and now you're in this funny position where, what do i do? i don't change my code. i don't fix that bug. it costs 10x performance. now what do i do? well, this is the problem with unpredictable performance. if you care about performance, predictability is a very important thing. and so what the proposal does is it provides architectural patterns for being able to lay out your code, gives you full control over that, makes it really simple so you can explain it. and then if you wanna scale out in different ways, you have full control over that. so in your sense, the intuition is for a compiler is too hard to do automated parallelization. like, you know, cause the compilers do stuff automatically that's incredibly impressive for other things. but for parallelization, we're not even, we're not close to there. well, it depends on the programming model. so there's many different kinds of compilers. and so if you talk about a c compiler, a swift compiler or something that, where you're writing imperative code, parallelizing that and reasoning about all the pointers and stuff that is a very difficult problem. now, if you switch domains, so there's this cool thing called machine learning, right? so machine learning nerds among other endearing things solving cat detectors and other things that have done this amazing breakthrough of producing a programming model, operations that you compose together that has raised levels of abstraction high enough that suddenly you can have auto-parallelizing compilers. or you can write a model using a tensorflow and have it run on 1024 nodes of a tpu. yeah, that's true, i didn't even think about , you know, cause there's so much flexibility in the design of architectures that ultimately boil down to a graph that's parallelizable for you, parallelized for you. and if you think about it, that's pretty cool. that's pretty cool, yeah. and you think about batching, for example, as a way of being able to exploit more parallelism. like that's a very simple thing that now is very powerful. that didn't come out of the programming language nerds, right, those people. like that came out of people that are just looking to solve a problem and use a few gpus and organically developed by the community of people focusing on machine learning. and it's an incredibly powerful abstraction layer that enables the compiler people to go and exploit that. and now you can drive supercomputers from python. that's pretty cool. that's amazing, so just to pause on that, cause i'm not sufficiently low level. i forget to admire the beauty and power of that. but maybe just to linger on it, what does it take to run in your network fast? like how hard is that compilation? it's really hard. so we just skipped, you said it's amazing that that's a thing, but how hard is that of a thing? it's hard, and i would say that not all of the systems are really great, including the ones i helped out. so there's a lot of work left to be done there. is it the compiler nerds working on that, or is it a whole new group of people? well, it's a full stack problem, including compiler people, including apis, so keras and the module api and pytorch and jax, and there's a bunch of people pushing on all the different parts of these things. because when you look at it as it's both, how do i express the computation? do i stack up layers? well, cool, setting up a linear sequence of layers is great for the simple case, but how do i do the hard case? how do i do reinforcement learning? well, now i need to integrate my application logic in this. then it's the next level down of how do you represent that for the runtime, how do you get hardware abstraction? and then you get to the next level down of saying, forget about abstraction, how do i get the peak performance out of my tpu or my iphone accelerator or whatever, right? and all these different things. and so this is a layered problem with a lot of really interesting design and work going on in the space and a lot of really smart people working on it. machine learning is a very well-funded area of investment right now, and so there's a lot of progress being made. so how much innovation is there on the lower level? so closer to the asic, so redesigning the hardware or redesigning concurrently compilers with that hardware. is that, if you were to predict the biggest, the equivalent of moore's law improvements in the inference and the training of neural networks and just all of that, where is that gonna come from, you think? sure, you get scalability of different things. and so you get jim keller shrinking process technology, you get three nanometer instead of five or seven or 10 or 28 or whatever. and so that marches forward and that provides improvements. you get architectural level performance. and so the tpu with a matrix multiply unit and a systolic array is much more efficient than having a scalar core doing multiplies and adds and things that. you then get system level improvements. so how you talk to memory, how you talk across a cluster of machines, how you scale out, how you have fast interconnects between machines, you then get system level programming models. so now that you have all this hardware, how to utilize it. you then have algorithmic breakthroughs where you say, hey, wow, cool. instead of training in a resident 50 in a week, i'm now training it in 25 seconds. and it's a combination of new optimizers and new just training regimens and different approaches to train. and all of these things come together to push the world forward. that was a beautiful exposition. but if you were to force to bet all your money on one of these. why do we have to? unfortunately, we have people working on all this. it's an exciting time, right? so i mean, openai did this little paper show on the algorithmic improvement you can get. it's been improving exponentially. i haven't quite seen the same kind of analysis on other layers of the stack. i'm sure it's also improving significantly. i just, it's a nice intuition builder. i mean, there's a reason why moore's law, that's the beauty of moore's law is somebody writes a paper that makes a ridiculous prediction. and it becomes reality in a sense. there's something about these narratives when you, when chris latner on a silly little podcast makes, bets all his money on a particular thing, somehow it can have a ripple effect of actually becoming real. that's an interesting aspect of it. cause , it might've been, you know, we focused with moore's law, most of the computing industry really, really focused on the hardware. i mean, software innovation, i don't know how much software innovation there was in terms of efficiency. i mean, it's a question till giveth, bill takes away. yeah. i mean, compiler has improved significantly also. well, not, not really. so actually, i mean, i'm joking about how software's gotten slower pretty much as fast as hardware got better, at least through the nineties. there's another joke, another law in compilers, which is called, i think it's called probstein's law, which is compilers double the performance of any given code every 18 years. so they move slowly. yeah. well, yeah, it's exponential also. yeah, you're making progress, but there, again, it's not about, the power of compilers is not just about how do you make the same thing go faster. it's how do you unlock the new hardware? a new chip came out, how do you utilize it? you say, , the programming model, how do we make people more productive? how do we, how do we have better error messages? even such mundane things that, such mundane things how do i generate a very specific error message about your code actually makes people happy, because then they know how to fix it, right? and it comes back to how do you help people get their job done? yeah, and yeah, and then in this world of exponentially increasing smart toasters, how do you expand computing to all these kinds of devices? do you see this world where just everything's a computing surface? you see that possibility? just everything's a computer? yeah, i don't see any reason that that couldn't be achieved. it turns out that sand goes into glass, and glass is pretty useful too. and, you know, why not? why not? so, very important question then, if we're living in a simulation and the simulation is running a computer, what's the architecture of that computer, do you think? hmm. so you're saying is it a quantum system? is it a- yeah, this whole quantum discussion, is it needed? or can we run it on a, you know, with a risc-v architecture, a bunch of cpus? i think it comes down to the right tool for the job. yeah, and so- and what's the compiler? yeah, exactly, that's my question. did i get that job? it'd be the universe compiler. and so there, as far as we know, quantum systems are the bottom of the pile of turtles so far. and so we don't know efficient ways to implement quantum systems without using quantum computers. yeah, and that's totally outside of everything we've talked about, quantum computers. but who runs that quantum computer? yeah. right, so if we really are living in a simulation, then is it bigger quantum computers? is it different ones? like, how does that work out? how does that scale? well, it's the same size, it's the same size. but then the thought of the simulation is that you don't have to run the whole thing, that we humans are cognitively very limited. you do checkpoints. you do checkpoints, yeah. and if we, the point at which we human, so you basically do minimal amount of, what is it, swift does on write, copy on write. so you only adjust the simulation every- parallel universe theories, right? and so every time a decision's made, somebody opens the shortening of your box, then there's a fork, and this could happen. and then, thank you for considering the possibility. but yeah, so it may not require the entirety of the universe to simulate it. but it's interesting to think about as we create these higher and higher fidelity systems. but i do wanna ask on the quantum computer side, because everything we've talked about, whether you work with sci-fi, with compilers, none of that includes quantum computers, right? that's true. so, jeff, have you ever thought about what, this whole serious engineering work of quantum computers looks of compilers, of architectures, all that kind of stuff? so i've looked at it a little bit. i know almost nothing about it, which means that at some point, i will have to find an excuse to get involved, because that's how it works. do you think that's a thing to be, , with your little tingly senses of the timing of when to be involved, is it not yet? well, so the thing i do really well is i jump into messy systems and figure out how to make them, figure out what the truth in the situation is, try to figure out what the unifying theory is, how to factor the complexity, how to find a beautiful answer to a problem that has been well studied, and lots of people have bashed their heads against it. i don't know that quantum computers are mature enough and accessible enough to be figured out yet, right? and i think the open question with quantum computers is, is there a useful problem that gets solved with quantum computer that makes it worth the economic cost of, , having one of these things and having legions of people that set it up? you go back to the 50s, right, and there's the projections of the world will only need seven computers, right? well, and part of that was that people hadn't figured out what they're useful for. what are the algorithms we want to run? what are the problems that get solved? and this comes back to how do we make the world better either economically or making somebody's life better or, , solving a problem that wasn't solved before, things this. and i think that just we're a little bit too early in that development cycle because it's still, , literally a science project, not a negative connotation, right? it's literally a science project. and the progress there's amazing. and so i don't know if it's 10 years away, if it's two years away, exactly where that breakthrough happens. but you look at machine learning, we went through a few winners before the alexnet transition, and then suddenly it had its breakout moment. and that was the catalyst that then drove the talent flocking into it. that's what drove the economic applications of it. that's what drove the technology to go faster because you now have more minds thrown at the problem. this is what caused a serious knee in deep learning and the algorithms that we're using. and so i think that's what quantum needs to go through. and so right now it's in that formidable finding itself, getting the, , literally the physics figured out. and then it has to figure out the application that makes this useful. yeah, but i'm not skeptical. i think that will happen. i think it's just, you know, 10 years away, something that. i forgot to ask, what programming language do you think the simulation is written in? ooh, probably lisp. so not swift. like if you were to bet, i'll just leave it at that. so, i mean, we've mentioned that you worked with all these companies, we've talked about all these projects. it's kind of if we just step back and zoom out about the way you did that work, and we look at covid times, this pandemic we're living through, that may, if i look at the way silicon valley folks are talking about it, the way mit is talking about it, this might last for a long time. not just the virus, but the remote nature. the economic impact. i mean, yeah, it's gonna be a mess. do you think, what's your prediction? i mean, from sci-fi to google to just all the places you worked in, just silicon valley, you're in the middle of it. what do you think is, how is this whole place gonna change? yeah, so, i mean, i really can only speak to the tech perspective. i am in that bubble. i think it's gonna be really interesting because the zoom culture of being remote and on video chat all the time has really interesting effects on people. so on the one hand, it's a great normalizer. it's a normalizer that i think will help communities of people that have traditionally been underrepresented because now you're taking, in some cases, a face off because you don't have to have a camera going. right, and so you can have conversations without physical appearance being part of the dynamic, which is pretty powerful. you're taking remote employees that have already been remote and you're saying you're now on the same level and footing as everybody else. nobody gets whiteboards. you're not gonna be the one person that doesn't get to be participating in the whiteboard conversation and that's pretty powerful. you've got, you're forcing people to think asynchronously in some cases because it's harder to just get people physically together and the bumping into each other forces people to find new ways to solve those problems and i think that that leads to more inclusive behavior, which is good. on the other hand, it's also, it just sucks. right, and so. the nature, the actual communication or it just sucks being not with people on a daily basis and collaborating with them. yeah, all of that. i mean, everything, this whole situation is terrible. what i meant primarily was the, i think that most humans working physically with humans. i think this is something that not everybody, but many people are programmed to do and i think that we get something out of that that is very hard to express, at least for me, and so maybe this isn't true of everybody. but, and so the question to me is, when you get through that time of adaptation, you get out of march and april and you get into december and you get into next march if it's not changed, right? it's already terrifying. well, you think about that and you think about what is the nature of work and how do we adapt and humans are very adaptable species, right? we can learn things and when we're forced to and there's a catalyst to make that happen. and so what is it that comes out of this and are we better or worse off, right? i think that, you know, you look at the bay area, housing prices are insane. well, why? well, there's a high incentive to be physically located because if you don't have proximity, you end up paying for it and commute, right? and there has been huge social pressure in terms of, you will be there for the meeting, right? or whatever scenario it is. and i think that's gonna be way better. i think it's gonna be much more than normed to have remote employees. and i think this is gonna be really great. do you have friends or do you hear of people moving? i know one family friend that moved. they moved back to michigan and, you know, they were a family with three kids living in a small apartment and , we're going insane. right, and they're in tech, husband works for google. so first of all, friends of mine are in the process of, or have already lost the business. the thing that represents their passion, their dream. it could be small entrepreneur projects, but it can be large businesses, people that run gyms, do- restaurants, tons of things, yeah. but also, people look at themselves in the mirror and ask the question of , what do i wanna do in life? for some reason they haven't done it until covid. like, they really ask that question and that results often in moving or leaving the company or with starting your own business or transitioning to different company. do you think we're gonna see that a lot? like in- i, well, i can't speak to that. i mean, we're definitely gonna see it at a higher frequency than we did before, just because i think what you're trying to say is, there are decisions that you make yourself and big life decisions that you make yourself and , i'm gonna quit my job and start a new thing. there's also decisions that get made for you. like, i got fired from my job. what am i gonna do, right? and that's not a decision that you think about, but you're forced to act, okay? and so, i think that those, you're forced to act kind of moments where , global pandemic comes and wipes out the economy and now your business doesn't exist. i think that does lead to more reflection, right? because you're less anchored on what you have and it's not a, what do i have to lose versus what do i have to gain, a, b comparison. it's more of a fresh slate, cool. i could do anything now. do i wanna do the same thing i was doing? did that make me happy? is this now time to go back to college and take a class and learn a new skill? is this a time to spend time with family? if you can afford to do that, is this time to , literally move in with the parents, right? i mean, all these things that were not normative before suddenly become, i think, very, the value system has changed. and i think that's actually a good thing in the short term at least, because it leads to, you know, there's kind of been an over optimization along one set of priorities for the world. and now maybe we'll get to a more balanced and more interesting world where people are doing different things. i think it could be good. i think there could be more innovation that comes out of it, for example. what do you think about all the social chaos in the middle of - it sucks. you think it's, let me ask you, i hope you think it's all gonna be okay? well, i think humanity will survive. the, from the next extension, look, we're not all gonna kill, yeah, well. yeah, i don't think the virus is gonna kill all the humans. i don't think all the humans are gonna kill all the humans. i think that's unlikely, but i look at it as progress requires a catalyst, right? so you need a reason for people to be willing to do things that are uncomfortable. i think that the us at least, but i think the world in general is a pretty unoptimal place to live in for a lot of people. and i think that what we're seeing right now is we're seeing a lot of unhappiness. and because of all the pressure, because of all the badness in the world that's coming together, it's really kind of igniting some of that debate that should have happened a long time ago, right? i mean, i think that we'll see more progress. you're asking about offline, you're asking about politics and wouldn't it be great if politics moved faster because there's all these problems in the world and we can move it. well, people are inherently conservative. and so if you're talking about conservative people, particularly if they have heavy burdens on their shoulders because they represent literally thousands of people, it makes sense to be conservative. but on the other hand, when you need change, how do you get it? the global pandemic will probably lead to some change and it's not a directed plan, but i think that it leads to people asking really interesting questions. and some of those questions should have been asked a long time ago. well, let me know if you've observed this as well. something that's bothered me in the machine learning community, i'm guessing it might be prevalent in other places, is something that feels in 2020, increase level of toxicity. like people are just quicker to pile on to just be, they're just harsh on each other, to mob, pick a person that screwed up and make it a big thing. and is there something that we can , yeah, have you observed that in other places? is there some way out of this? i think there's an inherent thing in humanity that's kind of an us versus them thing, which is that you wanna succeed and how do you succeed? well, it's relative to somebody else. and so what's happening, at least in some part, is that with the internet and with online communication, the world's getting smaller, right? and so we're having some of the social ties of my town versus your town's football team, right? turn into much larger and yet shallower problems. and people don't have time, the incentives, click bait and all these things kind of really, really feed into this machine and i don't know where that goes. yeah, i mean, the reason i think about that, i mentioned to you this offline a little bit, but i have a few difficult conversations scheduled, some of them political related, some of them within the community, difficult personalities that went through some stuff. i mean, one of them i've talked before, i will talk again is yann lecun. he got a little bit of crap on twitter for talking about a particular paper and the bias within a data set. and then there's been a huge, in my view, and i'm only comfortable saying it, irrational, over-exaggerated pile on his comments because he made pretty basic comments about the fact that if there's bias in the data, there's going to be bias in the results. so we should not have bias in the data. but people piled on to him because he said he trivialized the problem of bias. it's a lot more than just bias in the data. but yes, that's a very good point, but that's- that's not what he was saying. that's not what he was saying. and the response, the implied response that he's basically sexist and racist is something that completely drives away the possibility of nuanced discussion. one nice thing about a podcast long form conversation is you can talk it out, you can lay your reasoning out. even if you're wrong, you can still show that you're a good human being underneath it. your point about you can't have a productive discussion. well, how do you get to that point where people can turn? they can learn, they can listen, they can think, they can engage versus just being a shallow , and then keep moving, right? and i don't think that progress really comes from that, right? and i don't think that one should expect that. i think that you'd see that as reinforcing individual circles and the us versus them thing. and i think that's fairly divisive. yeah, i think there's a big role in, the people that bother me most on twitter when i observe things is not the people who get very emotional, angry, over the top. it's the people who prop them up. it's all the, it's that, i think what should be the, we should teach each other is to be sort of empathetic. the thing that it's really easy to forget, particularly on twitter or the internet or an email is that sometimes people just have a bad day, right? you have a bad day or you're , i've been in the situation where it's between meetings, fire off a quick response to an email because i wanna help get something unblocked. phrase it really objectively wrong. i screwed up and suddenly this is now something that sticks with people. and it's not because they're bad. it's not because you're bad. just psychology of , you said a thing, it sticks with you. you didn't mean it that way, but it really impacted somebody because the way they interpret it. and this is just an aspect of working together as humans. and i have a lot of optimism in the longterm, the very longterm about what we as humanity can do. but i think that's gonna be, it's just always a rough ride. and you came into this by saying , what is covid and all the social strife that's happening right now mean? and i think that it's really bad in the short term, but i think it'll lead to progress. and for that, i'm very thankful. yeah, it's painful in the short term though. well, yeah, i mean, people are out of jobs. like some people can't eat, it's horrible. and, but it's progress. so we'll see what happens. i mean, the real question is when you look back 10 years, 20 years, 100 years from now, how do we evaluate the decisions that are being made right now? i think that's really the way you can frame that and look at it. and you say, you integrate across all the short term horribleness that's happening and you look at what that means. and is the improvement across the world or the regression across the world significant enough to make it a good or a bad thing? i think that's the question. yeah, and for that, it's good to study history. i mean, one of the big problems for me right now is i'm reading the rise and fall of the third reich. okay, light reading. so as everything is just, i just see parallels and it means you have to be really careful not to overstep it, but just the thing that worries me the most is the pain that people feel when a few things combine, which is economic depression, which is quite possible in this country, and then just being disrespected in some kind of way, which the german people were really disrespected by most of the world, in a way that's over the top, that something can build up and then all you need is a charismatic leader to go either positive or negative and both work as long as they're charismatic. and there's- it's taking advantage of, again, that inflection point that the world's in and what they do with it could be good or bad. and so it's a good way to think about times now, on an individual level, what we decide to do is when history is written, 30 years from now, what happened in 2020, probably history is gonna remember 2020. yeah, i think so. either for good or bad, and it's up to us to write it so it's good. well, one of the things i've observed that i find fascinating is most people act as though the world doesn't change. you make decisions, knowingly, you make a decision where you're predicting the future based on what you've seen in the recent past. and so if something's always been, it's rained every single day, then of course you expect it to rain today too, right? on the other hand, the world changes. all the time. constantly, for better and for worse. and so the question is, if you're interested in something that's not right, what is the inflection point that led to a change? and you can look to history for this. what is the catalyst that led to that explosion that led to that bill that led to the... you can kind of work your way backwards from that, and maybe if you pull together the right people and you get the right ideas together, you can actually start driving that change and doing it in a way that's productive and hurts fewer people. yeah, a single person, a single event can turn all of this. absolutely, everything starts somewhere. and often it's a combination of multiple factors, but yeah, these things can be engineered. that's actually the optimistic view that... i'm a long-term optimist on pretty much everything, and human nature, we can look to all the negative things that humanity has, all the pettiness and all the self-servingness and just the cruelty, right? the biases, humans can be very horrible, but on the other hand, we're capable of amazing things. and the progress across 100-year chunks is striking. and even across decades, we've come a long ways, and there's still a long ways to go, but that doesn't mean that we've stopped. yeah, the kind of stuff we've done in the last 100 years is unbelievable. it's kind of scary to think what's gonna happen in the next 100 years. it's scary, exciting. scary in a sense that it's kind of sad that the kind of technology is gonna come out in 10, 20, 30 years. we're probably too old to really appreciate because you don't grow up with it. it'll be kids these days with their virtual reality and their... their tiktoks and stuff this, , , there's this thing, and , come on, give me my static photo. my commodore 64, yeah. yeah, exactly. okay, sorry, we kind of skipped over. let me ask on, you know, the machine learning world has been kind of inspired, their imagination captivated with gpt-3 and these language models. i thought it'd be cool to get your opinion on it. what's your thoughts on this exciting world of... it connects to computation, actually, of language models that are huge and take many, many computers, not just to train, but to also do inference on. sure. well, i mean, it depends on what you're speaking to there, but i mean, i think that there's been a pretty well-understood maximum deep learning that if you make the model bigger and you shove more data into it, assuming you train it right and you have a good model architecture, that you'll get a better model out. and so on the one hand, gpt-3 was not that surprising. on the other hand, a tremendous amount of engineering went into making it possible. the implications of it are pretty huge. i think that when gpt-2 came out, there was a very provocative blog post from openai talking about, you know, we're not gonna release it because of the social damage it could cause if it's misused. i think that's still a concern. i think that we need to look at how technology is applied and, you know, well-meaning tools can be applied in very horrible ways, and they can have very profound impact on that. i think that gpt-3 is a huge technical achievement. and what will gpt-4 be? it will probably be bigger, more expensive to train. really cool architectural tricks. what do you think, is there, i don't know how much thought you've done on distributed computing. is there some technical challenges that are interesting, that you're hopeful about exploring in terms of, you know, a system that, a piece of code that you know, gpt-4, that might have, i don't know, hundreds of trillions of parameters which have to run on thousands of computers. is there some hope that we can make that happen? yeah, well, i mean, today, you can write a check and get access to a thousand tpu cores and do really interesting large-scale training and inference and things that in google cloud, for example, right? and so i don't think it's a question about scale, it's a question about utility. and when i look at the transformer series of architectures that the gpt series is based on, it's really interesting to look at that because they're actually very simple designs. they're not recurrent. the training regimens are pretty simple. and so they don't really reflect human brains, right? but they're really good at learning language models and they're unrolled enough that you can simulate some recurrence, right? and so the question i think about is, where does this take us? like, so we can just keep scaling it, have more parameters, more data, more things, we'll get a better result for sure. but are there architectural techniques that can lead to progress at a faster pace? right, this is when, how do you get, instead of just making it a constant time bigger, how do you get an algorithmic improvement out of this, right? and whether it be a new training regimen, if it becomes sparse networks, for example, human brain is sparse, all these networks are dense. the connectivity patterns can be very different. i think this is where i get very interested and i'm way out of my league on the deep learning side of this, but i think that could lead to big breakthroughs. when you talk about large scale networks, one of the things that jeff dean likes to talk about and he's given a few talks on is this idea of having a sparsely gated mixture of experts kind of a model where you have different nets that are trained and are really good at certain kinds of tasks. and so you have this distributor across a cluster and so you have a lot of different computers that end up being kind of locally specialized in different domains. and then when a query comes in, you gate it and you use learned techniques to route to different parts of the network. and then you utilize the compute resources of the entire cluster by having specialization within it and i don't know where that goes or when it starts to work, but i think things that could be really interesting as well. and then on the data side too, if you can think of data selection as a kind of programming. yeah. i mean, essentially if you look at it, karpathy talked about software 2.0, i mean, in a sense, data is the programming. yeah, yeah. so let me try to summarize andre's position really quick, before i disagree with it. yeah. so andre karpathy is amazing. so this is nothing personal with him. he's an amazing engineer and- and also a good blog post writer. yeah, well, he's a great communicator. he's just an amazing person. he's also really sweet. so his basic premise is that software is suboptimal. i think we can all agree to that. he also points out that deep learning and other learning-based techniques are really great because you can solve problems in more structured ways with less ad hoc code that people write out and don't write test cases for in some cases. and so they don't even know if it works in the first place. and so if you start replacing systems of imperative code with deep learning models, then you get a better result. okay. and i think that he argues that software 2.0 is a pervasively learned set of models. and you get away from writing code. and he's given talks where he talks about, you know, swapping over more and more and more parts of a code to being learned and driven that way. i think that works. and if you're predisposed to liking machine learning, then i think that that's definitely a good thing. i think this is also good for accessibility in many ways because certain people are not gonna write c code or something. and so having a data-driven approach to do this kind of stuff, i think can be very valuable. on the other hand, there are huge trade-offs. and it's not clear to me that software 2.0 is the answer. and probably andre wouldn't argue that it's the answer for every problem either. but i look at machine learning is not a replacement for software 1.0. i look at it as a new programming paradigm. and so programming paradigms, when you look across demands is they have structured programming where you go from go-tos to if-then-else or functional programming from lisp. and you start talking about higher order functions and values and things this. or you talk about object-oriented programming. you're talking about encapsulation, subclassing, and inheritance. you start talking about generic programming where you start talking about code reuse through specialization and different type instantiations. when you start talking about differentiable programming, something that i am very excited about in the context of machine learning, talking about taking functions and generating variance the derivative of another function. that's a programming paradigm that's very useful for solving certain classes of problems. machine learning is amazing at solving certain classes of problems. you're not gonna write a cat detector or even a language translation system by writing c code. that's not a very productive way to do things anymore. and so machine learning is absolutely the right way to do that. in fact, i would say that learned models are really one of the best ways to work with the human world in general. and so anytime you're talking about sensory input of different modalities, anytime that you're talking about generating things in a way that makes sense to a human, i think that learned models are really, really useful. and that's because humans are very difficult to characterize. and so this is a very powerful paradigm for solving classes of problems. but on the other hand, imperative code is too. you're not gonna write a bootloader for your computer with a deep learning model. deep learning models are very hardware intensive. they're very energy intensive because you have a lot of parameters and you can provably implement any function with a learned model this has been shown, but that doesn't make it efficient. and so if you're talking about caring about a few orders of magnitudes worth of energy usage, then it's useful to have other tools in the toolbox. there's also robustness too. i mean, as a- yeah, exactly. all the problems of dealing with data and bias in data, all the problems of software 2.0. and one of the great things that andres is arguing towards, which i completely agree with him, is that when you start implementing things with deep learning, you need to learn from software 1.0 in terms of testing, continuous integration, how you deploy, how do you validate all these things and building systems around that so that you're not just saying , , it seems it's good, ship it, right? well, what happens when i regress something? what happens when i make a classification that's wrong and now i hurt somebody, right? all these things you have to reason about. yeah, but at the same time, the bootloader that works for us humans looks awfully a lot a neural network, right? yeah. it's messy and you can cut out different parts of the brain. there's a lot of this neuroplasticity work that shows that it's gonna adjust. it's a really interesting question, how much of the world's programming could be replaced by software 2.0? like with- oh, well, i mean, it's provably true that you could replace all of it. right, so then it's a question of the trade-offs. so anything that's a function, you can. so it's not a question about if. i think it's a economic question. it's a, what kind of talent can you get? what kind of trade-offs in terms of maintenance, right? those kinds of questions, i think. what kind of data can you collect? i think one of the reasons that i'm most interested in machine learning as a programming paradigm is that one of the things that we've seen across computing in general is that being laser focused on one paradigm often puts you in a box. it's not super great. and so you look at object-oriented programming. like it was all the rage in the early eighties and everything has to be objects and people forgot about functional programming, even though it came first. and then people rediscovered that, hey, if you mix functional and object-oriented and structure, you mix these things together, you can provide very interesting tools that are good at solving different problems. and so the question there is how do you get the best way to solve the problems? it's not about whose tribe should win, right? it's not about, you know, that shouldn't be the question. the question is how do you make it so that people can solve those problems the fastest and they have the right tools in their box to build good libraries and they can solve these problems. and when you look at that, that's , you know, you look at reinforcement learning as one really interesting sub-domain of this. reinforcement learning, often you have to have the integration of a learned model combined with your atari or whatever the other scenario it is that you're working in. you have to combine that thing with the robot control for the arm, right? and so now it's not just about that one paradigm. it's about integrating that with all the other systems that you have, including often legacy systems and things this, right? and so to me, i think that the interesting thing to say is , how do you get the best out of this domain and how do you enable people to achieve things that they otherwise couldn't do without excluding all the good things that we already know how to do? right, but okay, this is a crazy question, but we talked a little bit about gpt-3, but do you think it's possible that these language models that in essence in the language domain, software 2.0 could replace some aspect of compilation, for example, or do program synthesis replace some aspect of programming? yeah, absolutely. so i think that learn models in general are extremely powerful and i think that people underestimate them. maybe you can suggest what i should do. so i have access to the gpt-3 api, would i be able to generate swift code, for example? do you think that could do something interesting and would work? so gpt-3 is probably not trained on the right corpus. so it probably has the ability to generate some swift, i bet it does. it's probably not gonna generate a large enough body of swift to be useful, but taking the next step further, if you had the goal of training something gpt-3 and you wanted to train to generate source code, right? it could definitely do that. now the question is, how do you express the intent of what you want filled in? you can definitely write scaffolding of code and say fill in the hole and sort of put in some for loops, or put in some classes or whatever. and the power of these models is impressive, but there's an unsolved question, at least unsolved to me, which is how do i express the intent of what to fill in? right? and kind of what you'd really want to have, and i don't know that these models are up to the task, is you wanna be able to say, here's the scaffolding and here are the assertions at the end. and the assertions always pass. and so you want a generative model on the one hand, yes. that's fascinating, yeah. right? but you also want some loopback, some reinforcement learning system or something where you're actually saying , i need to hill climb towards something that is more correct. and i don't know that we have that. so it would generate not only a bunch of the code, but the checks that do the testing. it would generate the tests. i think the humans would generate the tests, right? oh, okay. but it would be fascinating if- well, the tests are the requirements. yes, but the, okay. because you have to express to the model what you want to, you don't just want gibberish code. look at how compelling this code looks. you want a story about four horned unicorns or something. well, okay, so exactly. so that's human requirements. but then i thought it's a compelling idea that the gpt-4 model could generate checks that are more high fidelity that check for correctness. because the code it generates, say i ask it to generate a function that gives me the fibonacci sequence. sure. i don't - so decompose the problem, right? so you have two things. you have, you need the ability to generate syntactically correct swift code that's interesting, right? i think gpt series of model architectures can do that. but then you need the ability to add the requirements. so generate fibonacci. the human needs to express that goal. we don't have that language that i know of. no, i mean, it can generate stuff. have you seen with gpt-3 can generate, you can say, i mean, there's interface stuff it can generate html. it can generate basic for loops that give you - right, but pick html. how do i say i want well, no, you could say- or not literally how do i say i want a webpage that's got a shopping cart and this and that? yeah, it does that. i mean, so, okay, so just, i don't know if you've seen these demonstrations, but you type in, i want a red button with the text that says hello. and you type that in natural language and it generates the correct html. i've done this demo. it's kind of compelling. so you have to prompt it with similar kinds of mappings. of course, it's probably handpicked. i got to experiment that probably, but the fact that you can do that once, even out of 20 is quite impressive. again, that's very basic. like the html is kind of messy and bad. but yes, the intent is, the idea is the intent is specified in natural language. okay. yeah, so i've not seen that. that's really cool. yeah. yeah. yeah, but the question is the correctness of that. like visually you can check, , the button is red. but for more complicated functions, where the intent is harder to check, this goes into np completeness kind of things. like i want to know that this code is correct and generates a giant thing that does some kind of calculation. it seems to be working. it's interesting to think , should the system also try to generate checks for itself for correctness? yeah. i don't know. and this is way beyond my experience. the thing that i think about is that there doesn't seem to be a lot of equation or reasoning going on. there's a lot of pattern matching and filling in and kind of propagating patterns that have been seen, before into the future and into the generated result. and so if you want to get correctness, you kind of need to improving kind of things and higher level logic. and i don't know that you could talk to jan about that and see what the bright minds are thinking about right now. but i don't think the gpt is in that vein. it's still really cool. yeah. and surprisingly, who knows, maybe reasoning is- is overrated. yeah. right. i mean, do we reason? yeah. how do you tell? are we just pattern matching based on what we have and then reverse justify it to ourselves? exactly. the reverse. so , i think what the neural networks are missing and i think gpt form might have is to be able to tell stories to itself about what it did. well, that's what humans do. i mean, you talk about network explainability, right? and we give neural nets a hard time about this, but humans don't know why we make decisions. we have this thing called the intuition. and then we try to say, this feels the right thing, but why, right? and you wrestle with that when you're making hard decisions and is that science? not really. let me ask you about a few high level questions, i guess. you've done a million things in your life and been very successful. a bunch of young folks listen to this, ask for advice from successful people you. if you were to give advice to somebody, another graduate student or some high school student about pursuing a career in computing or just advice about life in general, is there some words of wisdom you can give them? so i think you come back to change and profound leaps happen because people are willing to believe that change is possible and that the world does change and are willing to do the hard thing that it takes to make change happen. and whether it be implementing a new programming language or employing a new system or employing a new research paper and designing a new thing, moving the world forward in science and philosophy, whatever, it really comes down to somebody who's willing to put in the work, right? and you have, the work is hard for a whole bunch of different reasons. one of which is, it's work, right? and so you have to have the space in your life in which you can do that work, which is why going to grad school can be a beautiful thing for certain people. but also there's a self doubt that happens. like you're two years into a project, is it going anywhere, right? well, what do you do? do you just give up because it's hard? well, no, i mean, some people suffering and so you plow through it. the secret to me is that you have to love what you're doing and follow that passion because when you get to the hard times, that's when, if you love what you're doing, you're willing to kind of push through. and this is really hard because it's hard to know what you will love doing until you start doing a lot of things. and so that's why i think that particularly early in your career, it's good to experiment. do a little bit of everything. go take the survey class on the first half of every class in your upper division lessons and just get exposure to things because certain things will resonate with you and you'll find out, wow, i'm really good at this. i'm really smart at this. well, it's just because it works with the way your brain. and when something jumps out, i mean, that's one of the things that people often ask about is , well, i think there's a bunch of cool stuff out there. like how do i pick the thing? like how do you hook in your life? how did you just hook yourself in and stuck with it? well, i got lucky, right? i mean, i think that many people forget that a huge amount of it or most of it is luck, right? so let's not forget that. so for me, i fell in love with computers early on because they spoke to me, i guess. what language did they speak? basic. but then it was just kind of following a set of logical progressions, but also deciding that something that was hard was worth doing and a lot of fun, right? and so i think that that is also something that's true for many other domains, which is if you find something that you love doing, that's also hard, if you invest yourself in it and add value to the world, then it will mean something generally, right? and again, that can be a research paper, that can be a software system, that can be a new robot, that can be, there's many things that that can be, but a lot of it is real value comes from doing things that are hard. and that doesn't mean you have to suffer, but it's hard. i mean, you don't often hear that message. we talked about it last time a little bit, but it's one of my, not enough people talk about this. it's beautiful to hear a successful person. well, and self-doubt and imposter syndrome, and these are all things that successful people suffer with as well, particularly when they put themselves in a point of being uncomfortable, which i to do now and then, just because it puts you in learning mode. like if you wanna grow as a person, put yourself in a room with a bunch of people that know way more about whatever you're talking about than you do and ask dumb questions. and guess what? smart people love to teach often, not always, but often. and if you listen, if you're prepared to listen, if you're prepared to grow, if you're prepared to make connections, you can do some really interesting things. and i think that a lot of progress is made by people who kind of hop between domains now and then, because they bring a perspective into a field that nobody else has, if people have only been working in that field themselves. we mentioned that the universe is kind of a compiler, the entirety of it, the whole evolution is kind of a compilation. maybe us human beings are kind of compilers. let me ask the old sort of question that i didn't ask you last time, which is what's the meaning of it all? is there a meaning? like if you asked a compiler why, what would a compiler say? what's the meaning of life? what's the meaning of life? i'm prepared for not to mean anything. here we are all biological things programmed to survive and propagate our dna. and maybe the universe is just a computer and you just go until entropy takes over the world and takes over the universe and then you're done. i don't think that's a very productive way to live your life, if so. and so i prefer to bias towards the other way, which is saying the world has, the universe has a lot of value. and i take happiness out of other people. and a lot of times part of that's having kids, but also the relationships you build with other people. and so the way i try to live my life is , what can i do that has value? how can i move the world forward? how can i take what i'm good at and bring it into the world? and how can i, i'm one of these people that likes to work really hard and be very focused on the things that i do. and so if i'm gonna do that, how can it be in a domain that actually will matter? because a lot of things that we do, we find ourselves in the cycle of , okay, i'm doing a thing, i'm very familiar with it. i've done it for a long time. i've never done anything else, but i'm not really learning. i'm not really, i'm keeping things going, but there's a younger generation that can do the same thing, maybe even better than me. and maybe if i actually step out of this and jump into something i'm less comfortable with, it's scary, but on the other hand, it gives somebody else a new opportunity. it also then puts you back in learning mode and that can be really interesting. and one of the things i've learned is that when you go through that, that first you're deep into imposter syndrome, but when you start working your way out, you start to realize, hey, well, there's actually a method to this. and now i'm able to add new things because i bring different perspective. and this is one of the good things about bringing different kinds of people together. diversity of thought is really important. and if you can pull together people that are coming at things from different directions, you often get innovation. and i love to see that, that aha moment where you're , , we've really cracked this. this is something nobody's ever done before. and then if you can do it in the context where it adds value, other people can build on it, it helps move the world, then that's what really excites me. so that kind of description of the magic of the human experience, do you think we'll ever create that in an agi system? you think we'll be able to create, give ai systems a sense of meaning where they operate in this kind of world exactly in the way you've described, which is they interact with each other, they interact with us humans. sure, well, so i mean, why are you being so a speciesist? right? right, so agi versus bio net, or is it versus bio net? bio net. what are we about machines, right? we're just programmed to run our, we have our objective function that we were optimized for. right? and so we're doing our thing, we think we have purpose, but do we really? yeah. right, i'm not prepared to say that those newfangled agi's have no soul just because we don't understand them. right, and i think that would be when they exist, that would be very premature to look at a new thing through your own lens without fully understanding it. you might be just saying that because ai systems in the future will be listening to this and then. oh yeah, exactly. you don't wanna say anything. please be nice to me, you know, when skynet kills everybody, please spare me. wise look ahead thinking. yeah, but i mean, i think that people spend a lot of time worrying about this kind of stuff, and i think that what we should be worrying about is how do we make the world better? and the thing that i'm most scared about with agi's is not that necessarily the skynet will start shooting everybody with lasers and stuff that to use us for our calories. the thing that i'm worried about is that humanity, i think, needs a challenge. and if we get into a mode of not having a personal challenge, not having a personal contribution, whether that be , you know, your kids and seeing what they grow into and helping guide them, whether it be your community that you're engaged in, you're driving forward, whether it be your work and the things that you're doing and the people you're working with and the products you're building and the contribution there, if people don't have a objective, i'm afraid what that means. and i think that this would lead to a rise of the worst part of people, right? instead of people striving together and trying to make the world better, it could degrade into a very unpleasant world. but i don't know. i mean, we hopefully have a long ways to go before we discover that. unfortunately, we have pretty on the ground problems with the pandemic right now. and so i think we should be focused on that as well. yeah, ultimately, just as you said, you're optimistic. i think it helps for us to be optimistic. that's a fake it until you make it. yeah, well, and why not? what's the other side, right? so i mean, i'm not personally a very religious person, but i've heard people say , yeah, of course i believe in god. of course i go to church because if god's real, i wanna be on the right side of that. and if it's not real, it doesn't matter. yeah, it doesn't matter. and so that's a fair way to do it. yeah, i mean, the same thing with nuclear deterrents, global warming, all these things, all these threats, natural engineer pandemics, all these threats we face. i think it's paralyzing to be terrified of all the possible ways we could destroy ourselves. i think it's much better or least productive to be hopeful and to engineer defenses against these things, to engineer a future where , see a positive future and engineer that future. yeah, well, and i think that's another thing to think about as a human, particularly if you're young and trying to figure out what it is that you wanna be when you grow up i am. i'm always looking for that. the question then is, how do you wanna spend your time? and right now there seems to be a norm of being a consumption culture. like i'm gonna watch the news and revel in how horrible everything is right now. i'm going to go find out about the latest atrocity and find out all the details of the terrible thing that happened and be outraged by it. you can spend a lot of time watching tv and watching the new sitcom or whatever people watch these days, i don't know. but that's a lot of hours, right? and those are hours that if you're turned into being productive, learning, growing, experiencing, when the pandemic's over going, exploring, right? it leads to more growth. and i think it leads to more optimism and happiness because you're building, right? you're building yourself, you're building your capabilities, you're building your viewpoints, you're building your perspective. and i think that a lot of the consuming of other people's messages leads to kind of a negative viewpoint, which you need to be aware of what's happening because that's also important, but there's a balance that i think focusing on creation is a very valuable thing to do. yeah, so what you're saying is people should focus on working on the sexiest field of them all, which is compiler design. exactly. hey, you could go work on machine learning and be crowded out by the thousands of graduates popping out of school that all wanna do the same thing, or you could work in the place that people overpay you because there's not enough smart people working in it. and here at the end of moore's law, according to some people, actually the software is the hard part too. i mean, optimization is truly, truly beautiful. and also on the youtube side or education side, it'd be nice to have some material that shows the beauty of compilers. yeah, yeah. that's something. so that's a call for people to create that kind of content as well. chris, you're one of my favorite people to talk to. it's such a huge honor that you would waste your time talking to me. i've always

      "{'prompt': \"and witnessing from an unbiased place what exactly is happening every day in these shelters. and so just wanted to put that out there and we'll be in communication. thank you. thank you, madam secretary, please put the next item on our screen. council member can each go ahead with your comments on resolution one, four, four, four? thank you. council president pro tem. this is a contract for security services here in our city facilities and i think maybe up to 40 some facilities. so human services, different buildings. and we have had some history with our service contracts in the city recently, as we saw at the airport where the janitorial staff went on strike, we actually had disruptions to the workplace. the disruptions included, you know, a work stoppage, two separate days. and, you know, in spite of the efforts of everyone at the airport to to provide backup disruptions due to labor unrest are bad for our city and they're bad for business. and so one of the first priorities i have when i look at our service contracts is to make sure, are we doing everything we can to avoid economic disruption? are we doing everything we can to live up to our city's values in those contracts? some things are within our control. to set terms for other things have to be determined between the workers and the employers outside the city's control. but the important thing always is that there is a commitment to do those negotiations and those discussions and that we as a city have assurance that there's not going to be disruption. we had a conversation in committee about the securitas security contract a couple of weeks ago, and we received numerous reassurances that there would be good dialog with the workers and with their representatives, and that has just not occurred yet. i'm disappointed to hear that there is a lot of confusion among workers, and this happens when contracts turn over, right? there is a policy now that says you have a right to keep your job, but there are questions among those workers about the terms that they're going to be keeping those jobs under. and the best way to avoid the disruption that can occur with workers maybe getting cold feet, not being sure if they want to stay on, not being sure what's happening is to work in partnership. it is to sit at the table. it is to work together and to make sure that all the communication is as clear as it can be. to make sure that the parties understand what the commitments have been made and that those commitments are going to be kept and that the workers will have a seat at the table . i'm disappointed that those things have not occurred. and so with that, i am asking for this council to, you know, delay this for one week in the hopes that this company will sit down with the workers representatives and assure us in their next appearance before this council that we will not have disruptions because the conversations and the collaboration have not occurred. this is security contracting. it's not janitorial. it's much more complex to find workers to back up and to be in place. we just can't risk another round of disruption in one of our service contracts where it is avoidable. where good conversations and good dialog can clarify communication, clarify intent, and wherever possible, get to as much certainty as possible before this council is asked to vote. so for those reasons, i hope that my colleagues will stay engaged in the week that intervenes here and that they will express their similar support for this dialog to continue. this does not require a vote tonight. this is a special motion that we created when we moved our contracts from two reading bills to one reading bill. and so i think it's an important tool. i don't use it often, but this is an example where i think more partnership and dialog is needed. i understand we're near the end of the year and this is an important contract and we always wish the administration brought these things a little quicker to us so we weren't quite under such a tight timeline. but i think the importance of avoiding disruptions that are foreseeable and preventable is important enough to make sure the parties understand the seriousness of getting to the table and talking. so with that, i think the council president for accepting my motion tonight and invoking of this rule, and i look forward to hearing that some dialog and communication clarifications have been made so that we can feel good that this contract turnover will occur smoothly. thank you. thank you. councilmember hines. i thank you. council president. i want to thank councilmember for her comments. i want the record to know that she is not alone. i agree and i'm sure others do too. thank you. council president. thank you. council resolution 144, four. we'll be back before council for consideration on monday, december 20th. madam secretary, please put the next item on our screen. councilmember hines, go ahead with your comments on resolution 1438.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"webvtt kind captions language en before we go into the details of the cuban missile crisis, it's important to understand the world's environment entering into october of 1962. in 1959, you have a revolution in cuba led by fidel castro. and he is heading the communist party there. cuba is now a communist nation right off of the coast of the united states. this is the middle of the cold war. the u.s. believes in a strategy of containment, does not this. so in 1961, the united states, the cia, the kennedy administration, they try using cuban exiles, people who have left cuba, they try to support them to enter and invade cuba at the bay of pigs. but, the whole effort wasn't planned properly. the support for the cuban exiles, the counter-revolutionaries, those who were trying to oust castro, it was kind of this half-hearted effort. and it was this big failure. so the bay of bigs invasion was a failure in 1961. and it made john f. kennedy seem a little bit weak. it made the cia seem weak. it didn't make anyone on the american side look all that competent, because of that failure. on top of that, we're in the middle of the cold war, remember this. and at the same time, if you go to what the us was doing around the soviet union, it started placing missiles, starting in the late 50's, all the way into 1961 and 1962 --- it started placing medium-ranged ballistic missiles in turkey and in italy. these are where they were allocated. and the significance of that is that now these missiles could reach the major population centers of the soviet union in really a matter of minutes, in 10 to 20 minutes, i think. 16 minutes was how long most of these stayed airborne. and in a situation where both sides have nuclear weapons, there was this kind of notion of well, maybe if you're able to get to the other guy faster, they wouldn't be able to retaliate, and maybe you wouldn't have that mutually assured destruction. so there's this whole idea that you want to get your missiles as close as possible to your enemies so that they could reach the populations centers, the strategic centers of your opponent, as quickly as possible. and if you look up on the web, you can actually find the actual missile sites, and where they were installed, and when they became operational. these are the ones that were in italy, kind of right here, near the heel of italy. so you have this environment, the united states was looking a little bit weak after the bay of pigs invasion. it looks they wanted to oust castro, but they weren't able to do it. they weren't able because they were slightly inept. and at the same time you could imagine that the soviet union did not appreciate the united states placing these missiles so close to its population centers. missiles that could reach its population centers very easily. so now, we fast forward to october of 1962 and the entire cuban missile crisis will occur over 13 or 14 days during october of 1962. so, on the 14th of october we're sending these u2 spy planes over cuba. so this right here is a u2 spy plane. that is a u2 spy plane. and it takes pictures that look this. and on the next day, on october 15th, you have the cia analysts. and they're saying, wow - that looks missiles over there. this looks ballistic missiles that are being set up, that are being set up in cuba. and so all of a sudden, it looks the soviet union is using cuba to do the same thing that we used turkey and italy for, to set up ballistic missiles, really, right off of our coast -- and ballistic missiles that could now now reach any of the strategic population centers, especially on the east coast or the midwest of the united states. so by the 16th-- so this is literally two days after the pictures were taken. the next day, they're analyzing them, and they tell the state department about them. on the 16th, they tell kennedy about them, and kennedy holds a meeting of the executive committee. it wasn't called excomm, just yet. but it was really a subset of special advisors -- a subset of the national security council and other advisors that essentially become the brain trust to figure out what to do about this forming crisis. because of all of a sudden you have a state that we don't off of our borders -- a communist state -- a state aligned with the soviet union. all of a sudden, it has nuclear missiles. it looks these are offensive weapons. these are weapons being designed for a first-strike capability. once again, if they're being launched from cuba, maybe they can attack -- maybe they can obliterate the us before the us even has an opportunity to respond properly. so this really freaks out the kennedy administration. and so they start to think about what can they do about it and early on-- well, there's a couple-- you could just kind of call and talk to the soviets about it and say hey, we don't that. why don't you undo your missiles? but they didn't really think that that would have any significant effect on the soviets. especially, because they probably thought that kennedy was weak at this point. and just to understand who was leading the soviets at this time, it was khrushchev. (this is khrushchev right over here.) and he had even made remarks to the effect that he thought that kennedy was young and may be naive, and maybe too intellectual to really play a good game of chicken here. and so the us kind of felt that it had to look strong here. and so the only real options on the table were maybe blockade cuba - and so a blockade could be an 'all out' blockade, so it would be an economic blockade. but then that's actually considered an act of war because you are, to a large degree, starving a country. another option for the united states, (because it was completely viewed as unacceptable that these missiles should be here, and that they should be deployable from cuba), the other option would be to do air attacks on these missile silos. and then the most extreme action would be to actually invade cuba. and ,obviously that goes in line with, the us' general interest of not having a communist regime so close to its own borders. so, this is what kennedy and his team was wrestling with. and really early on in these early days, most of the team was actually advising kennedy that they should do a full-scale invasion of cuba. they thought that this was the only thing that the soviets would take seriously, it would show that the us is serious about this. and they didn't think that the soviet union would really try to put up a fight in cuba, so far away from their own borders. but kennedy, probably thinking about it pretty reasonably, realized well, hey. they might not do anything in cuba, and they might allow us to oust castro and install a new regime there. but they might retaliate, in fact, they probably would retaliate in europe, but specifically, in berlin, probably in germany as a whole. so, just for the sake of getting these things out of cuba, we could sacrifice a lot in europe. and even more, that any type of conflict between the us and the soviet union could easily escalate to a nuclear war. so these were all on the table. the us goes on high alert. it prepares for any of these situations, because they really don't know what's going to happen. the army, the air force and the navy start mobilizing. so, on, kind of with hours notice, any of those options can, kind of, go into effect. by the 22nd, you have the executive committee -- (and that just becomes formalized as an actual, official group that is advising the president in this capacity.) -- and on the 22nd, kennedy finally puts out his first salvo on what is the us' position on what's going on here. and before this -- just to make things clear -- on the 18th, he did meet, he did meet with the minister of foreign affairs, the soviet minister of foreign affairs, andrei gromyko -- and i'm sure i'm butchering the pronunciations -- and this is where the first time, kennedy is hey, you've got these offensive weapons... and gromyko is insisting that no, they're just defensive weapons. and, to most people, defensive weapons would mean things surface-to-air missiles, things that would stop planes from bombings. but not surface-to-surface missiles, not something that could attack a country. but we'll see, in future letters from khrushchev, that maybe they actually did perceive these missiles as somehow being defensive. but you fast forward. that was on the 18th, it kind of made, it made kennedy and the us frustrated with the russians, because it felt the americans are saying, look, we clearly know you have missiles there, but gromyko is saying no, these are just defensive weapons - nothing to worry about. why are you taking this so seriously? the 19th us goes on high alert. it starts thinking about all of these options. the 22nd this committee is formed formally. but more importantly, kennedy gives a speech to state the united states' opinion. and i'll just read it right here to halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba is being initiated. all ships of any kind bound for cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons, be turned back. this quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. we are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life, as the soviets attempted to do in their berlin blockade of 1948. so, the kennedy administration's position became slightly more nuanced. they said we can't do an all out blockade. 1) that is an act of war; 2) that is, to a large degree, inhumane. why should we starve the cuban people? what we're gonna do is, kind of a filter on the cargo going into cuba. we will only inspect things that we suspect are holding armaments, and we will only turn back the ships that are actually doing it. but then on the 24th, there is a cable from khrushchev, and it say, if you cooly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving away to passions, you will understand that the soviet union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary demands of the united states -- and that the soviet union views the blockade as an act of aggression, and that their ships will be instructed to ignore it. so the game of chicken is beginning to emerge. the united states if just saying look, this is unacceptable. we're gonna stop you from shipping arms to cuba. on the 24th, khrushchev is saying who are you to tell us what to do? and, you know, there's this kind of under current , wait, you've already got stuff set up in italy and turkey, not too far from us. how can you dare... -- (you know, and they call it a blockade, even though the us is calling it a quarantine) -- this is an act of aggression and we will ignore it. so both parties are kind of saying, we don't care what you're gonna do. we're gonna do what whatever we have to do and this whole time, both sides are getting tense, the whole world is kind of taking sides, they're making public statements about what's right or wrong. so, we really are getting very close to the brink of a very major confrontation between the soviet union and the united states. and you know, you can read the book 13 days - robert kennedy, there's also the movie 13 days, which actually is not based on the book. but both of them really kind of give the account of what happened over this period. but then you fast forward to the 25th and kennedy essentially replies, look, these are offensive weapons and these require the responses i have announced. i hope that your government will take necessary action to permit restoration of the earlier situation. ok, so he's saying - look, we have to do this. these are offensive weapons. we cannot tolerate these weapons so close to us borders. and so, also on the 25th, the quarantine is in effect. it does get challenged. the us does start to inspect some ships. they try to inspect one ship that got away a little bit. so the soviets, even though they're speaking the game of chicken, they are turning back. they did turn back 14 ships. and the best guess is that those 14 ships probably did contain some type of armament. so even though, publicly, everyone is playing a very strong game, behind the scenes, there is a little bit of a softening of the stance. and then you fast forward to the 26th, and khrushchev essentially sends his first proposal. and it's interesting here. because, in khrushchev's mind -- (and this is a fascinating letter to read. it's a fairly long letter, so i'm not gonna go into the whole thing and you can get it at this url right over here. it's a fascinating letter. maybe i'll do a whole video where i just read this letter.) he kind of goes into the nuance of what he views as a defensive or an offensive weapon. he implicitly admits that the missiles are there -- that they're not these benign weapons. but, in his letter, he kind of makes the nuance that he'd use them as defensive weapons. he says look, you guys attempted to oust castro already. we view castro as an ally. we think that by placing these weapons here, that you will be less likely to be able to oust castro, because you will be afraid of these weapons. so, khrushchev is kind of setting up-- kruschev is saying, we don't have the intention of using these to attack you for no reason. we're just putting these here to essentially defend one of our allies. so he's saying that's the reason. that's the reason that they placed those weapons there in the first place. he's kind of saying look, you did bay of pigs. you were the ones that took the first shot. now we are defending it. that might have been the rationale. another rationale for why they did it -- and it's just, and probably the more strategic rationale -- is that we already did have these missiles that were pointed at the soviet union in turkey and italy. and the soviet union just wanted to have parity. so, they wanted to put missiles near the us in some ally's country, from the soviet union's point of view. so, on the 26th, khrushchev's first proposa,l that was given through a cable, says if assurances were given by the president and the government of the united states that the usa itself would not participate... - so 'assurances'... (let me underline this in a different color.) -- assurances that the usa itself would not participate in an attack on cuba, and would restrain others from actions of this sort -- probably the cuban exiles -- ... if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything. i am not speaking for fidel castro, but i think that he and the government of cuba evidently would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people to get down to peaceful labor. then, too, the question of-- (and, you know, the communists always talking about labor.) -- then, too, the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no threat, then armaments are a burden for every people. so in this first proposal that came over a cable, he's essentially saying look, if you guys just promise not to attack cuba, if you just make 'assurances' that you will not attack cuba, then we'll essentially undo everything. we'll give in to your wishes. and this stance right here really does make it look their main interest in having those missiles was, kind of, to protect cuba -- so that the us would not try to oust the communists from there. but then on the next day, khrushchev has a public broadcast where he kind of changes his tone a little bit. now he's saying that they would undo the situation in cuba only if the united states removed their missiles from italy and turkey. so, he's sending little mixed messages. his first message was kind of a softer stance look, you guys just promise not to invade cuba and we're gonna pull out of cuba. the second stance is saying no, no. we're only gonna take our missiles out of cuba if you take your missiles out of italy and turkey. and on the same day, another u2 spy plane gets shot down over cuba. this is when both armies are really at, kind of, they're at hair-trigger notice, it's a really scary situation. and this was actually done by-- it was a local decision by a soviet commander. (and khrushchev actually did not want this to happen.) and lucky for, i guess, the world, the us did not use this, alone, as a reason to engage in war. they said maybe it's an accident. if this happens again, then we'll use it as a pretext for war. so it was lucky that this did not trigger an immediate war with the soviets. but the kennedy administration still had the question which of these was a more serious, you know, which of these requests were the soviets really making? this is a more significant request. are they requesting for both? and so it was eventually decided, on the 27th, that hey, let's just pretend we didn't even know -- that the americans didn't even know about the second request that asked for more -- and let's just reply to this first request. so, you essentially have kennedy agreeing with khrushchev, and saying ok, we'll do your first request. we will agree not to invade cuba if you remove your missiles. and then, essentially, what happens--. and that puts khrushchev in a weird situation. (because this is something that he did recommend. but they were ignoring this over here.) but through back channels we said well, we'll offically agree to this. but through back channels the kennedy administration said and we would also be on an understanding, we will also have an understanding on the missiles in italy and turkey. that, look, this isn't part of the deal, but we see what you're saying and we're probably, we're probably going to remove them. and what the soviets also didn't know at that time is that the americans were planning on -- that these missiles, to a large degree, by this point in time, were already obsolete. because we already polaris missiles that were deployable by submarines. and clearly, submarines can deploy things much closer to the action, and they're much harder to track. you can't surveil them and all the rest. so the us kind of agreed to it. but they did it secretly. and the whole point here is that neither side wanted to look they're giving in. neither side wanted to look weak. but on the 28th, there was finally an agreement. and so, publicly, the first khrushchev proposal was agreed to by both khrushchev and the united states. khrushchev agreed to remove -- to not send any more weapons, and also dismantle the weapons that were there, and the americans agreed that they would not invade cuba. so you can imagine the big winner here. the big winner here is probably fidel castro, because the whole time he's paranoid that the us is planning another attack on him. and, at least publicly now, they're saying that they cannot invade him. and if they did, it would they're going back on their word. and privately, the us agreed to remove its missiles from turkey and italy. they didn't wanna do this publicly, because then it would they were being weak. then it would the soviets were able to do this aggressive action. and by doing it, they were able to extract something out of the united states. which is actually the reality. they were able to -- by doing this action, they were able to get these missiles removed from turkey and italy. but the united states wanted to look strong. kennedy has, well -- there's always an approaching election. especially after the bay of pigs, he needed to look a strong leader. and so, to some degree, you have to give khrushchev credit for this. he kind of swallowed his pride and allowed it to publicly look he lost the negotiation. he publicly made it look he got nothing in return for backing down, but in reality he did. he just didn't necessarily get credit for it. but this was a big deal. because this was the closest that the soviet union and the us ever got to really the brink during the cold war.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

      "{'prompt': \"the following is a conversation with thomas sandholm. he's a professor at sameu and co-creator of labratas, which is the first ai system to beat top human players in the game of heads up, no limit, texas hold'em. he has published over 450 papers on game theory and machine learning, including a best paper in 2017 at nips, now renamed to newrips, which is where i caught up with him for this conversation. his research and companies have had wide-reaching impact in the real world, especially because he and his group not only propose new ideas, but also build systems to prove that these ideas work in the real world. this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast. if you enjoy it, subscribe on youtube, itunes, or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman, spelled f-r-i-d. and now, here's my conversation with thomas sandholm. can you describe at the high level the game of poker, heads up, texas hold'em, for people who might not be familiar with this card game? yeah, happy to. so heads up, no limit, texas hold'em has really emerged in the ai community as a main benchmark for testing these application independent algorithms for imperfect information game solving. and this is a game that's actually played by humans. you don't see that much on tv or casinos because, well, for various reasons, but you do see it in some expert level casinos and you see it in the best poker movies of all time. it's actually an event in the world series of poker, but mostly it's played online and typically for pretty big sums of money. and this is a game that usually only experts play. so if you go to your home game on a friday night, it probably is not going to be heads up, no limit, texas hold'em. it might be no limit, texas hold'em in some cases, but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive. while heads up means it's two players. so it's really me against you. am i better or are you better? much chess or go in that sense, but an imperfect information game, which makes it much harder because i have to deal with issues of you knowing things that i don't know and i know things that you don't know instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board for both of us to see. so in texas hold'em, there's two cards that you only see that belong to you. yeah. and there is, they gradually lay out some cards that add up overall to five cards that everybody can see. yeah. so the imperfect nature of the information is the two cards that you're holding up front. yeah. so as you said, you first get two cards in private each and then there's a betting round. then you get three cards in public on the table. then there's a betting round. then you get the fourth card in public on the table. there's a betting round. then you get the fifth card on the table. there's a betting round. so there's a total of four betting rounds and four tranches of information revelation, if you will. only the first tranche is private and then it's public from there. and this is probably by far the most popular game in ai and just the general public in terms of imperfect information. so it's probably the most popular spectator game to watch, right? so which is why it's a super exciting game to tackle. so it's on the order of chess, i would say, in terms of popularity, in terms of ai setting it as the bar of what is intelligence. so in 2017, lebrados, how do you pronounce it? lebrados. lebrados. lebrados beats... a little latin there. a little bit of latin. lebrados beat a few, four expert human players. can you describe that event? what you learned from it? what was it ? what was the process in general for people who have not read the papers and studied? yeah. so the event was that we invited four of the top 10 players, who are specialist players in heads up no limit texas hold'em, which is very important because this game is actually quite different than the multiplayer version. we brought them in to pittsburgh to play at the reverse casino for 20 days. we wanted to get 120,000 hands in because we wanted to get statistical significance. so it's a lot of hands for humans to play, even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally. so we couldn't just have one of them play so many hands. 20 days they were playing basically morning to evening. and i raised 200,000 as a little incentive for them to play. and the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000. we actually paid them out based on how they did against ai each. so they had an incentive to play as hard as they could, whether they're way ahead or way behind or right at the mark of beating the ai. and you don't make any money, unfortunately. right. no, we can't make any money. so originally, a couple of years earlier, i actually explored whether we could actually play for money because that would be, of course, interesting as well to play against the top people for money. but the pennsylvania gaming board said no. so we couldn't. so this is much an exhibit, for a musician or a boxer or something that. nevertheless, you were keeping track of the money and brought us one close to $2 million i think. so if it was for real money, if you were able to earn money, that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievement. just a few details. what were the players looking at? were they behind a computer? what was the interface ? yes, they were playing much they normally do. these top players, when they play this game, they play mostly online. so they're used to playing through a ui. and they did the same thing here. so there was this layout. you could imagine there's a table on the screen. there's the human sitting there. and then there's the ai sitting there. and the screen shows everything that's happening. the cards coming out and shows the bets being made. and we also had the betting history for the human. so if the human forgot what had happened in the hand so far, they could actually reference back and so forth. is there a reason they were given access to the betting history for? well, it didn't really matter. they wouldn't have forgotten anyway. these are top quality people. but we just wanted to put out there so it's not a question of the human forgetting and the ai somehow trying to get advantage of better memory. so what was that ? i mean, that was an incredible accomplishment. so what did it feel before the event? did you have doubt, hope? or where was your confidence at? yeah, that's great. great question. so 18 months earlier, i had organized a similar brains versus ai competition with our previous ai called cloudico. and we couldn't beat the humans. so this time around, it was only 18 months later. and i knew that this new ai, libratus, was way stronger. but it's hard to say how you'll do against the top humans before you try. so i thought we had about a 50-50 shot. and the international betting sites put us as a four to one or five to one underdog. so it's kind of interesting that people really believe in people and over ai. people don't just over believe in themselves, but they have overconfidence in other people as well compared to the performance of ai. and yeah, so we were a four to one or five to one underdog. and even after three days of beating the humans in a row, we were still 50-50 on the international betting sites. do you think there's something special and magical about poker and the way people think about it? in a sense, you have, i mean, even in chess, there's no hollywood movies. poker is the star of many movies. and there's this feeling that certain human facial expressions and body language, eye movement, all these tells are critical to poker. like you can look into somebody's soul and understand their betting strategy and so on. so that's probably why, possibly, do you think that is why people have a confidence that humans will outperform, because ai systems cannot, in this construct, perceive these kinds of tells. they're only looking at betting patterns and nothing else, the betting patterns and statistics. so what's more important to you if you step back on human players, human versus human, what's the role of these tells, of these ideas that we romanticize? yeah. so i'll split it into two parts. so one is why do humans trust humans more than ai and have overconfidence in humans? i think that's not really related to the tell question. it's just that they've seen these top players, how good they are, and they're really fantastic. so it's just hard to believe that an ai could beat them. so i think that's where that comes from. and that's actually maybe a more general lesson about ai, that until you've seen it overperform a human, it's hard to believe that it could. but then the tells, a lot of these top players, they're so good at hiding tells that among the top players, it's actually not really worth it for them to invest a lot of effort trying to find tells in each other, because they're so good at hiding them. so yes, at the kind of friday evening game, tells are going to be a huge thing. you can read other people and if you're a good reader, you'll read them an open book. but at the top levels of poker now, the tells become a much smaller and smaller aspect of the game as you go to the top levels. the amount of strategies, the amounts of possible actions is very large, 10 to the power of 100 plus. so there has to be some, i've read a few of the papers related, it has to form some abstractions of various hands and actions. so what kind of abstractions are effective for the game of poker? yeah, so you're exactly right. so when you go from a game tree, that's 10 to the 161, especially in an imperfect information game, it's way too large to solve directly, even with our fastest equilibrium finding algorithms. so you want to abstract it first. and abstraction in games is much trickier than abstraction in mdps or other single agent settings, because you have these abstraction pathologies that if i have a finer grained abstraction, the strategy that i can get from that for the real game might actually be worse than the strategy i can get from the coarse grained abstraction. so you have to be very careful. now the kinds of abstractions just to zoom out, we're talking about there's the hands abstractions and then there's betting strategies. yeah, betting actions. yeah, so there's information abstraction, talk about general games, information abstraction, which is the abstraction of what chance does. and this would be the cards in the case of poker. and then there's action abstraction, which is abstracting the actions of the actual players, which would be bets in the case of poker. yourself and the other players? yes, yourself and other players. and for information abstraction, we were completely automated. so these were, these are algorithms, but they do what we call potential aware abstraction, where we don't just look at the value of the hand, but also how it might materialize in the good or bad hands over time. and it's a certain kind of bottom up process with integer programming there and clustering and various aspects, how do you build this abstraction? and then in the action abstraction there, it's largely based on how humans and other ai's have played this game in the past. but in the beginning, we actually use an automated action abstraction technology, which is provably convergent and that it finds the optimal combination of bet sizes, but it's not very scalable. so we couldn't use it for the whole game, but we used it for the first couple of betting actions. so what's more important, the strength of the hand, so the information abstraction or the how you play them, the actions, does it, you know, the romanticized notion again is that it doesn't matter what hands you have, that the actions, the betting may be the way you win no matter what hands you have. yeah. so that's why you have to play a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller. so you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands and then you're going to win the match. even with thousands of hands, you can get lucky because there's so much variance in no limit texas hold'em because if we both go all in, it's a huge stack of variance. so there are these massive swings in no limit texas hold'em. so that's why you have to play not just thousands, but over a hundred thousand hands to get statistical significance. so let me ask another way this question. if you didn't even look at your hands, but they didn't know that, your opponents didn't know that, how well would you be able to do? that's a good question. there's actually, i heard this story that there's this norwegian female poker player called annette oberstad who's actually won a tournament by doing exactly that, but that would be extremely rare. so you cannot really play well that way. so the hands do have some role to play. yes. so lebradis does not use, as far as i understand, use learning methods, deep learning. is there room for learning? there's no reason why lebradis doesn't combine with an alphago type approach for estimating the quality for a function estimator. what are your thoughts on this, maybe as compared to another algorithm, which i'm not that familiar with, deepstack, the engine that does use deep learning that is unclear how well it does, but nevertheless uses deep learning. so what are your thoughts about learning methods to aid in the way that lebradis plays? in the way that lebradis plays the game of poker. yeah. so as you said, lebradis did not use learning methods and played very well without them. since then we have actually, actually here, we have a couple of papers on things that do use learning techniques and deep learning in particular. and sort of the way you're talking about where it's learning an evaluation function. but in imperfect information games, unlike, let's say in go, or now also in chess and shogi, it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but it also depends on both players' beliefs. like if i have a bad hand, i'm much better off if the opponent thinks i have a good hand and vice versa. if i have a good hand, i'm much better off if the opponent believes i have a bad hand. so the value of a state is not just a function of the cards. it depends on, if you will, the path of play, but only to the extent that is captured in the belief distributions. so that's why it's not as simple as it is in perfect information games. and i don't want to say it's simple there either. it's of course very complicated computationally there too, but at least conceptually it's very straightforward. there's a state, there's an evaluation function. you can try to learn it. here you have to do something more. and what we do is in one of these papers, we're looking at allowing, where we allow the opponent to actually take different strategies at the leaf of the search tree, if you will. and that is a different way of doing it. and it doesn't assume there for a particular way that the opponent plays, but it allows the opponent to choose from a set of different continuation strategies. and that forces us to not be too optimistic in our lookahead search. and that's one way you can do sound lookahead search in imperfect information games, which is very difficult. and you were asking about deepstack. what they did, it was very different than what we do, either in libratus or in this new work. they were randomly generating various situations in the game. then they were doing the lookahead from there to the end of the game, as if that was the start of a different game. and then they were using deep learning to learn those values of those states. but the states were not just the physical states. they include the belief distributions. when you talk about lookahead for deepstack or with libratus, does it mean considering every possibility that the game can evolve? are we talking about extremely sort of this exponentially growth of a tree? yes. so we're talking about exactly that. much you do in alpha beta search or monte carlo tree search, but with different techniques. so there's a different search algorithm. and then we have to deal with the leaves differently. so if you think about what libratus did, we didn't have to worry about this because we only did it at the end of the game. so we would always terminate into a real situation and we would know what the payout is. it didn't do these depth limited lookaheads. but now in this new paper, which is called depth limited, i think it's called depth limited search for imperfect information games, we can actually do sound depth limited lookaheads. so we can actually start to do the lookahead from the beginning of the game on because that's too complicated to do for this whole long game. so in libratus, we were just doing it for the end. so, and then the other side, this belief distribution. so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs that the opponent might have? yeah, yeah, it is explicitly modeled, but it's not assumed. the beliefs are actually output, not input. of course, the starting beliefs are input, but they just fall from the rules of the game because we know that the dealer deals uniformly from the deck. so i know that every pair of cards that you might have is equally likely. i know that for a fact, that just follows from the rules of the game. of course, except the two cards that i have, i know you don't have those. you have to take that into account. that's called card removal and that's very important. is the dealing always coming from a single deck in heads up? so you can assume... single deck. so you know that if i have the ace of spades, i know you don't have an ace of spades. great. so in the beginning, your belief is basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands, but how do you start to adjust that belief? well, that's where this beauty of game theory comes. so nash equilibrium, which john nash introduced in 1950, introduces what rational play is when you have more than one player. and these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans, one for each player. so that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy, given that the other doesn't deviate. but as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base rule. so nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games. nash equilibrium doesn't just define strategies. it also defines beliefs for both of us and defines beliefs for each state. so at each state, each, if they're called information sets, at each information set in the game, there's a set of different states that we might be in, but i don't know which one we're in. nash equilibrium tells me exactly what is the probability distribution over those real world states in my mind. how does nash equilibrium give you that distribution? so why... i'll do a simple example. so you know the game rock, paper, scissors. so we can draw it as player one moves first and then player two moves. but of course, it's important that player two doesn't know what player one moved. otherwise player two would win every time. so we can draw that as an information set where player one makes one of three moves first. and then there's an information set for player two. so player two doesn't know which of those nodes the world is in. but once we know the strategy for player one, nash equilibrium will say that you play one third rock, one third paper, one third scissors. from that, i can derive my beliefs on the information set that they're one third, one third, one third. so bayes gives you that. bayes gives you. but is that specific to a particular player or is it something you quickly update with the specific player? no, the game theory isn't really player specific. so that's also why we don't need any data. we don't need any history how these particular humans played in the past or how any ai or even had played before. it's all about rationality. so the ai just thinks about what would a rational opponent do? and what would i do if i am rational? and that's the idea. i am rational. and that's the idea of game theory. so it's really a data-free, opponent-free approach. so it comes from the design of the game as opposed to the design of the player. exactly. there's no opponent modeling per se. i mean, we've done some work on combining opponent modeling with game theory so you can exploit weak players even more. but that's another strand. and in lee brothers, we didn't turn that on because i decided that these players are too good. and when you start to exploit an opponent, you typically open yourself up to exploitation. and these guys have so few holes to exploit and they're world's leading experts in counter-exploitation. so i decided that we're not going to turn that stuff on. actually, i saw a few papers exploiting opponents. it sounded very interesting to explore. do you think there's room for exploitation generally outside of lebron? is there subject or people differences that could be exploited, maybe not just in poker, but in general interactions and negotiations, all these other domains that you're considering? yeah, definitely. we've done some work on that. and i really the work that hybridizes the two. so you figure out what would a rational opponent do. and by the way, that's safe in these zero-sum games, two-player zero-sum games, because if the opponent does something irrational, yes, it might throw off my beliefs. but the amount that the player can gain by throwing off my belief is always less than they lose by playing poorly. so it's safe. but still, if somebody's weak as a player, you might want to play differently to exploit them more. so you can think about it this way. a game theoretic strategy is unbeatable, but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent. so the winnings per hand might be better with a different strategy. and the hybrid is that you start from a game theoretic approach. and then as you gain data about the opponent in certain parts of the game tree, then in those parts of the game tree, you start to tweak your strategy more and more towards exploitation, while still staying fairly close to the game theoretic strategy so as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much. hoffman how do you do that? do you try to vary up strategies, make it unpredictable? it's , what is it, tit for tat strategies in prisoner's dilemma or? bastien well, it hasn't that that's a repeated game kind of repeated games, prisoner's dilemma, repeated games. but even there, there's no proof that says that that's the best thing. but experimentally, it actually does does well. hoffman so what kind of games are there, first of all, i don't know if this is something that you could just summarize. there's perfect information games, or all the information is on the table. there is imperfect information games. there's repeated games that you play over and over. there's zero sum games. there's non zero sum games. and then there's a really important distinction you're making two player versus more players. so what are what other games are there? and what's the difference, for example, with this two player game versus more players? what are the key differences? bastien right. so let me start from the the basics. so a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and over. in these extensive form games, where we think about tree form, maybe with these information sets to represent incomplete information, you can have kind of repetitive interactions. even repeated games are a special case of that, by the way. but the game doesn't have to be exactly the same. it's in sourcing options. yes, we're going to see the same supply base year to year. but what i'm buying is a little different every time and the supply base is a little different every time and so on. so it's not really repeated. so to find a purely repeated game is actually very rare in the world. so they're really a very coarse model of what's going on. then if you move up from just repeated simple repeated matrix games, not all the way to extensive form games, but in between the stochastic games, where you think about it these little matrix games. and when you take an action and your home takes an action, they determine not which next game i'm going to, but the distribution of our next games where i might be going to. so that's the stochastic game. but it's matrix games repeated, stochastic games, extensive form games. that is from less to more general. and poker is an example of the last one. so it's really in the most general setting, extensive form games. and that's kind of what the ai community has been working on and been benchmarked on with this heads up no limit texas hold. can you describe extensive form games? what's the model here? yeah. so if you're familiar with the tree form, so it's really the tree form, in chess, there's a search tree versus a matrix. yeah. and the matrix is called the matrix form or by matrix form or normal form game. and here you have the tree form. so you can actually do certain types of reasoning there that you lose the information when you go to normal form. there's a certain form of equivalence. like if you go from tree form and you say it, every possible contingency plan is a strategy. then i can actually go back to the normal form, but i lose some information from the lack of sequentiality. then the multiplayer versus two player distinction is an important one. so two player games in zero sum are conceptually easier and computationally easier. they're still huge this one, but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier in that conceptually you don't have to worry about which equilibrium is the other guy going to play when there are multiple, because any equilibrium strategy is a best response to any other equilibrium strategy. so i can play a different equilibrium from you and we'll still get the right values of the game. that falls apart even with two players, when you have a general sum games. even without cooperation, just even without cooperation. so there's a big gap from two players zero sum to two player general sum or even to three players zero sum. that's a big gap, at least in theory. can you maybe non-mathematically provide the intuition why it all falls apart with three or more players? it seems you should still be able to have a nash equilibrium that's instructive, that holds. okay. so it is true that all finite games have a nash equilibrium. so this is what your nash actually proved. so they do have a nash equilibrium. that's not the problem. the problem is that there can be many. and then there's a question of which equilibrium to select. so, and if you select your strategy from a different equilibrium and i select mine, then what does that mean? and in these non-zero sum games, we may lose some joint benefit by being just simply stupid. we could actually both be better off if we did something else. and in three player, you get other problems also collusion. like maybe you and i can gang up on a third player and we can do radically better by colluding. so there are lots of issues that come up there. so no brown, the student you work with on this, has mentioned, i looked through the ama on reddit. he mentioned that the ability of poker players to collaborate would make the game. he was asked the question of how would you make the game of poker, or both of you were asked the question, how would you make the game of poker beyond being solvable by current ai methods? and he said that there's not many ways of making poker more difficult, but collaboration or cooperation between players would make it extremely difficult. so can you provide the intuition behind why that is, if you agree with that idea? yeah, so i've done a lot of work on coalitional games and we actually have a paper here with my other student, gabriele farina, and some other collaborators at nips on that. actually just came back from the poster session where we presented this. but so when you have a collusion, it's a different problem. and it typically gets even harder then. even the game representations, some of the game representations don't really allow good computation. so we actually introduced a new game representation for that. is that kind of cooperation part of the model? do you have information about the fact that other players are cooperating, or is it just this chaos where nothing is known? so there's some things unknown. can you give an example of a collusion type game? so bridge. so think about bridge. it's when you and i are on a team, our payoffs are the same. the problem is that we can't talk. so when i get my cards, i can't whisper to you what my cards are. that would not be allowed. so we have to somehow coordinate our strategies ahead of time, and only ahead of time. and then there's certain signals we can talk about, but they have to be such that the other team also understands them. so that's an example where the coordination is already built into the rules of the game. but in many other situations auctions or negotiations or diplomatic relationships, poker, it's not really built in, but it still can be very helpful for the colluders. i've read you write somewhere, the negotiations, you come to the table with prior, a strategy that you're willing to do and not willing to do those kinds of things. so how do you start to now moving away from poker, moving beyond poker into other applications, negotiations? how do you start applying this to other domains, even real world domains that you've worked on? yeah, i actually have two startup companies doing exactly that. one is called strategic machine, and that's for kind of business applications, gaming, sports, all sorts of things that. any applications of this to business and to sports and to gaming, to various types of things in finance, electricity markets and so on. and the other is called strategy robot, where we are taking this to military security, cybersecurity and intelligence applications. i think you worked a little bit in, how do you put it, advertisement, sort of suggesting ads kind of thing. yeah, that's another company, optimized markets, but that's much more about a combinatorial market and optimization based technology. that's not using these game theory reasoning technologies. i see. okay, so what sort of high level do you think about our ability to use game theoretic concepts to model human behavior? do you think human behavior is amenable to this kind of modeling outside of the poker games? and where have you seen it done successfully in your work? i'm not sure. the goal really is modeling humans. like for example, if i'm playing a zero-sum game, i don't really care that the opponent is actually following my model of rational behavior, because if they're not, that's even better for me. right. so see with the opponents in games, there's the prerequisite is that you formalize the interaction in some way that can be amenable to analysis. i mean, you've done this amazing work with mechanism design, designing games that have certain outcomes. but so i'll tell you an example from my world of autonomous vehicles, right? we're studying pedestrians and pedestrians and cars negotiate in this nonverbal communication. there's this weird game dance of tension where pedestrians are basically saying, i trust that you won't kill me. and so as a jaywalker, i will step onto the road, even though i'm breaking the law and there's this tension. and the question is, we really don't know how to model that well in trying to model intent. and so people sometimes bring up ideas of game theory and so on. do you think that aspect of human behavior can use these kinds of imperfect information approaches, modeling? how do you start to attack a problem that when you don't even know how to design the game to describe the situation in order to solve it? okay. so i haven't really thought about jaywalking, but one thing that i think could be a good application in autonomous vehicles is the following. so let's say that you have fleets of autonomous cars operated by different companies. so maybe here's the waymo fleet and here's the uber fleet. if you think about the rules of the road, they define certain legal rules, but that still leaves a huge strategy space open. like as a simple example, when cars merge, how humans merge, they slow down and look at each other and try to merge. wouldn't it be better if these situations would already be pre-negotiated so we can actually merge at full speed and we know that this is the situation, this is how we do it, and it's all going to be faster. but there are way too many situations to negotiate manually. so you could use automated negotiation. this is the idea at least. you could use automated negotiation to negotiate all of these situations or many of them in advance. and of course it might be that, hey, maybe you're not going to always let me go first. maybe you said, okay, well, in these situations, i'll let you go first, but in exchange, you're going to give me too much, you're going to let me go first in these situations. so it's this huge combinatorial negotiation. and do you think there's room in that example of merging to model this whole situation as an imperfect information game or do you really want to consider it to be a perfect? no, that's a good question. yeah. that's a good question. do you pay the price of assuming that you don't know everything? yeah, i don't know. it's certainly much easier. games with perfect information are much easier. so if you can get away with it, you should. but if the real situation is of imperfect information, then you're going to have to deal with imperfect information. great. so what lessons have you learned the annual computer poker competition? an incredible accomplishment of ai. you look at the history of deep blue, alphago, these kind of moments when ai stepped up in an engineering effort and a scientific effort combined to beat the best of human players. so what do you take away from this whole experience? what have you learned about designing ai systems that play these kinds of games? and what does that mean for sort of ai in general for the future of ai development? yeah. so that's a good question. so there's so much to say about it. i do this type of performance oriented research, although in my group, we go all the way from idea to theory to experiments to big system building to commercialization. so we span that spectrum. but i think that in a lot of situations in ai, you really have to build the big systems and evaluate them at scale before you know what works and doesn't. and we've seen that in the computational game theory community, that there are a lot of techniques that look good in the small, but then they cease to look good in the large. and we've also seen that there are a lot of techniques that look superior in theory. and i really mean in terms of convergence rates, better, first order methods, better convergence rates, the cfr based algorithms. yet the cfr based algorithms are the fastest in practice. so it really tells me that you have to test this in reality. the theory isn't tight enough, if you will, to tell you which algorithms are better than the others. and you have to look at these things in the large, because any sort of projections you do from the small can at least in this domain be very misleading. so that's kind of from a kind of a science and engineering perspective, from a personal perspective, it's been just a wild experience in that with the first poker competition, the first brains versus ai man machine poker competition that we organized. there had been, by the way, for other poker games, there had been previous competitions, but this was for heads up, no limit. this was the first. and i probably became the most hated person in the world of poker. and i didn't mean to... why is that? for cracking the game for something? yeah. a lot of people felt that it was a real threat to the whole game, the whole existence of the game. if ai becomes better than humans, people would be scared to play poker because there are these superhuman ais running around taking their money and all of that. so it was really aggressive. the comments were super aggressive. i got everything just short of death threats. do you think the same was true for chess? because right now they just completed the world championships in chess and humans just started ignoring the fact that there's ai systems now that outperform humans and they still enjoy the game, it's still a beautiful game. yes, that's what i think. and i think the same thing happens in poker. and so i didn't think of myself as somebody who was going to kill the game and i don't think i did. i've really learned to love this game. i wasn't a poker player before, but i learned so many nuances from these ais. and they've really changed how the game is played, by the way. so they have these very martian ways of playing poker and the top humans are now incorporating those types of strategies into their own play. so if anything, to me, our work has made poker a richer, more interesting game for humans to play, not something that is going to steer humans away from it entirely. just a quick comment on something you said, which is, if i may say so, in academia is a little bit rare sometimes. it's pretty brave to put your ideas to the test in the way you described, saying that sometimes good ideas don't work when you actually try to apply them at scale. so where does that come from? i mean, if you could do advice for people, what drives you in that sense? were you always this way? i mean, it takes a brave person, i guess is what i'm saying, to test their ideas and to see if this thing actually works against human top human players and so on. i don't know about brave, but it takes a lot of work. it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to make something big and to organize an event and stuff that. and what drives you in that effort? because you could still, i would argue, get a best paper award at nips as you did in 17 without doing this. that's right. yes. and so in general, i believe it's very important to do things in the real world and at scale. and that's really where the pudding, if you will, proof is in the pudding. that's where it is. in this particular case, it was kind of a competition between different groups for many years as to who can be the first one to beat the top humans at heads up, no limit, texas hold'em. so it became kind of a competition, who can get there? yeah. so a little friendly competition can be a can do wonders for progress. yes, absolutely. so the topic of mechanism design, which is really interesting, also kind of new to me, except as an observer of, i don't know, politics and any, i'm an observer of mechanisms, but you write in your paper and automated mechanism design that i quickly read. so mechanism design is designing the rules of the game. so you get a certain desirable outcome and you have this work on doing so in an automatic fashion as opposed to fine tuning it. so what have you learned from those efforts? if you look, say, i don't know, at a complex our political system, can we design our political system to have in an automated fashion to have outcomes that we want? can we design something traffic lights to be smart where it gets outcomes that we want? so what are the lessons that you draw from that work? yeah. so i still very much believe in the automated mechanism design direction. yes. but it's not a panacea. there are impossibility results in mechanism design, saying that there is no mechanism that accomplishes objective x in class c. so there's no way using any mechanism design tools, manual or automated, to do certain things in mechanism design. can you describe that again? so meaning it's impossible to achieve that? yeah. ends or it's unlikely? impossible. so these are not statements about human ingenuity, who might come up with something smart. these are proofs that if you want to accomplish properties x in class c, that is not doable with any mechanism. the good thing about automated mechanism design is that we're not really designing for a class. we're designing for specific settings at a time. so even if there's an impossibility result for the whole class, it just doesn't mean that all of the cases in the class are impossible. it just means that some of the cases are impossible. so we can actually carve these islands of possibility within these non-impossible classes. and we've actually done that. so one of the famous results in mechanism design is the meyerson-satette-wayte theorem by roger meyerson and mark satette-wayte from 1983. it's an impossibility of efficient trade under imperfect information. we show that you can in many settings avoid that and get efficient trade anyway. depending on how you design the game. okay. so depending how you design the game. and of course, it doesn't in any way contradict the impossibility result. the impossibility results is still there, but it just finds spots within this impossible class where in those spots you don't have the impossibility. great. sorry if i'm going a bit philosophical, but what lessons do you draw towards, i mentioned, politics or human interaction and designing mechanisms for outside of just these kinds of trading or auctioning or purely formal games or human interaction, a political system? what, how can you think it's applicable to politics or to business, to negotiations, these kinds of things, designing rules that have certain outcomes? yeah. yeah, i do think so. have you seen success that successfully done? they hasn't really, , you mean mechanism design or automated mechanism design? so mechanism design itself has had fairly limited success so far. there are certain cases, but most of the real world situations are actually not sound from a mechanism design perspective. even in those cases where they've been designed by very knowledgeable mechanism design people, the people are typically just taking some insights from the theory and applying those insights into the real world rather than applying the mechanisms directly. so one famous example of is the fcc spectrum auctions. so i've also had a small role in that and very good economists have been, excellent economists have been working on that with no game theory. yet the rules that are designed in practice there, they're such that bidding truthfully is not the best strategy. usually mechanism design, we try to make things easy for the participants. so telling the truth is the best strategy, but even in those very high stakes auctions where you have tens of billions of dollars worth of spectrum auctioned, truth telling is not the best strategy. and by the way, nobody knows even a single optimal bidding strategy for those auctions. what's the challenge of coming up with an optimal bid? because there's a lot of players and there's imperfect information. it's not so much a lot of players, but many items for sale. and these mechanisms are such that even with just two items or one item bidding truthfully wouldn't be the best strategy. if you look at the history of ai, it's marked by seminal events, alphago beating a world champion, humango player. i would put lebrados winning the heads up no limit, holdem is one of such event. and what do you think is the next such event, whether it's in your life or in the broadly ai community that you think might be out there that would surprise the world? so that's a great question. and i don't really know the answer in terms of game solving. the heads up no limit texas holden really was the one remaining widely agreed upon benchmark. so that was the big milestone. now, are there other things? yeah, certainly there are, but there is not one that the community has kind of focused on. so what could be other things? there are groups working on starcraft. there are groups working on dota 2. these are video games. yes. or you could have diplomacy or hanabi, you know, things that. these are recreational games, but none of them are really acknowledged as kind of the main next challenge problem chess or go or heads up no limit texas holden was. so i don't really know in the game solving space what is or what will be the next benchmark. i kind of hope that there will be a next benchmark because really the different groups working on the same problem really drove these application independent techniques forward very quickly over 10 years. do you think there's an open problem that excites you that you start moving away from games into real world games, say the stock market trading? yeah, so that's kind of how i am. so i am probably not going to work as hard on these recreational benchmarks. i'm doing two startups on game solving technology, strategic machine and strategy robot. and we're really interested in pushing this stuff into practice. what do you think would be really, you know, a powerful result that would be surprising? that would be, if you can say, i mean, you know, five years, 10 years from now, something that statistically you would say is not very likely, but if there's a breakthrough, what achieve? yeah, so i think that overall, we're in a very different situation in game theory than we are in, let's say, machine learning. yes. so in machine learning, it's a fairly mature technology, and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the real world. in game solving, there are almost no applications yet. we have just become superhuman, which machine learning, you could argue happened in the 90s, if not earlier, and at least on supervised learning, certain complex supervised learning applications. now, i think the next challenge problem, i know you're not asking about it this way, you're asking about the technology breakthrough, but i think the big, big breakthrough is to be able to show that, hey, maybe most of, let's say, military planning or most of business strategy will actually be done strategically using computational game theory. that's what i would to see as the next five or 10-year goal. maybe you can explain to me again, forgive me if this is an obvious question, but, you know, machine learning methods, neural networks suffer from not being transparent, not being explainable. game theoretic methods, you know, nash equilibria, do they generally, when you see the different solutions, are they, when you talk about military operations, are they, once you see the strategies, do they make sense? are they explainable or do they suffer from the same problems as neural networks do? so that's a good question. i would say a little bit yes and no. and what i mean by that is that these game theoretic strategies, let's say, nash equilibrium, it has provable properties. so it's unlike, let's say, deep learning where you kind of cross your fingers, hopefully it'll work. and then after the fact, when you have the weights, you're still crossing your fingers and i hope it will work. here, you know that the solution quality is there, this provable solution quality guarantees. now, that doesn't necessarily mean that the strategies are human understandable. that's a whole other problem. so i think that deep learning and computational game theory are in the same boat in that sense, that both are difficult to understand. but at least the game theoretic techniques, they have these guarantees of solution quality. so do you see business operations, strategic operations, even military in the future being at least the strong candidates being proposed by automated systems? do you see that? yeah, i do. i do. but that's more of a belief than a substantiated fact. depending on where you land in optimism or pessimism, that's a really, to me, that's an exciting future, especially if there's provable things in terms of optimality. so looking into the future, there's a few folks worried about the, especially you look at the game of poker, which is probably one of the last benchmarks in terms of games being solved. they worry about the future and the existential threats of artificial intelligence. so the negative impact in whatever form on society. is that something that concerns you as much or are you more optimistic about the positive impacts of ai? oh, i am much more optimistic about the positive impacts. so just in my own work, what we've done so far, we run the nationwide kidney exchange. hundreds of people are walking around alive today who wouldn't be. and it's increased employment. you have a lot of people now running kidney exchanges and at transplant centers interacting with the kidney exchange. you have extra surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, hospitals, all of that. so employment is increasing from that and the world is becoming a better place. another example is combinatorial sourcing auctions. we did 800 large scale combinatorial sourcing auctions from 2001 to 2010 in a previous startup of mine called combinenet. and we increased the supply chain efficiency on that $60 billion of spend by 12.6. so that's over $6 billion of efficiency improvement in the world. and this is not shifting value from somebody to somebody else, just efficiency improvement. like in trucking, less empty driving, so there's less waste, less carbon footprint and so on. so a huge positive impact in the near term, but sort of to stay in it for a little longer because i think game theory has a role to play here. let me actually come back on that as one thing. i think ai is also going to make the world much safer. so that's another aspect that often gets overlooked. well, let me ask this question. maybe you can speak to the safer. so i talked to max tegmark and stuart russell, who are very concerned about existential thoracic ai. and often the concern is about value misalignment. so ai systems basically working, operating towards goals that are not the same as human civilization, human beings. so it seems game theory has a role to play there to make sure the values are aligned with human beings. i don't know if that's how you think about it. if not, how do you think ai might help with this problem? how do you think ai might make the world safer? yeah, i think this value misalignment is a fairly theoretical worry. and i haven't really seen it in it because i do a lot of real applications. i don't see it anywhere. the closest i've seen it was the following type of mental exercise, really, where i had this argument in the late 80s when we were building these transportation optimization systems. and somebody had heard that it's a good idea to have high utilization of assets. so they told me, hey, why don't you put that as an objective? and we didn't even put it as an objective, because i just showed him that if you had that as your objective, the solution would be to load your trucks full and drive in circles. nothing would ever get delivered. you'd have 100 utilization. so yeah, i know this phenomenon. i've known this for over 30 years, but i've never seen it actually be a problem in reality. and yes, if you have the wrong objective, the ai will optimize that to the hilt. and it's going to hurt more than some human who's trying to solve it in a half-baked way with some human insight, too. but i just haven't seen that materialized in practice. there's this gap that you've actually put your finger on very clearly just now between theory and reality that's very difficult to put into words, i think. it's what you can theoretically imagine, the worst possible case or even, yeah, i mean, bad cases and what usually happens in reality. so for example, to me, maybe it's something you can comment on. i grew up in the soviet union. there's currently 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world. and for many decades, it's theoretically surprising to me that the nuclear war is not broken out. do you think about this aspect from a game theoretic perspective in general? why is that true? why in theory, you could see how things would go terribly wrong and somehow yet, they have not? yeah. how do you think about that? so i do think about that a lot. i think the biggest two threats that we're facing as mankind, one is climate change and the other is nuclear war. so those are my main two worries that i worry about. and i've tried to do something about climate. i thought about trying to do something for climate change twice. actually, for two of my startups, i've actually commissioned studies of what we could do on those things. and we didn't really find a sweet spot, but i'm still keeping an eye out on that. if there's something where we could actually provide a market solution or optimization solution or some other technology solution to problems. right now, for example, pollution credit markets was what we were looking at then. and it was much more the lack of political will by those markets were not so successful rather than bad market design. so i could go in and make a better market design, but that wouldn't really move the needle on the world very much if there's no political will. and in the us, the market, at least the chicago market was just shut down and so on. so then it doesn't really help how great your market design was. and then your nuclear side, it's more, it's more, so global warming is a more encroaching problem. nuclear weapons have been here. it's an obvious problem that's just been sitting there. so how do you think about what is the mechanism of design there that just made everything seem stable? and are you still extremely worried? i am still extremely worried. so you probably know the simple game theory of mad. so this was a mutually assured destruction and it doesn't require any computation with small matrices. you can actually convince yourself that the game is such that nobody wants to initiate. yeah, that's a very coarse grained analysis. and it really works in a situational way. you have two superpowers or small number of superpowers. now things are very different. you have a smaller nooks. so the threshold of initiating is smaller and you have smaller countries and non-nation actors who may get nooks and so on. so i think it's riskier now than it was maybe ever before. and what idea application of ai, you've talked about a little bit, but what is the most exciting to you right now? i mean, you're here at nips, neurips now, you have a few excellent pieces of work, but what are you thinking into the future with several companies you're doing? what's the most exciting thing or one of the exciting things? the number one thing for me right now is coming up with these scalable techniques for game solving and applying them into the real world. i'm still very interested in market design as well. and we're doing that in the optimized markets, but i'm most interested if number one right now is strategic machine strategy robot getting that technology out there and seeing as you're in the trenches doing applications, what needs to be actually filled, what technology gaps still need to be filled. so it's so hard to just put your feet on the table and imagine what needs to be done. but when you're actually doing real applications, the applications tell you what needs to be done. and i really enjoy that interaction. is it a challenging process to apply some of the state of the art techniques you're working on and having the various players in industry or the military or people who could really benefit from it actually use it? what's that process of, you know, in autonomous vehicles will work with automotive companies and they're in many ways are a little bit old fashioned, it's difficult. they really want to use this technology, this clearly will have a significant benefit, but the systems aren't quite in place to easily have them integrated in terms of data, in terms of compute, in terms of all these kinds of things. so is that one of the bigger challenges that you're facing and how do you tackle that challenge? yeah, i think that's always a challenge. that's kind of slowness and inertia really, of let's do things the way we've always done it. you just have to find the internal champions that the customer who understand that, hey, things can't be the same way in the future. otherwise, bad things are going to happen. and it's in autonomous vehicles, it's actually very interesting that the car makers are doing that, then they're very traditional. but at the same time, you have tech companies who have nothing to do with cars or transportation, google and baidu really pushing on autonomous cars. i find that fascinating. clearly, you're super excited about actually these ideas having an impact in the world. in terms of the technology, in terms of ideas and research, are there directions that you're also excited about? whether that's on the some of the approaches you talked about for the imperfect information games, whether it's applying deep learning to some of these problems, is there something that you're excited in the research side of things? yeah, lots of different things in the game solving. solving even bigger games, games where you have more hidden action of the player actions as well. poker is a game where really the chance actions are hidden, or some of them are hidden, but the player actions are public. multiplayer games of various sorts, collusion, opponent exploitation, and even longer games. some games that basically go forever, but they're not repeated. so, see extensive form games that go forever. what would that even look ? how do you represent that? how do you solve that? what's an example of a game that? are these some of the stochastic games that you mentioned? let's say business strategy. and not just modeling a particular interaction, but thinking about the business from here to eternity. or let's say military strategy. so, it's not war is going to go away. how do you think about military strategy that's going to go forever? how do you even model that? how do you know whether a move was good that somebody made? and so on. so, that's kind of one direction. i'm also very interested in learning much more scalable techniques for integer programming. so, we had an icml paper this summer on that. the first automated algorithm configuration paper that has theoretical generalization guarantees. so, if i see this many training examples and i tool my algorithm in this way, it's going to have good performance on the real distribution, which i've not seen. so, which is kind of interesting that algorithm configuration has been going on now for at least 17 years seriously. and there has not been any generalization theory before. well, this is really exciting. and it's a huge honor to talk to you. thank you so much tomas. thank you for bringing lebron to the world and all the great work you're doing. well, thank you very much. it's been fun. good questions.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

hire people that i can learn from, number one. i mean, i'm a hacker in the sense that i, my approach has always been do whatever it takes to make it work so that i can see and feel the thing and then learn what needs to come next. and oftentimes what needs to come next is a matter of being able to bring it to more people, which is scale. and there's a lot of great people out there that either have experience or are extremely fast learners that we've been lucky enough to find and work with for years. but i think a lot of it, we benefit a ton from the open source community and just all the learnings there that are laid bare in the open. all the mistakes, all the success, all the problems. it's a very slow moving process usually open source, but it's very deliberate. and you get to see because of the pace, you get to see what it takes to really build something meaningful. so i learned most of everything i learned about hacking and programming and engineering has been due to open source and the generosity that people have given to give up their time, sacrifice their time without any expectation in return other than being a part of something much larger than themselves, which i think is great. the open source movement is amazing. but if you just look at the scale, square has to take care of, is this fundamentally a software problem or hardware problem? you mentioned hiring a bunch of people, but it's not maybe from our perspective, not often talked about how incredible that is to sort of have a system that doesn't go down often, that is secure, is able to take care of all these transactions. like maybe i'm also a hacker at heart and it's incredible to me that that kind of scale could be achieved. is there some insight, some lessons, some interesting tidbits that you can say about how to make that scale happen? is it the hardware fundamentally challenge? is it a software challenge? is it , is it a social challenge of building large teams of engineers that work together, that kind of thing? like what's the interesting challenges there? by the way, you're the best stress hacker i've met. i think the- thank you, by the way. thank you. if the enumeration you just went through, i don't think there's one, you have to kind of focus on all and the ability to focus on all that really comes down to how you face problems and whether you can break them down into parts that you can focus on. because i think the biggest mistake is trying to solve or address too many at once, or not going deep enough with the questions or not being critical of the answers you find, or not taking the time to form credible hypotheses that you can actually test and you can see the results of. so all of those fall in the face of ultimately critical thinking skills, problem solving skills. and if there's one skill i wanna improve every day, it's that, that's what contributes to learning and the only way we can evolve any of these things is learning what it's currently doing and how to take it to the next step. and questioning assumptions, the first principles kind of thinking seems fundamental to this whole process. yeah, but if you get too overextended into, well, this is a hardware issue, you miss all the software solutions. and vice versa, if you focus too much on the software, there are hardware solutions that can 10x the thing. so i try to resist the categories of thinking and look for the underlying systems that make all these things work. but those only emerge when you have a skill around creative thinking, problem solving, and being able to ask critical questions and having the patience to go deep. so one of the amazing things, if you look at the mission of square, is to increase people's access to the economy. maybe you can correct me if i'm wrong, that's from my perspective. so from the perspective of merchants, peer-to-peer payments, even crypto, cryptocurrency, digital cryptocurrency, what do you see as the major ways our society can increase participation in the economy? so if we look at today and the next 10 years, next 20 years, you go into africa, maybe in africa, and all kinds of other places outside of north america. if there was one word that i think represents what we're trying to do at square, it is that word access. one of the things we found is that we weren't expecting this at all. when we started, we thought we were just building a piece of hardware to enable people to plug it into their phone and swipe a credit card. and then as we talked with people who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past, we found a consistent theme, which many of them weren't even enabled, and enabled but allowed to process credit cards. and we dug a little bit deeper, again, asking that question. and we found that a lot of them would go to banks or these merchant acquirers, and waiting for them was a credit check and looking at a fica score. and many of the businesses that we talked to and many small businesses, they don't have good credit or a credit history. they're entrepreneurs who are just getting started, taking a lot of personal risk, financial risk. and it just felt ridiculous to us that for the job of being able to accept money from people, you had to get your credit checked. and as we dug deeper, we realized that that wasn't the intention of the financial industry, but it's the only tool they had available to them to understand authenticity, intent, predictor of future behavior. so that's the first thing we actually looked at. and that's where the, we built the hardware, but the software really came in in terms of risk modeling. and that's when we started down the path that eventually leads to ai. we started with a very strong data science discipline because we knew that our business was not necessarily about making hardware, it was more about enabling more people to come into the system. so the fundamental challenge there is, so to enable more people to come into the system, you have to lower the barrier of checking that that person will be a legitimate vendor. is that the fundamental problem here? yeah, and a different mindset. i think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset of kind of distrust and just constantly looking for opportunities to prove why people shouldn't get into the system, whereas we took on a mindset of trust and then verify, verify, verify, verify, verify. so we moved, when we entered the space, only about 30 to 40 of the people who applied to accept credit cards would actually get through the system. we took that number and we moved to the system. credit cards would actually get through the system. we took that number to 99. and that's because we reframed the problem. we built credible models and we had this mindset of we're going to watch not at the merchant level, but we're gonna watch at the transaction level. so come in, perform some transactions, and as long as you're doing things that feel high integrity, credible, and don't look suspicious, we'll continue to serve you. if we see any interestingness in how you use our system, that will be bubbled up to people to review, to figure out if there's something nefarious going on, and that's when we might ask you to leave. so the change in the mindset led to the technology that we needed to enable more people to get through and to enable more people to access the system. what role does machine learning play in that context? you said, first of all, that's a beautiful shift. anytime you shift your viewpoint into seeing that people are fundamentally good, and then you just have to verify and catch the ones who are not, as opposed to assuming everybody's bad, this is a beautiful thing. so what role does the, do you, throughout the history of the company, has machine learning played in doing that verification? it was immediate. i mean, we weren't calling it machine learning, but it was data science. and then as the industry evolved, machine learning became more of the nomenclature, and as that evolved, it became more sophisticated with deep learning, and as that continues to evolve, it'll be another thing. but they're all in the same vein. but we built that discipline up within the first year of the company. because we also had, we had to partner with the bank, we had to partner with visa mastercard, and we had to show that by bringing more people into the system, that we could do so in a responsible way that would not compromise their systems and that they would trust us. how do you convince this upstart company with some cool machine learning tricks is able to deliver on this sort of trustworthy set of merchants? we staged it out in tiers. we had a bucket of 500 people using it, and then we showed results, and then 1,000, and then 10,000, and then 50,000, and then the constraint was lifted. so again, it's kind of, getting something tangible out there. i wanna show what we can do rather than talk about it. and that put a lot of pressure on us to do the right things. and it also created a culture of accountability, of a little bit more transparency, and i think incentivized all of our early folks and the company in the right way. so what does the future look in terms of increasing people's access? or if you look at iot, internet of things, there's more and more intelligent devices. you can see there's some people even talking about our personal data as a thing that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly. sort of everything can become part of the economy. do you see, so what does the future of square look in sort of giving people access in all kinds of ways to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers? i believe that the currency we use is a huge part of the answer. and i believe that the internet deserves and requires a native currency. and that's why i'm such a huge believer in bitcoin, because it just, our biggest problem as a company right now is we cannot act an internet company. open a new market, we have to have a partnership with a local bank. we have to pay attention to different regulatory onboarding environments. and a digital currency bitcoin takes a bunch of that away where we can potentially launch a product in every single market around the world because they're all using the same currency. and we have consistent understanding of regulation and onboarding and what that means. so i think the internet continuing to be accessible to people is number one. and then i think currency is number two. and it will just allow for a lot more innovation, a lot more speed in terms of what we can build and others can build. and it's just really exciting. so i mean, i wanna be able to see that and feel that in my lifetime. so in this aspect and in other aspects, you have a deep interest in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger tech in general. i talked to vitalik buterin yesterday on this podcast. he says hi, by the way. hey. he's a brilliant, brilliant person. talked a lot about bitcoin and ethereum, of course. so can you maybe linger on this point? what do you find appealing about bitcoin, about digital currency? where do you see it going in the next 10, 20 years? and what are some of the challenges with respect to square, but also just bigger for our globally, for our world, for the way we think about money? i think the most beautiful thing about it is there's no one person setting the direction. and there's no one person on the other side that can stop it. so we have something that is pretty organic in nature and very principled in its original design. and i think the bitcoin white paper is one of the most seminal works of computer science in the last 20, 30 years. it's poetry. i mean, it really is. it's pretty cool technology. i mean, that's not often talked about. sort of there's so much sort of hype around digital currency about the financial impacts of it, the natural impacts of it, but the actual technology is quite beautiful from a computer science perspective. yeah, and the underlying principles behind it that went into it, even to the point of releasing it under a pseudonym. i think that's a very, very powerful statement. the timing of when it was released is powerful. it was a total activist move. i mean, it's moving the world forward in a way that i think is extremely noble and honorable and enables everyone to be part of the story, which is also really cool. so you asked the question around 10 years and 20 years. i mean, i think the amazing thing is no one knows. and it can emerge and every person that comes into the ecosystem, whether they be a developer or someone who uses it, can change its direction in small and large ways. and that's what i think it should be because that's what the internet has shown is possible. now there's complications with that, of course. and there's certainly companies that own large parts of the internet and can direct it more than others. and there's not equal access to every single person in the world just yet. but all those problems are visible enough to speak about them. and to me, that gives confidence that they're solvable in a relatively short timeframe. i think the world is moving forward and i think the world changes a lot as we get these satellites projecting the internet down to earth, because it just removes a bunch of the former constraints and really levels the playing field. but a global currency, which a native currency for the internet is a proxy for, is a very powerful concept. and i don't think any one person on this planet truly understands the ramifications of that. i think there's a lot of positives to it. there's some negatives as well. but i think it's possible, sorry to interrupt, do you think it's possible that this kind of digital currency would redefine the nature of money to become the main currency of the world as opposed to being tied to fiat currency of different nations and sort of really push the decentralization of control of money? definitely, but i think the bigger ramification is how it affects how society works. and i think there are many positive ramifications outside of just money. outside of just money. money is a foundational layer that enables so much more. i was meeting with an entrepreneur in ethiopia and payments is probably the number one problem to solve across the continent, both in terms of moving money across borders between nations on the continent or the amount of corruption within the current system. but the lack of easy ways to pay people makes starting anything really difficult. i met an entrepreneur who started the lyft slash uber of ethiopia and one of the biggest problems she has is that it's not easy for her writers to pay the company and it's not easy for her to pay the drivers. and that definitely has stunted her growth and made everything more challenging. so the fact that she even has to think about payments instead of thinking about the best writer experience and the best driver experience is pretty telling. so i think as we get a more durable, resilient and global standard, we see a lot more innovation everywhere. and i think there's no better case study for this than the various countries within africa and their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things within health or sustainability or transportation or a lot of the companies that we've seen here. so the majority of companies i met in november when i spent a month on the continent were payments oriented. you mentioned, and this is a small tangent, you mentioned the anonymous launch of bitcoin is a sort of profound philosophical statement. pseudonymous. what's that even mean? there's a pseudonym. first of all, let me ask. there's an identity tied to it. it's not just anonymous, it's nakamoto. so nakamoto might represent one person or multiple people. but. let me ask, are you satoshi nakamoto? just checking. no, and if i were, what would i tell you? yeah, that's true. but. maybe you slip. a pseudonym is constructed identity. anonymity is just kind of this random, drop something off and leave. there's no intention to build an identity around it. and while the identity being built was a short time window, it was meant to stick around, i think, and to be known. and it's being honored in, you know, how the community thinks about building it. like the concept of satoshi's, for instance, is one such example. but i think it was smart not to do it anonymous, not to do it as a real identity, but to do it as pseudonym, because i think it builds tangibility and a little bit of empathy that this was a human or a set of humans behind it. and there's this natural identity that i can imagine. but there is also a sacrifice of ego. that's a pretty powerful thing from the perspective. yeah, which is beautiful. would you do, sort of philosophically, to ask you the question, would you do all the same things you're doing now if your name wasn't attached to it? sort of if you had to sacrifice the ego? put another way, is your ego deeply tied in the decisions you've been making? i hope not. i mean, i believe i would certainly attempt to do the things without my name having to be attached with it. but it's hard to do that in a corporation legally. that's the issue. if i were to do more open source things, then absolutely. like i don't need my particular identity, my real identity associated with it. but i think the appreciation that comes from doing something good and being able to see it and see people use it is pretty overwhelming and powerful, more so than maybe seeing your name in the headlines. let's talk about artificial intelligence a little bit, if we could. 70 years ago, alan turing formulated the turing test. to me, natural language is one of the most interesting spaces of problems that are tackled by artificial intelligence. it's the canonical problem of what it means to be intelligent. he formulated it as the turing test. let me ask sort of the broad question. how hard do you think is it to pass the turing test in the space of language? just from a very practical standpoint, i think where we are now and for at least years out is one where the artificial intelligence, machine learning, the deep learning models can bubble up interestingness very, very quickly and pair that with human discretion around severity, around depth, around nuance and meaning. i think for me, the chasm across for general intelligence is to be able to explain why and the meaning behind something. behind a decision? so being able to tell stories. behind a decision or a set of data. so the explainability part is kind of essential to be able to explain using natural language why the decisions were made, that kind of thing. yeah, i mean, i think that's one of our biggest risks in artificial intelligence going forward is we are building a lot of black boxes that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision or what criteria they used to make the decision. and we're trusting them more and more from lending decisions to content recommendation, to driving, to health. like a lot of us have watches that tell us to understand. how was it deciding that? i mean, that one's pretty simple. but you can imagine how complex they get. and being able to explain the reasoning behind some of those recommendations seems to be an essential part. although it's hard. which is a very hard problem because sometimes even we can't explain why we make decisions. that's what i was, i think we're being sometimes a little bit unfair to artificial intelligence systems because we're not very good at some of these things. do you think, apologize for the ridiculous romanticized question, but on that line of thought, do you think we'll ever be able to build a system in the movie her that you could fall in love with? so have that kind of deep connection with. hasn't that already happened? hasn't someone in japan fallen in love with his ai? there's always going to be somebody that does that kind of thing. i mean, at a much larger scale of actually building relationships, of being deeper connections. it doesn't have to be love, but it just deeper connections with artificial intelligence systems. so you mentioned explainability. that's less a function of the artificial intelligence and more a function of the individual and how they find meaning and where they find meaning. do you think we humans can find meaning in technology in this kind of way? yeah, yeah, 100. and i don't necessarily think it's a negative, but it's constantly going to evolve. so i don't know, but meaning is something that's entirely subjective. and i don't think it's going to be a function of finding the magic algorithm that enables everyone to love it. but maybe, i don't know. that question really gets at the difference between human and machine. you had a little bit of an exchange with elon musk. basically, i mean, it's a trivial version of that, but i think there's a more fundamental question of is it possible to tell the difference between a bot and a human? and do you think it's, if we look into the future, 10, 20 years out, do you think it would be possible or is it even necessary to tell the difference in the digital space between a human and a robot? can we have fulfilling relationships with each or do we need to tell the difference between them? i think it's certainly useful in certain problem domains to be able to tell the difference. and i think in others, it might not be as useful. i think it's possible for us today to tell that difference. it's the reverse, the meta of the turing test. well, what's interesting is i think the technology to create is moving much faster than the technology to detect. do you think so? so if you look at adversarial machine learning, there's a lot of systems that try to fool machine learning systems. and at least for me, the hope is that the technology to defend will always be right there, at least. your sense is that... i don't know if they'll be right there. i mean, it's a race, right? so the detection technologies have to be two or 10 steps ahead of the creation technologies. this is a problem that i think the financial industry will face more and more because a lot of our risk models, for instance, are built around identity. payments ultimately comes down to identity. and you can imagine a world where all this conversation around deep fakes goes towards the direction of driver's license or passports or state identities. and people construct identities in order to get through a system such as ours to start accepting credit cards or into the cash app. and those technologies seem to be moving very, very quickly. our ability to detect them, i think, is probably lagging at this point, but certainly with more focus, we can get ahead of it. but this is gonna touch everything. so i think it's security. we're never going to be able to build a perfect detection system. we're only going to be able to, what we should be focused on is the speed of evolving it and being able to take signals that show correctness or errors as quickly as possible and move and to be able to build that into our newer models or the self-learning models. do you have other worries, some people, elon and others have worries of existential threats of artificial intelligence, of artificial general intelligence, or if you think more narrowly about threats and concerns about more narrow artificial intelligence, what are your thoughts in this domain? do you have concerns or are you more optimistic? i think yuval, in his book 21 lessons for the 21st century, his last chapter is around meditation. and you look at the title of the chapter and you're , , it's all meditation. but what was interesting about that chapter is he believes that kids being born today, growing up today, google has a stronger sense of their preferences than they do, which you can easily imagine. i can easily imagine today that google probably knows my preferences more than my mother does, maybe not me per se, but for someone growing up only knowing the internet, only knowing what google is capable of, or facebook, or twitter, or square, or any of these things, the self-awareness is being offloaded to other systems and particularly these algorithms. and his concern is that we lose that self-awareness because the self-awareness is now outside of us and it's doing such a better job at helping us direct our decisions around, should i stand? should i walk today? what doctor should i choose? who should i date? all these things we're now seeing play out very quickly. so he sees meditation as a tool to build that self-awareness and to bring the focus back on, why do i make these decisions? why do i react in this way? why did i have this thought? where did that come from? that's a way to regain control. or awareness, maybe not control, but awareness so that you can be aware that yes, i am offloading this decision to this algorithm that i don't fully understand and can't tell me why it's doing the things it's doing because it's so complex. that's not to say that the algorithm can't be a good thing. and to me, recommender systems, the best of what they can do is to help guide you on a journey of learning new ideas of learning period. it can be a great thing, but do you know you're doing that? are you aware that you're inviting it to do that to you? i think that's the risk he identifies. that's perfectly okay. but are you aware that you have that invitation and it's being acted upon? and so that's a concern. you're kind of highlighting that without a lack of awareness, you can just be floating at sea. so awareness is key in the future of these artificial intelligence systems. the other movie, wall-e, which i think is one of pixar's best movies besides ratatouille. ratatouille was incredible. you had me until ratatouille, okay. ratatouille was incredible. all right, we've come to the first point where we disagree. okay. it's the entrepreneurial story in the form of a rat. i just remember just the soundtrack was really good. excellent. what are your thoughts sticking on artificial intelligence a little bit about the displacement of jobs? that's another perspective that candidates andrew yang talk about. yang gang forever. yang gang. so he unfortunately, speaking of yang gang, has recently dropped out. i know, it was very disappointing and depressing. yeah, but on the positive side, he's i think launching a podcast. so- really? cool. yeah, he just announced that. i'm sure he'll try to talk you into trying to come onto the podcast. i would love to. what about ratatouille? yeah, maybe he'll be more welcoming of the ratatouille argument. what are your thoughts on his concerns of the displacement of jobs, of automation? of course, there's positive impacts that could come from automation and ai, but there could also be negative impacts. and within that framework, what are your thoughts about universal basic income? so these interesting new ideas of how we can empower people in the economy. i think he was 100 right on almost every dimension. we see this in square's business. i mean, he identified truck drivers from missouri, and he certainly pointed to the concern and the issue that people from where i'm from feel every single day that is often invisible and not talked about enough. you know, the next big one is cashiers. this is where it pertains to square's business. we are seeing more and more of the point of sale move to the individual customer's hand in the form of their phone and apps and pre-order and order ahead. we're seeing more kiosks. we're seeing more things amazon go. and the number of workers as a cashier in retail is immense. and there's no real answers on how they transform their skills and work into something else. and i think that does lead to a lot of really negative ramifications. and the important point that he brought up around universal basic income is given that the shift is going to come and given it is going to take time to set people up with new skills and new careers, they need to have a floor to be able to survive. and this $1,000 a month is such a floor. it's not going to incentivize you to quit your job because it's not enough, but it will enable you to not have to worry as much about just getting on day to day so that you can focus on what am i going to do now and what skills do i need to acquire? and i think a lot of people point to the fact that during the industrial age, we had the same concerns around automation, factory lines and everything worked out okay. but the biggest change is just the velocity and the centralization of a lot of the things that make this work, which is the data and the algorithms that work on this data. i think the second biggest scary thing is just around ai is just who actually owns the data and who can operate on it. and are we able to share the insights from the data so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs or help our business or whatnot? so that's where i think regulation could play a strong and positive part. first, looking at the primitives of ai and the tools we use to build these services that will ultimately touch every single aspect of the human experience. and then where data is owned and how it's shared. so those are the answers that as a society, as a world, we need to have better answers around, which we're currently not. they're just way too centralized into a few very, very large companies. but i think it was spot on with identifying the problem and proposing solutions that would actually work. at least that we'd learned from them, you could expand or evolve, but it's not a big deal. it's not a big deal to expand or evolve. but i mean, i think ubi is well past its due. it was certainly trumpeted by martin luther king and even before him as well. and you said, the exact thousand dollar mark might not be the correct one, but you should take the steps to try to implement these solutions and see what works. 100. and i've had similar diets, at least i was. the first time i've heard this. yeah, so i was doing it. first time anyone has said that to me in this case. yeah, but it's becoming more and more cool. but i was doing it before it was cool. so intermittent fasting and fasting in general, i really enjoy, i love food, but i enjoy the, i also love suffering because i'm russian. so fasting kind of makes you appreciate the, makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow. so, but i have, outside the philosophical stuff, i have a more specific question. it also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker, from the scientific perspective, to sit there for many hours and focus deeply. maybe you were a hacker before you were ceo. what have you learned about diet, lifestyle, mindset that helps you maximize mental performance, to be able to focus for, to think deeply in this world of distractions? i think i just took it for granted for too long. which aspect? just the social structure of we eat three meals a day and there's snacks in between. and i just never really asked the question why. oh, by the way, in case people don't know, i think a lot of people know, but you at least, you famously eat once a day. you still eat once a day? yep, i eat dinner. by the way, what made you decide to eat once a day? because to me, that was a huge revolution, that you don't have to eat breakfast. that was , i felt i was a rebel. like i abandoned my parents or something and became an anarchist. when you first, the first week you start doing it, it feels you kind of have a superpower. then you realize it's not really a superpower. but i think you realize, at least i realized it just how much our minds dictates what we're possible with. and sometimes we have structures around us that incentivize this three meal a day thing, which was purely social structure versus necessity for our health and for our bodies. and i did it just, i started doing it because i played a lot with my diet when i was a kid and i was vegan for two years and just went all over the place. just because i, you know, health is the most precious thing we have and none of us really understand it. so being able to ask the question through experiments that i can perform on myself and learn about is compelling to me. and i heard this one guy on a podcast, wim hof, who's famous for doing ice baths and holding his breath and all these things. he said he only eats one meal a day. i'm , wow, that sounds super challenging and uncomfortable. i'm gonna do it. so i just, i learned the most when i make myself, i wouldn't say suffer, but when i make myself feel uncomfortable because everything comes to bear in those moments and you really learn what you're about or what you're not. so i've been doing that my whole life. like when i was a kid, i could not, i was, i could not speak. like i had to go to a speech therapist and it made me extremely shy. and then one day i realized i can't keep doing this and i signed up for the speech club and it was the most uncomfortable thing i could imagine doing, getting a topic on a note card, having five minutes to write a speech about whatever that topic is, not being able to use the note card while speaking and speaking for five minutes about that topic. so, but it just, it puts so much, it gave me so much perspective around the power of communication, around my own deficiencies and around if i set my mind to do something, i'll do it. so it gave me a lot more confidence. so i see fasting in the same light. this is something that was interesting, challenging, uncomfortable, and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result. and it will lead to other things that i'll experiment with and play with. but yeah, it does feel a little bit a superpower sometimes. the most boring superpower one can imagine. no, it's quite incredible. the clarity of mind is pretty interesting. speaking of suffering, you kind of talk about facing difficult ideas. you meditate, you think about the broad context of life, of our society. let me ask sort of, apologize again for the romanticized question, but do you ponder your own mortality? do you think about death, about the finiteness of human existence when you meditate, when you think about it? and if you do, how do you make sense of it, that this thing ends? well, i don't try to make sense of it. i do think about it every day. i mean, it's a daily, multiple times a day. are you afraid of death? no, i'm not afraid of it. i think it's a transformation. i don't know to what, but it's also a tool to feel the importance of every moment. so i just use as a reminder, i have an hour. is this really what i'm going to spend the hour doing? i only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch. i'm not going to get up for it. i'm not going to make sure that i try to see it. so it just puts a lot into perspective and it helps me prioritize. i think it's, i don't see it as something that's , that i dread or is dreadful. it's a tool that is available to every single person to use every day because it shows how precious life is. and there's reminders every single day, whether it be your own health or a friend or a coworker or something you see in the news. so to me, it's just a question of what we do with our daily reminder. and for me, it's, am i really focused on what matters? and sometimes that might be work. sometimes that might be friendships or family or relationships or whatnot, but that's, it's the ultimate clarifier in that sense. so on the question of what matters, another ridiculously big question of once you try to make sense of it, what do you think is the meaning of it all? the meaning of life? what gives you purpose, happiness, meaning? a lot does. i mean, just being able to be aware of the fact that i'm alive is pretty meaningful. the connections i feel with individuals, whether they're people i just meet or long lasting friendships or my family is meaningful. seeing people use something that i helped build is really meaningful and powerful to me. but that sense of, i mean, i think ultimately it comes down to a sense of connection and just feeling i am bigger. i am part of something that's bigger than myself and i can feel it directly in small ways or large ways, however it manifests is probably it. last question, do you think we're living in a simulation? i don't know, it's a pretty fun one if we are, but also crazy and random and brought with tons of problems. but yeah. would you have it any other way? yeah. i mean, i just think it's taken us way too long as a planet to realize we're all in this together and we all are connected in very significant ways. i think we hide our connectivity very well through ego, through whatever it is of the day, but that is the one thing i would wanna work towards changing and that's how i would have it another way. cause if we can't do that, then how are we gonna connect to all the other simulations? cause that's the next step is , what's happening in the other simulation. escaping this one and yeah. spanning across the multiple simulations and sharing it and on the fun. i don't think there's a better way to end it. jack, thank you so much for all the work you do. there's probably other ways that we've ended this and other simulations that may have been better. we'll have to wait and see. thanks so much for talking to me. thank you. thanks for listening to this conversation with jack dorsey and thank you to our sponsor, masterclass. please consider supporting this podcast by signing up to masterclass at slash lex. if you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcast, support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman. and now let me leave you with some words about bitcoin from paul graham. i'm very intrigued by bitcoin. it has all the signs of a paradigm shift. hackers love it yet it is described as a toy just micro computers. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\", 'completion': 'spoken'}\n",

a the author was likely inspired by a desire to shed light on the often overlooked role of women in maritime history and challenge traditional gender norms. q how did these women manage to defy societal expectations? a these women demonstrated courage, determination, and resilience in the face of adversity. they also found support from -minded individuals who encouraged and empowered them to pursue their dreams. q what can we learn from their stories? a we can learn the importance of embracing our passions, standing up for our beliefs, and overcoming obstacles through determination and resilience. 8. pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller once upon a time, in a world where the sea was dominated by men, there were brave and adventurous women who dared to defy societal norms. some of these women became pirate queens, anne bonny and mary read, who sailed the high seas and fought alongside their male counterparts. others, ellen macarthur, broke records as sailors, proving that women could be just as skilled and fearless as men. then there were the women who took matters into their own hands, elizabeth black betty thayres, who disguised herself as a man and stowed away on a whaling ship. these women showed incredible courage and determination, proving that nothing could hold them back. these stories remind us that no matter what society tells us, we all have the power to pursue our dreams and break free from constraints. so let's remember the lessons of these brave women and always believe in ourselves, no matter what others may say.\", 'completion': 'written'}\n",
