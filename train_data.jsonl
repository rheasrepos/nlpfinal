{"text":" The following is a conversation with Jeremy Howard. He's the founder of Fast AI, a research institute dedicated to making deep learning more accessible. He's also a distinguished research scientist at the University of San Francisco, a former president of Kaggle, as well as a top ranking competitor there. And in general, he's a successful entrepreneur, educator, researcher, and an inspiring personality in the AI community. When someone asks me, how do I get started with deep learning? Fast AI is one of the top places I point them to. It's free, it's easy to get started, it's insightful and accessible, and if I may say so, it has very little BS. It can sometimes dilute the value of educational content on popular topics like deep learning. Fast AI has a focus on practical application of deep learning and hands-on exploration of the cutting edge that is incredibly both accessible to beginners and useful to experts.

And now, here's my conversation with Jeremy Howard. What's the first program you ever written? First program I wrote that I remember would be at high school. I did an assignment where I decided to try to find out if there were some better musical scales than the normal 12 tone, 12 interval scale. So I wrote a program on my Commodore 64 in BASIC that searched through other scale sizes to see if it could find one where there were more accurate harmonies. Like mid-tone? It's like you want an actual exactly three to two ratio whereas with a 12 interval scale, it's not exactly three to two, for example. So that's well-tempered, as they say in the. And BASIC on a Commodore 64. Where was the interest in music from? Or is it just technical? I did music all my life. So I played saxophone and clarinet and piano and guitar and drums and whatever. How does that thread go through your life? Where's music today? It's not where I wish it was. For various reasons, couldn't really keep it going, particularly because I had a lot of problems with RSI, with my fingers, and so I had to kind of like cut back anything that used hands and fingers. I hope one day I'll be able to get back to it health-wise. So there's a love for music underlying it all. For sure, yeah. What's your favorite instrument? Saxophone. Sax. I've heard of the baritone saxophone. Well, probably bass saxophone, but they're awkward. Well, I always love it when music is coupled with programming. There's something about a brain that utilizes those that emerges with creative ideas. So you've used and studied quite a few programming languages. Can you give an overview of what you've used? What are the pros and cons of each? Well, my favorite programming environment, almost certainly was Microsoft Access back in the earliest days. So that was the official basic for applications, which is not a good programming language, but the programming environment was fantastic. It's like the ability to create user interfaces and tie data and actions to them and create reports and all that, as I've never seen anything as good. There's things nowadays like Airtable, which are like small subsets of that, which people love for good reason, but unfortunately nobody's ever achieved anything like that. What is that? If you could pause on that for a second. Oh, Access. Is it fundamentally a database? It was a database program that Microsoft produced, part of Office, and kind of withered. But basically it lets you in a totally graphical way create tables and relationships and queries and tie them to forms and set up event handlers and calculations. And it was a very complete, powerful system designed for not massive scalable things, but for useful little applications that I loved. So what's the connection between Excel and Access? So very close. So Access kind of was the relational database equivalent, if you like. So people still do a lot of that stuff that should be in Access in Excel, because they know it. Excel's great as well. But it's just not as rich a programming model as VBA combined with a relational database. And so I've always loved relational databases, but today programming on top of relational databases is just a lot more of a headache. You generally either need to kind of, you know, you need something that connects, that runs some kind of database server, unless you use SQLite, which has its own issues. Then you kind of often, if you want to get a nice programming model, you'll need to like create an add an ORM on top. And then, I don't know, there's all these pieces tied together, and it's just a lot more awkward than it should be. There are people that are trying to make it easier. So in particular, I think of F-Sharp, you know, Don Syme, who him and his team have done a great job of making something like a database appear in the type system. So you actually get like tab completion for fields and tables and stuff like that. Anyway, so that was kind of, anyway, so like that whole VBA office thing, I guess, was a starting point, which I still miss. I got into standard visual basic, which- That's interesting just to pause on that for a second. It's interesting that you're connecting programming languages to the ease of management of data. Yeah. So in your use of programming languages, you always had a love and a connection with data. I've always been interested in doing useful things for myself and for others, which generally means getting some data and doing something with it and putting it out there again. So that's been my interest throughout. So I also did a lot of stuff with Apple script back in the early days. So it's kind of nice being able to get the computer and computers to talk to each other and to do things for you. And then I think that one, the programming language I most loved then would have been Delphi, which was Object Pascal, created by Anders Halsberg, who previously did Turbo Pascal and then went on to create.NET and then went on to create TypeScript. Delphi was amazing because it was like a compiled, fast language that was as easy to use as Visual Basic. Delphi, what is it similar to in more modern languages? Visual Basic. Visual Basic. Yeah, but a compiled fast version. So I'm not sure there's anything quite like it anymore if you took like C-Sharp or Java and got rid of the virtual machine and replaced it with something you could compile a small type binary. I feel like it's where Swift could get to with the new Swift UI and the cross-platform development going on. Like that's one of my dreams is that we'll hopefully get back to where Delphi was. There is actually a free Pascal project nowadays called Lazarus, which is also attempting to kind of recreate Delphi. So they're making good progress. So, okay, Delphi, that's one of your favorite programming languages. Or at least programming environments. Again, I say Pascal's not a nice language. If you wanted to know specifically about what languages I like, I would definitely pick J as being an amazingly wonderful language. What's J? J, are you aware of APL? I am not, except from doing a little research on the work you've done. Okay, so not at all surprising you're not familiar with it because it's not well known, but it's actually one of the main families of programming languages going back to the late 50s, early 60s. So there was a couple of major directions. One was the kind of lambda calculus, Alonzo Church direction, which I guess kind of Lisp and Scheme and whatever, which has a history going back to the early days of computing. The second was the kind of imperative slash OO, algo, simula, going under C, C++, so forth. There was a third, which are called array-oriented languages, which started with a paper by a guy called Ken Iverson, which was actually a math theory paper, not a programming paper. It was called Notation as a Tool for Thought. And it was the development of a new type of math notation. And the idea is that this math notation was much more flexible, expressive, and also well-defined than traditional math notation, which is none of those things, math notation is awful. And so he actually turned that into a programming language because this was the late 50s, all the names were available. So he called his language a programming language or APL. APL, wow. So APL is a implementation of notation as a tool for thought, by which he means math notation. And Ken and his son went on to do many things, but eventually they actually produced a new language that was built on top of all the learnings of APL, and that was called J. And J is the most expressive, composable language of beautifully designed language I've ever seen. Does it have object-oriented components? Does it have that kind of thing or some more? Not really, it's an array-oriented language. It's the third path. Are you saying array? Array-oriented, yeah. What does it mean to be array-oriented? So array-oriented means that you generally don't use any loops, but the whole thing is done with kind of an extreme version of broadcasting, if you're familiar with that NumPy slash Python concept. So you do a lot with one line of code. It looks a lot like math notation, highly compact. And the idea is that you can kind of, because you can do so much with one line of code, a single screen of code is very unlikely to, you very rarely need more than that to express your program. And so you can kind of keep it all in your head and you can kind of clearly communicate it. It's interesting that APL created two main branches, K and J. J is this kind of like open source niche community of crazy enthusiasts like me. And then the other path, K, was fascinating. It's an astonishingly expensive programming language which many of the world's most ludicrously rich hedge funds use. So the entire K machine is so small it sits inside level three cache on your CPU and it easily wins every benchmark I've ever seen in terms of data processing speed. But you don't come across it very much because it's like a hundred thousand dollars per CPU to run it. It's like this path of programming languages is just so much, I don't know, so much more powerful in every way than the ones that almost anybody uses every day. So it's all about computation. It's really focused on computation. It's pretty heavily focused on computation. I mean, so much of programming is data processing by definition. And so there's a lot of things you can do with it. But yeah, there's not much work being done on making like user interface toolkits or whatever. I mean, there's some, but they're not great. At the same time, you've done a lot of stuff with Perl and Python. Yeah. So where does that fit into the picture of J and K and APL? Well, you know, it's just much more pragmatic. Like in the end, you kind of have to end up where the libraries are, you know, because to me, my focus is on productivity. I just want to get stuff done and solve problems. So Perl was great. I created an email company called Fastmail. And Perl was great because back in the late 90s, early 2000s, it just had a lot of stuff it could do. I still had to write my own monitoring system and my own web framework, my own whatever, because like none of that stuff existed. But it was a super flexible language to do that in. And you used Perl for Fastmail, you used it as a backend? Like, so everything was written in Perl? Yeah. Yeah, everything, everything was Perl. Why do you think Perl hasn't succeeded or hasn't dominated the market where Python really takes over a lot of the tasks? Well, I mean, Perl did dominate. It was everything everywhere. But then the guy that ran Perl, Larry Wohl, kind of just didn't put the time in anymore. And no project can be successful if there isn't, you know, particularly one that started with a strong leader that loses that strong leadership. So then Python has kind of replaced it. You know, Python is a lot less elegant language in nearly every way. But it has the data science libraries, and a lot of them are pretty great. So I kind of use it because it's the best we have, but it's definitely not good enough. But what do you think the future of programming looks like? What do you hope the future of programming looks like? If we zoom in on the computational fields, on data science, on machine learning? I hope Swift is successful because the goal of Swift, the way Chris Latner describes it, is to be infinitely hackable. And that's what I want. I want something where me and the people I do research with and my students can look at and change everything from top to bottom. There's nothing mysterious and magical and inaccessible. Unfortunately, with Python, it's the opposite of that because Python is so slow. It's extremely unhackable. You get to a point where it's like, OK, from here on down, it's C. So your debugger doesn't work in the same way. Your profiler doesn't work in the same way. Your build system doesn't work in the same way. It's really not very hackable at all. What's the part you like to be hackable? Is it for the objective of optimizing training of neural networks, inference of neural networks? Is it performance of the system? Or is there some non-performance related just creative ideas? It's everything. In the end, I want to be productive as a practitioner. So that means that at the moment, our understanding of deep learning is incredibly primitive. There's very little we understand. Most things don't work very well, even though it works better than anything else out there. There's so many opportunities to make it better. So you look at any domain area, like speech recognition with deep learning or natural language processing classification with deep learning or whatever. Every time I look at an area with deep learning, I always see, oh, it's terrible. There's lots and lots of obviously stupid ways to do things that need to be fixed. So then I want to be able to jump in there and quickly experiment and make them better. Do you think the programming language has a role in that? Huge role, yeah. So currently, Python has a big gap in terms of our ability to innovate, particularly around recurrent neural networks and natural language processing. Because it's so slow, the actual loop where we actually loop through words, we have to do that whole thing in CUDA C. So we actually can't innovate with the kernel, the heart of that most important algorithm. And it's just a huge problem. And this happens all over the place. So we hit research limitations. Another example, convolutional neural networks, which are actually the most popular architecture for lots of things, maybe most things in deep learning. We almost certainly should be using sparse convolutional neural networks, but only two people are. Because to do it, you have to rewrite all of that CUDA C level stuff. And yeah, just researchers and practitioners don't. So there's just big gaps in what people actually research on, what people actually implement because of the programming language problem. So you think it's just too difficult to write in CUDA C that a higher level programming language like Swift should enable the easier fooling around, creative stuff with RNNs, or with sparse convolutional neural networks. Kind of. Who is at fault? Who is in charge of making it easy for a researcher to play around? I mean, no one's at fault. It's just nobody's got around to it yet. Or it's just hard. And part of the fault is that we ignored that whole APL direction, or nearly everybody did for 60 years, 50 years. But recently, people have been starting to reinvent pieces of that and create some interesting new directions in the compiler technology. So the place where that's particularly happening right now is something called MLIR, which is something that, again, Chris Latner, the Swift guy, is leading. Because it's actually not going to be Swift on its own that solves this problem. Because the problem is that currently writing an acceptably fast GPU program is too complicated, regardless of what language you use. Right. And that's just because if you have to deal with the fact that I've got 10,000 threads and I have to synchronize between them all and I have to put my thing into grid blocks and think about warps and all this stuff, it's just so much boilerplate that to do that well, you have to be a specialist at that. And it's going to be a year's work to optimize that algorithm in that way. But with things like tensor comprehensions and tile and MLIR and TVM, there's all these various projects which are all about saying, let's let people create domain-specific languages for tensor computations. These are the kinds of things we do generally on the GPU for deep learning. And then have a compiler which can optimize that tensor computation. A lot of this work is actually sitting on top of a project called Halide, which is a mind-blowing project where they came up with such a domain-specific language. In fact, two, one, domain-specific language for expressing this is what my tensor computation is. And another domain-specific language for expressing, this is the way I want you to structure the compilation of that, do it block by block and do these bits in parallel. And they were able to show how you can compress the amount of code by 10x compared to optimized GPU code and get the same performance. So these other things are sitting on top of that kind of research. And MLIR is pulling a lot of those best practices together. And now we're starting to see work done on making all of that directly accessible through Swift so that I could use Swift to write those domain-specific languages. And hopefully we'll get then Swift CUDA kernels written in a very expressive and concise way that looks a bit like J in APL. And then Swift layers on top of that, and then a Swift UI on top of that. And it'll be so nice if we can get to that point. Does it all eventually boil down to CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs? Unfortunately, at the moment it does. But one of the nice things about MLIR, if AMD ever gets their act together, which they probably won't, is that they or others could write MLIR backends for other GPUs or other tensor computation devices, of which today there are an increasing number, like Graph Core or Vertex AI or whatever. So yeah, being able to target lots of backends would be another benefit of this. And the market really needs competition, because at the moment NVIDIA is massively overcharging for their enterprise class cards, because there is no serious competition, because nobody else is doing the software properly. In the cloud, there is some competition, right? Not really, other than TPUs, perhaps. But TPUs are almost unprogrammable at the moment. So TPUs has the same problem that you can't. It's even worse. So TPUs, Google actually made an explicit decision to make them almost entirely unprogrammable, because they felt that there was too much IP in there. And if they gave people direct access to program them, people would learn their secrets. So you can't actually directly program the memory in a TPU. You can't even directly create code that runs on and that you look at on the machine that has the GPU. It all goes through a virtual machine. So all you can really do is this kind of cookie-cutter thing of like plug-in high-level stuff together, which is just super tedious and annoying and totally unnecessary. So what was the, tell me if you could, the origin story of Fast AI. What is the motivation, its mission, its dream? So I guess the founding story is heavily tied to my previous startup, which is a company called Enlytic, which was the first company to focus on deep learning for medicine. And I created that because I saw that was a huge opportunity to, there's about a 10x shortage of the number of doctors in the world, in the developing world that we need. Expected it would take about 300 years to train enough doctors to meet that gap. But I guessed that maybe if we used deep learning for some of the analytics, we could maybe make it so you don't need as highly trained doctors. Diagnosis. For diagnosis and treatment planning. Where's the biggest benefit, just before we get to Fast AI, where's the biggest benefit of AI in medicine that you see today and maybe next time? Not much happening today in terms of stuff that's actually out there. It's very early. But in terms of the opportunity, it's to take markets like India and China and Indonesia, which have big populations, Africa, small numbers of doctors, and provide diagnostic, particularly treatment planning and triage on device so that if you do a test for malaria or tuberculosis or whatever, you immediately get something that even a health care worker that's had a month of training can get a very high quality assessment of whether the patient might be at risk and tell, OK, we'll send them off to a hospital. So for example, in Africa, outside of South Africa, there's only five pediatric radiologists for the entire continent. So most countries don't have any. So if your kid is sick and they need something diagnosed through medical imaging, the person, even if you're able to get medical imaging done, the person that looks at it will be a nurse at best. But actually, in India, for example, and China, almost no x-rays are read by anybody, by any trained professional because they don't have enough. So if instead we had an algorithm that could take the most likely high risk 5% and say, triage, basically, say, OK, somebody needs to look at this, it would massively change the kind of way that what's possible with medicine in the developing world. And remember, increasingly, they have money. They're the developing world. They're not the poor world. They're the developing world. So they have the money. So they're building the hospitals. They're getting the diagnostic equipment. But there's no way for a very long time will they be able to have the expertise. Shortage of expertise. OK, and that's where the deep learning systems can step in and magnify the expertise they do have. Exactly. Yeah. So you do see, just to linger it a little bit longer, the interaction. Do you still see the human experts still at the core of these systems? Yeah, absolutely. Is there something in medicine that can be automated almost completely? I don't see the point of even thinking about that because we have such a shortage of people. Why would we want to find a way not to use them? We have people. So the idea of, even from an economic point of view, if you can make them 10x more productive, getting rid of the person doesn't impact your unit economics at all. And it totally ignores the fact that there are things people do better than machines. So it's just, to me, that's not a useful way of framing the problem. Just to clarify, I guess I meant there may be some problems where you can avoid even going to the expert ever. Maybe preventative care or some basic stuff, the low-hanging fruit, allowing the expert to focus on the things that are really that you know. Well, that's what the triage would do. So the triage would say, OK, 99% sure there's nothing here. So that can be done on device. And they can just say, OK, go home. So the experts are being used to look at the stuff which has some chance it's worth looking at, which most things is not. It's fine. Why do you think we haven't quite made progress on that yet in terms of the scale of how much AI is applied in the medical field? There's a lot of reasons. I mean, one is it's pretty new. I only started in Lelekin in 2014. And before that, it's hard to express to what degree the medical world was not aware of the opportunities here. So I went to RSNA, which is the world's largest radiology conference. And I told everybody I could, I'm doing this thing with deep learning. Please come and check it out. And no one had any idea what I was talking about. And no one had any interest in it. So we've come from absolute zero, which is hard. And then the whole regulatory framework, education system, everything is just set up to think of doctoring in a very different way. So today, there is a small number of people who are deep learning practitioners and doctors at the same time. And we're starting to see the first ones come out of their PhD programs. So Zach Kahane over in Boston, Cambridge has a number of students now who are data science experts, deep learning experts, and actual medical doctors. Quite a few doctors have completed our FAST AI course now and are publishing papers and creating journal reading groups in the American Council of Radiology. And it's just starting to happen. But it's going to be a long process. The regulators have to learn how to regulate this. They have to build guidelines. And then the lawyers at hospitals have to develop a new way of understanding that sometimes it makes sense for data to be looked at in raw form in large quantities in order to create well-changing results. Yeah, so regulation around data, all that, it sounds probably the hardest problem, but sounds reminiscent of autonomous vehicles as well. Many of the same regulatory challenges, many of the same data challenges. Yeah, I mean, funnily enough, the problem is less the regulation and more the interpretation of that regulation by lawyers in hospitals. So HIPAA was actually designed to be, and HIPAA does not stand for privacy. It stands for portability. It's actually meant to be a way that data can be used. And it was created with lots of gray areas because the idea is that would be more practical and would help people to use this legislation to actually share data in a more thoughtful way. Unfortunately, it's done the opposite because when a lawyer sees a gray area, they see, oh, if we don't know, we won't get sued, then we can't do it. So HIPAA is not exactly the problem. The problem is more that hospital lawyers are not incented to make bold decisions about data portability. Or even to embrace technology that saves lives. They more want to not get in trouble for embracing that technology. It also saves lives in a very abstract way, which is like, oh, we've been able to release these 100,000 anonymized records. I can't point at the specific person whose life that saved. I can say, oh, we ended up with this paper which found this result, which diagnosed 1,000 more people than we would have otherwise. But it's like, which ones were helped? It's very abstract. And on the conner side of that, you may be able to point to a life that was taken because of something that was. Yeah. Or a person whose privacy was violated. It's like, oh, this specific person was de-identified. So just a fascinating topic. We're jumping around. We'll get back to Fast AI. But on the question of privacy, data is the fuel for so much innovation in deep learning. What's your sense on privacy, whether we're talking about Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, just the technologies like in the medical field that rely on people's data in order to create impact? How do we get that right? Respecting people's privacy and yet creating technology that is learned from data? One of my areas of focus is on doing more with less data. So most vendors, unfortunately, are strongly incented to find ways to require more data and more computation. So Google and IBM being the most obvious. IBM. Yeah. So Watson. So Google and IBM both strongly push the idea that they have more data and more computation and more intelligent people than anybody else. And so you have to trust them to do things because nobody else can do it. And Google's very upfront about this. Jeff Dean has gone out there and given talks and said, our goal is to require 1,000 times more computation, but less people. Our goal is to use the people that you have better, and the data you have better, and the computation you have better. So one of the things that we've discovered is, or at least highlighted, is that you very, very, very often don't need much data at all. And so the data you already have in your organization will be enough to get state of the art results. So my starting point would be to say around privacy is a lot of people are looking for ways to share data and aggregate data, but I think often that's unnecessary. They assume that they need more data than they do because they're not familiar with the basics of transfer learning, which is this critical technique for needing orders of magnitude less data. Is your sense one reason you might want to collect data from everyone is like in the recommender system context, where your individual, Jeremy Howard's individual data, is the most useful for providing a product that's impactful for you. So for giving you advertisements, for recommending to you movies, for doing medical diagnosis. Is your sense we can build with a small amount of data general models that will have a huge impact for most people, that we don't need to have data from each individual? On the whole, I'd say yes. I mean, there are things like recommender systems have this cold start problem where Jeremy is a new customer. We haven't seen him before, so we can't recommend him things based on what else he's bought and liked with us. And there's various workarounds to that. A lot of music programs will start out by saying, which of these artists do you like? Which of these albums do you like? Which of these songs do you like? Netflix used to do that. Nowadays, they tend not to. People kind of don't like that because they think, oh, we don't want to bother the user. So you could work around that by having some kind of data sharing where you get my marketing record from Axiom or whatever and try to guess from that. To me, the benefit to me and to society of saving me five minutes on answering some questions versus the negative externalities of the privacy issue doesn't add up. So I think a lot of the time, the places where people are invading our privacy in order to provide convenience is really about just trying to make them more money. And they move these negative externalities into places that they don't have to pay for them. So when you actually see regulations appear that actually cause the companies that create these negative externalities to have to pay for it themselves, they say, well, we can't do it anymore. So the cost is actually too high. But for something like medicine, yeah, I mean, the hospital has my medical imaging, my pathology studies, my medical records. And also, I own my medical data. So you can, so I help a startup called Doc.ai. One of the things Doc.ai does is that it has an app. You can connect to Sutter Health and LabCorp and Walgreens and download your medical data to your phone and then upload it again at your discretion to share it as you wish. So with that kind of approach, we can share our medical information with the people we want to. Yeah, so control. I mean, really being able to control who you share with and so on. Yeah. So that has a beautiful, interesting tangent to return back to the origin story of Fast.ai. Right. So before I started Fast.ai, I spent a year researching where are the biggest opportunities for deep learning? Because I knew from my time at Kaggle in particular that deep learning had kind of hit this threshold point where it was rapidly becoming the state of the art approach in every area that looked at it. And I'd been working with neural nets for over 20 years. I knew that from a theoretical point of view, once it hit that point, it would do that in kind of just about every domain. And so I kind of spent a year researching what are the domains that's going to have the biggest low-hanging fruit in the shortest time period. I picked medicine, but there were so many I could have picked. And so there was a kind of level of frustration for me of like, OK, I'm really glad we've opened up the medical deep learning world. And today it's huge, as you know. But we can't do, you know, I can't do everything. I don't even know like, like in medicine, it took me a really long time to even get a sense of like, what kind of problems do medical practitioners solve? What kind of data do they have? Who has that data? So I kind of felt like I need to approach this differently if I want to maximize the positive impact of deep learning. Rather than me picking an area and trying to become good at it and building something, I should let people who are already domain experts in those areas and who already have the data do it themselves. So that was the reason for Fast AI, is to basically try and figure out how to get deep learning into the hands of people who could benefit from it and help them to do so in as quick and easy and effective a way as possible. Got it. So sort of empower the domain experts. Yeah. And like partly it's because like, unlike most people in this field, my background is very applied and industrial. Like my first job was at McKinsey & Company. I spent 10 years in management consulting. I spend a lot of time with domain experts. So I kind of respect them and appreciate them. And I know that's where the value generation in society is. And so I also know how most of them can't code. And most of them don't have the time to invest three years in a graduate degree or whatever. So it's like, how do I upskill those domain experts? I think that would be a super powerful thing, biggest societal impact I could have. So yeah, that was the thinking. So so much of Fast AI students and researchers and the things you teach are pragmatically minded, practically minded. Figuring out ways how to solve real problems and fast. So from your experience, what's the difference between theory and practice of deep learning? Well, most of the research in the deep learning world is a total waste of time. Right. That's what I was getting at. Yeah. It's a problem in science in general. Scientists need to be published, which means they need to work on things that their peers are extremely familiar with and can recognize in advance in that area. So that means that they all need to work on the same thing. And so it really, and the thing they work on, there's nothing to encourage them to work on things that are practically useful. So you get just a whole lot of research, which is minor advances in stuff that's been very highly studied and has no significant practical impact. Whereas the things that really make a difference, like I mentioned transfer learning. If we can be better at transfer learning, then it's this world-changing thing, where suddenly lots more people can do world-class work with less resources and less data. But almost nobody works on that. Or another example, active learning, which is the study of how do we get more out of the human beings in the loop. That's my favorite topic. Yeah. Active learning is great, but it's almost nobody working on it, because it's just not a trendy thing right now. You know what somebody's, sorry to interrupt, you're saying that nobody is publishing on active learning. But there's people inside companies, anybody who actually has to solve a problem, they're going to innovate on active learning. Yeah, everybody kind of reinvents active learning when they actually have to work in practice, because they start labeling things and they think, gosh, this is taking a long time and it's very expensive. And then they start thinking, well, why am I labeling everything? The machine's only making mistakes on those two classes. They're the hard ones. Maybe I ought to start labeling those two classes. And then you start thinking, well, why did I do that manually? Why can't I just get the system to tell me which things are going to be hardest? It's an obvious thing to do, but yeah, it's just like transfer learning. It's understudied, and the academic world just has no reason to care about practical results. The funny thing is, I've only really ever written one paper. I hate writing papers. And I didn't even write it. It was my colleague Sebastian Rutter who actually wrote it. I just did the research for it. But it was basically introducing successful transfer learning to NLP for the first time. The algorithm is called ULMfit. And I actually wrote it for the course, for the fast AI course. I wanted to teach people NLP, and I thought, I only want to teach people practical stuff. And I think the only practical stuff is transfer learning. And I couldn't find any examples of transfer learning in NLP, so I just did it. And I was shocked to find that as soon as I did it, the basic prototype took a couple of days. Smashed the state of the art on one of the most important data sets in a field that I knew nothing about. And I just thought, well, this is ridiculous. And so I spoke to Sebastian about it, and he kindly offered to write it up, the results. And so it ended up being published in ACL, which is the Top Computational Linguistics Conference. So people do actually care once you do it. But I guess it's difficult for maybe junior researchers. I don't care whether I get citations or papers or whatever. There's nothing in my life that makes that important, which is why I've never actually bothered to write a paper myself. But for people who do, I guess they have to pick the safe option, which is like, yeah, make a slight improvement on something that everybody's already working on. Yeah, nobody does anything interesting or succeeds in life with the safe option. Although, I mean, the nice thing is nowadays, everybody is now working on NLP transfer learning. Because since that time, we've had GPT and GPT-2 and BERT. And it's like, it's so, yeah, once you show that something's possible, everybody jumps in, I guess. I hope to be a part of it, and I hope to see more innovation and active learning in the same way. I think transfer learning and active learning are fascinating. Public open work. I actually helped start a startup called Platform AI, which is really all about active learning. And yeah, it's been interesting trying to see what research is out there and make the most of it. And there's basically none, so we've had to do all our own research. Once again, and just as you described, can you tell the story of the Stanford competition Dawnbench and Fast AI's achievement on it? Sure. So something which I really enjoy is that I basically teach two courses a year, the Practical Deep Learning for Coders, which is the introductory course, and then Cutting Edge Deep Learning for Coders, which is the research level course. And while I teach those courses, I basically have a big office at the University of San Francisco. It would be enough for 30 people. And I invite anybody, any student who wants to come and hang out with me while I build the course. And so generally, it's full. And so we have 20 or 30 people in a big office with nothing to do but study deep learning. So it was during one of these times that somebody in the group said, oh, there's a thing called Dawnbench that looks interesting. And I was like, what the hell is that? I'm going to set out some competition to see how quickly you can train a model. Seems kind of not exactly relevant to what we're doing, but it sounds like the kind of thing which you might be interested in. And I checked it out, and I was like, oh, crap. There's only 10 days till it's over. It's pretty much too late. And we're kind of busy trying to teach this course. But we're like, oh, it would make an interesting case study for the course. Like, it's all the stuff we're already doing. Why don't we just put together our current best practices and ideas? So me and I guess about four students just decided to give it a go. And we focused on this small one called Cipher 10, which is little 32 by 32 pixel images. Can you say what downbench is? Yeah, so it's a competition to train a model as fast as possible. It was run by Stanford. And it's cheap as possible, too. That's also another one for as cheap as possible. And there was a couple of categories, ImageNet and Cipher 10. So ImageNet's this big 1.3 million image thing that took a couple of days to train. Remember a friend of mine, Pete Warden, who's now at Google. I remember he told me how he trained ImageNet a few years ago when he basically had this little granny flat out the back that he turned into his ImageNet training center. And after a year of work, he figured out how to train it in 10 days or something. That was a big job. Well, Cipher 10, at that time, you could train in a few hours. It was much smaller and easier. So we thought we'd try Cipher 10. And yeah, I've really never done that before. Things like using more than one GPU at a time was something I tried to avoid because to me, it's very against the whole idea of accessibility is you better do things with one GPU. Have you asked in the past before, after having accomplished something, how do I do this faster, much faster? Always. But for me, it's always how do I make it much faster on a single GPU that a normal person could afford in their day-to-day life? It's not how could I do it faster by having a huge data center? Because to me, it's all about as many people should be able to use something as possible without fussing around with infrastructure. So anyway, so in this case, it's like, well, we can use eight GPUs just by renting an AWS machine. So we thought we'd try that. And yeah, basically, using the stuff we were already doing, we were able to get the speed. Within a few days, we had the speed down to, I don't know, a very small number of minutes. I can't remember exactly how many minutes it was, but it might have been like 10 minutes or something. And so yeah, we found ourselves at the top of the leaderboard easily for both time and money, which really shocked me because the other people competing in this were like Google and Intel and stuff who I know a lot more about this stuff than I think we do. So then we emboldened. We thought, let's try the ImageNet one, too. I mean, it seemed way out of our league. But our goal was to get under 12 hours. And we did, which was really exciting. But we didn't put anything up on the leaderboard. But we were down to like 10 hours. But then Google put in like five hours or something. And we were just like, oh, we're so screwed. But we kind of thought, we'll keep trying. If Google can do it in five. I mean, Google did it on five hours on like a TPU pod or something, like a lot of hardware. But we kind of had a bunch of ideas to try. Like a really simple thing was, why are we using these big images? They're like 224, 256 by 256 pixels. Why don't we try smaller ones? And just to elaborate, there's a constraint on the accuracy that your trained model is supposed to achieve. Yeah, you've got to achieve 93%, I think it was, for ImageNet. Exactly. Which is very tough. So you have to. Yeah, 93%. Like they picked a good threshold. It was a little bit higher than what the most commonly used ResNet-50 model could achieve at that time. So yeah, so it's quite a difficult problem to solve. But yeah, we realized if we actually just use 64 by 64 images, it trained a pretty good model. And then we could take that same model and just give it a couple of epochs to learn 224 by 224 images. And it was basically already trained. It makes a lot of sense. Like if you teach somebody, like here's what a dog looks like, and you show them low res versions, and then you say, here's a really clear picture of a dog, they already know what a dog looks like. So that like just, we jumped to the front. And we ended up winning parts of that competition. We actually ended up doing a distributed version over multiple machines a couple of months later, and ended up at the top of the leaderboard. We had 18 minutes. ImageNet. Yeah. And people have just kept on blasting through again and again since then. So what's your view on multi-GPU or multiple machine training in general as a way to speed code up? I think it's largely a waste of time. Both multi-GPU on a single machine and? Yeah, particularly multi-machines, because it's just clunky. Multi-GPUs is less clunky than it used to be. But to me, anything that slows down your iteration speed is a waste of time. So you could maybe do your very last perfecting of the model on multi-GPUs if you need to. So for example, I think doing stuff on ImageNet is generally a waste of time. Why test things on 1.3 million images? Most of us don't use 1.3 million images. And we've also done research that shows that doing things on a smaller subset of images gives you the same relative answers anyway. So from a research point of view, why waste that time? So actually, I released a couple of new data sets recently. One is called ImageNet, the French ImageNet, which is a small subset of ImageNet, which is designed to be easy to classify. What's how do you spell ImageNet? It's got an extra T and E at the end, because it's very French. Image, OK. Yeah. And then another one called ImageWolf, which is a subset of ImageNet that only contains dog breeds. And that's a hard one, right? That's a hard one. And I've discovered that if you just look at these two subsets, you can train things on a single GPU in 10 minutes. And the results you get are directly transferable to ImageNet nearly all the time. And so now I'm starting to see some researchers start to use these much smaller data sets. I so deeply love the way you think, because I think you might have written a blog post saying that sort of going to these big data sets is encouraging people to not think creatively. Absolutely. So it sort of constrains you to train on large resources. And because you have these resources, you think more research will be better. And then you start. So somehow you kill the creativity. Yeah, and even worse than that, Lex, I keep hearing from people who say, I decided not to get into deep learning, because I don't believe it's accessible to people outside of Google to do useful work. So I see a lot of people make an explicit decision to not learn this incredibly valuable tool, because they've drunk the Google Kool-Aid, which is that only Google's big enough and smart enough to do it. And I just find that so disappointing, and it's so wrong. And I think all the major breakthroughs in AI in the next 20 years will be doable on a single GPU. I would say my sense is all the big sort of even. Well, let's put it this way. None of the big breakthroughs of the last 20 years required multiple GPUs. So like BatchNorm, Rally-U, Dropout, Cognizant in general. Every one of them, none of them has required multiple GPUs. The original GANs didn't require multiple GPUs. Well, and we've actually recently shown that you don't even need GANs. So we've developed GAN-level outcomes without needing GANs. And we can now do it with, again, by using transfer learning, we can do it in a couple of hours on a single GPU. Just using a generator model without the adversarial part? Yeah. So we've found loss functions that work super well without the adversarial part. And then one of our students, a guy called Jason Antich, has created a system called De-Altify, which uses this technique to colorize all black and white movies. You can do it on a single GPU, colorize a whole movie in a couple of hours. And one of the things that Jason and I did together was we figured out how to add a little bit of GAN at the very end, which it turns out for colorization makes it just a bit brighter and nicer. And then Jason did masses of experiments to figure out exactly how much to do. But it's still all done on his home machine, on a single GPU in his lounge room. And if you think about colorizing Hollywood movies, that sounds like something a huge studio would have to do. But he has the world's best results on this. There's this problem of microphones. We're just talking to microphones now. It's such a pain in the ass to have these microphones to get good quality audio. And I tried to see if it's possible to plop down a bunch of cheap sensors and reconstruct higher quality audio from multiple sources. Because right now I haven't seen work from, okay, we can save inexpensive mics, automatically combining audio from multiple sources to improve the combined audio. People haven't done that. And that feels like a learning problem. So hopefully somebody can. Well, I mean, it's eminently doable and it should have been done by now. I felt the same way about computational photography four years ago. That's right. Why are we investing in big lenses when three cheap lenses plus actually a little bit of intentional movement, so like take a few frames, gives you enough information to get excellent subpixel resolution, which particularly with deep learning, you would know exactly what you meant to be looking at. We can totally do the same thing with audio. I think it's a madness that hasn't been done yet. Is there been progress on photography companies? Yeah, photography is basically a standard now. So the Google Pixel Night Light, I don't know if you've ever tried it, but it's astonishing. You take a picture in almost pitch black and you get back a very high quality image. And it's not because of the lens. Same stuff with like adding the bokeh to the background blurring. It's done computationally. Just the pixel right here. Yeah, basically everybody now is doing most of the fanciest stuff on their phones with computational photography. And also increasingly people are putting more than one lens on the back of the camera. So the same will happen for audio for sure. And there's applications in the audio side. If you look at an Alexa type device, most people I've seen, especially I worked at Google before, when you look at noise background removal, you don't think of multiple sources of audio. You don't play with that as much as I would hope people would. But I mean, you can still do it even with one. Like again, it's not much work's been done in this area. So we're actually gonna be releasing an audio library soon, which hopefully will encourage development of this because it's so underused. The basic approach we used for our super resolution in which Jason uses for De-Altify of generating high quality images, the exact same approach would work for audio. No one's done it yet, but it would be a couple of months work. Okay, also learning rate in terms of Dawnbench. There's some magic on learning rate that you played around with. That's kind of interesting. Yeah, so this is all work that came from a guy called Leslie Smith. Leslie's a researcher who like us cares a lot about just the practicalities of training neural networks quickly and accurately, which you would think is what everybody should care about, but almost nobody does. And he discovered something very interesting, which he calls super convergence, which is there are certain networks that with certain settings of high parameters could suddenly be trained 10 times faster by using a 10 times higher learning rate. Now, no one published that paper because it's not an area of kind of active research in the academic world. No academics recognize this is important. And also deep learning in academia is not considered a experimental science. So unlike in physics where you could say like, I just saw a subatomic particle do something which the theory doesn't explain. You could publish that without an explanation. And then the next 60 years, people can try to work out how to explain it. We don't allow this in the deep learning world. So it's literally impossible for Leslie to publish a paper that says, I've just seen something amazing happen. This thing trained 10 times faster than it should have. I don't know why. And so the reviewers were like, we can't publish that because you don't know why. So anyway. That's important to pause on because there's so many discoveries that would need to start like that. Every other scientific field I know of works that way. I don't know why ours is uniquely disinterested in publishing unexplained experimental results, but there it is. So it wasn't published. Having said that, I read a lot more unpublished papers than published papers because that's where you find the interesting insights. So I absolutely read this paper. And I was just like, this is astonishingly mind blowing and weird and awesome. And like, why isn't everybody only talking about this? Because like, if you can train these things 10 times faster, they also generalize better because you're doing less epochs, which means you look at the data less, you get better accuracy. So I've been kind of studying that ever since. And eventually Leslie kind of figured out a lot of how to get this done. And we added minor tweaks. And a big part of the trick is starting at a very low learning rate, very gradually increasing it. So as you're training your model, you would take very small steps. You would take very small steps at the start and you gradually make them bigger and bigger until eventually you're taking much bigger steps than anybody thought was possible. There's a few other little tricks to make it work, but basically we can reliably get super convergence. And so for the Dawnbench thing, we were using just much higher learning rates than people expected to work. What do you think the future of, I mean, it makes so much sense for that to be a critical hyperparameter learning rate that you vary. What do you think the future of learning rate magic looks like? Well, there's been a lot of great work in the last 12 months in this area. And people are increasingly realizing that optimize, like we just have no idea really how optimizers work. And the combination of weight decay, which is how we regularize optimizers and the learning rate, and then other things like the Epsilon we use in the Atom optimizer, they all work together in weird ways. And different parts of the model, this is another thing we've done a lot of work on is research into how different parts of the model should be trained at different rates in different ways. So we do something we call discriminative learning rates, which is really important, particularly for transfer learning. So really I think in the last 12 months, a lot of people have realized that all this stuff is important. There's been a lot of great work coming out and we're starting to see algorithms appear, which have very, very few dials, if any, that you have to touch. So I think what's gonna happen is the idea of a learning rate, it almost already has disappeared in the latest research. And instead it's just like, we know enough about how to interpret the gradients and the change of gradients we see to know how to set every parameter. They can automate it. So you see the future of deep learning where really, where's the input of a human expert needed? Well, hopefully the input of the human expert will be almost entirely unneeded from the deep learning point of view. So again, like Google's approach to this is to try and use thousands of times more compute to run lots and lots of models at the same time and hope that one of them is good. That all male kind of stuff, which I think is insane. When you better understand the mechanics of how models learn, you don't have to try a thousand different models to find which one happens to work the best. You can just jump straight to the best one, which means that it's more accessible in terms of compute, cheaper. And also with less hyperparameters to set, it means you don't need deep learning experts to train your deep learning model for you, which means that domain experts can do more of the work, which means that now you can focus the human time on the kind of interpretation, data gathering, identifying model errors and stuff like that. Yeah, the data side. How often do you work with data these days in terms of the cleaning, looking at it? Like Darwin looked at different species while traveling about. Do you look at data? I have you in your roots in Kaggle. Always, yeah. Look at data. I mean, it's a key part of our course is like before we train a model in the course, we see how to look at the data. And then after the first thing we do after we train our first model, which we fine tune an ImageNet model for five minutes. And then the thing we immediately do after that is we learn how to analyze the results of the model by looking at examples of misclassified images and looking at a classification matrix and then doing like research on Google to learn about the kinds of things that it's misclassifying. So to me, one of the really cool things about machine learning models in general is that when you interpret them, they tell you about things like what are the most important features, which groups you're misclassifying, and they help you become a domain expert more quickly because you can focus your time on the bits that the model is telling you is important. So it lets you deal with things like data leakage. For example, if it says, oh, the main feature I'm looking at is customer ID, and you're like, oh, customer ID should be predictive. And then you can talk to the people that manage customer IDs and they'll tell you like, oh, yes, as soon as a customer's application is accepted, we add a one on the end of their customer ID or something. So yeah, looking at data, particularly from the lens of which parts of the data the model says is important is super important. Yeah, and using the model to almost debug the data to learn more about the data. Exactly. What are the different cloud options for training your networks? Last question related to DawnBench. Well, it's part of a lot of the work you do, but from a perspective of performance, I think you've written this in a blog post. There's AWS, there's TPU from Google. What's your sense, what the future holds? What would you recommend now in terms of training the cloud? So from a hardware point of view, Google's TPUs and the best Nvidia GPUs are similar. Maybe the TPUs are like 30% faster, but they're also much harder to program. There isn't a clear leader in terms of hardware right now, although much more importantly, the Nvidia GPUs are much more programmable. They've got much more written for them. So like that's the clear leader for me and where I would spend my time as a researcher and practitioner. But then in terms of the platform, I mean, we're super lucky now with stuff like Google GCP, Google Cloud and AWS that you can access a GPU pretty quickly and easily. But I mean, for AWS, it's still too hard. Like you have to find an AMI and get the instance running and then install the software you want and blah, blah, blah. GCP is currently the best way to get started on a full server environment because they have a fantastic fast AI in PyTorch, ready to go instance, which has all the courses pre-installed. It has Jupyter Notebook pre-running. Jupyter Notebook is this wonderful interactive computing system, which everybody basically should be using for any kind of data-driven research. But then even better than that, there are platforms like Salamander, which we own, and PaperSpace, where literally you click a single button and it pops up a Jupyter Notebook straight away without any kind of installation or anything and all the course notebooks are all pre-installed. So like for me, this is one of the things we spent a lot of time kind of curating and working on. Because when we first started our courses, the biggest problem was people dropped out of lesson one because they couldn't get an AWS instance running. So things are so much better now. And like we actually have, if you go to course.fast.ai, the first thing it says is, here's how to get started with your GPU. And it's like, you just click on the link and you click start and you're going. You will go GCP. I have to confess, I've never used the Google GCP. Yeah, GCP gives you $300 of compute for free, which is really nice. But as I say, Salamander and PaperSpace are even easier still. Okay. So from the perspective of deep learning frameworks, you work with Fast.ai, if you go to this framework, and PyTorch and TensorFlow. What are the strengths of each platform, in your perspective? So in terms of what we've done our research on and taught in our course, we started with Theano and Keras, and then we switched to TensorFlow and Keras, and then we switched to PyTorch, and then we switched to PyTorch and Fast.ai. And that kind of reflects a growth and development of the ecosystem of deep learning libraries. Theano and TensorFlow were great, but were much harder to teach and to do research and development on because they define what's called a computational graph upfront, a static graph, where you basically have to say, here are all the things that I'm gonna eventually do in my model, and then later on you say, okay, do those things with this data, and you can't debug them, you can't do them step by step, you can't program them interactively in a Jupyter notebook and so forth. PyTorch was not the first, but PyTorch was certainly the strongest entrant to come along and say, let's not do it that way, let's just use normal Python. And everything you know about in Python is just gonna work, and we'll figure out how to make that run on the GPU as and when necessary. That turned out to be a huge leap in terms of what we could do with our research and what we could do with our teaching. Because it wasn't limiting. Yeah, I mean, it was critical for us for something like Dawnbench to be able to rapidly try things. It's just so much harder to be a researcher and practitioner when you have to do everything up front and you can't inspect it. Problem with PyTorch is it's not at all accessible to newcomers because you have to write your own training loop and manage the gradients and all this stuff. And it's also not great for researchers because you're spending your time dealing with all this boilerplate and overhead rather than thinking about your algorithm. So we ended up writing this very multi-layered API that at the top level, you can train a state-of-the-art neural network in three lines of code. And which kind of talks to an API, which talks to an API, which talks to an API, which like you can dive into at any level and get progressively closer to the machine kind of levels of control. And this is the Fast.ai library. That's been critical for us and for our students and for lots of people that have won big learning competitions with it and written academic papers with it. It's made a big difference. We're still limited though by Python. And particularly this problem with things like recurrent neural nets say where you just can't change things unless you accept it going so slowly that it's impractical. So in the latest incarnation of the course and with some of the research we're now starting to do, we're starting to do some stuff in Swift. I think we're three years away from that being super practical, but I'm in no hurry. I'm very happy to invest the time to get there. But with that, we actually already have a nascent version of the Fast.ai library for vision running on Swift on TensorFlow because Python for TensorFlow is not going to cut it. It's just a disaster. What they did was they tried to replicate the bits that people were saying they like about PyTorch, this kind of interactive computation, but they didn't actually change their foundational runtime components. So they kind of added this like syntax sugar they call TF eager, TensorFlow eager, which makes it look a lot like PyTorch, but it's 10 times slower than PyTorch to actually do a step. So because they didn't invest the time in retooling the foundations because their code base is so horribly complex. Yeah, I think it's probably very difficult to do that kind of rejoin. Yeah, well, particularly the way TensorFlow was written, it was written by a lot of people very quickly in a very disorganized way. So when you actually look in the code, as I do often, I'm always just like, oh, God, what were they thinking? It's just pretty awful. So I'm really extremely negative about the potential future for Python, TensorFlow. But Swift for TensorFlow can be a different beast altogether. It can be like, it can basically be a layer on top of MLIR that takes advantage of all the great compiler stuff that Swift builds on with LLVM. And yeah, I think it will be absolutely fantastic. Well, you're inspiring me to try. Evan truly felt the pain of TensorFlow 2.0 Python. It's fine by me. But... Yeah, I mean, it does the job if you're using like predefined things that somebody's already written. But if you actually compare, you know, like I've had to do, because I've been having to do a lot of stuff with TensorFlow recently, you actually compare like, okay, I want to write something from scratch. And you're like, I just keep finding things like, oh, it's running 10 times slower than PyTorch. So is the biggest cost, let's throw running time out the window. How long it takes you to program. That's not too different now. Thanks to TensorFlow eager, that's not too different. But because so many things take so long to run, you wouldn't run it at 10 times slower. Like you just go like, oh, this is taking too long. And also there's a lot of things which are just less programmable like tf.data, which is the way data processing works in TensorFlow is just this big mess. It's incredibly inefficient. And they kind of had to write it that way because of the TPU problems I described earlier. So I just, you know, I just feel like they've got this huge technical debt which they're not going to solve without starting from scratch. So here's an interesting question then. If there's a new student starting today, what would you recommend they use? Well, I mean, we obviously recommend fast AI and PyTorch because we teach new students and that's what we teach with. So we would very strongly recommend that because it will let you get on top of the concepts much more quickly. So then you'll become an actual, and you'll also learn the actual state of the art techniques, you know, so you actually get world-class results. Honestly, it doesn't much matter what library you learn because switching from Chainer to MXNet to TensorFlow to PyTorch is going to be a couple of days work, as long as you understand the foundations well. But you think, will Swift creep in there as a thing that people start using? Not for a few years, particularly because Swift has no data science community, libraries, schooling. And the Swift community has a total lack of appreciation and understanding of numeric computing. So they keep on making stupid decisions. For years, they've just done dumb things around performance and prioritization. That's clearly changing now because the developer of Swift, Chris Latner, is working at Google on Swift for TensorFlow. So that's a priority. It'll be interesting to see what happens with Apple because Apple hasn't shown any sign of caring about numeric programming in Swift. So hopefully they'll get off their ass and start appreciating this because currently all of their low-level libraries are not written in Swift. They're not particularly Swifty at all. Stuff like CoreML, they're really pretty rubbish. So yeah, so there's a long way to go. But at least one nice thing is that Swift for TensorFlow can actually directly use Python code and Python libraries in literally the entire Lesson 1 notebook of Fast AI runs in Swift right now in Python mode. So that's a nice intermediate thing. How long does it take, if you look at the two Fast AI courses, how long does it take to get from point zero to completing both courses? It varies a lot, somewhere between two months and two years generally. So for two months, how many hours a day on average? So somebody who is a very competent coder can do 70 hours per course and pick up 70. 70, 70, that's it? Okay. But a lot of people I know take a year off to study Fast AI full-time and say at the end of the year they feel pretty competent because generally there's a lot of other things you do. Like generally they'll be entering Kaggle competitions. They might be reading Ian Goodfellow's book. They'll be doing a bunch of stuff. And often, particularly if they are a domain expert, their coding skills might be a little on the pedestrian side. So part of it is just like doing a lot more writing. What do you find is the bottleneck for people usually, except getting started and setting stuff up? I would say coding. Yeah, I would say the people who are strong coders pick it up the best. Although another bottleneck is people who have a lot of experience of classic statistics can really struggle because the intuition is so the opposite of what they're used to. They're very used to trying to reduce the number of parameters in their model and looking at individual coefficients and stuff like that. So I find people who have a lot of coding background and know nothing about statistics are generally going to be the best off. So you taught several courses on deep learning and it's fine. And Simon says the best way to understand something is to teach it. What have you learned about deep learning from teaching it? A lot. It's a key reason for me to teach the courses. I mean, obviously it's going to be necessary to achieve our goal of getting domain experts to be familiar with deep learning. But it was also necessary for me to achieve my goal of being really familiar with deep learning. I mean, to see so many domain experts from so many different backgrounds, it's definitely, I wouldn't say taught me, but convinced me something that I like to believe was true, which was anyone can do it. So there's a lot of snobbishness out there about only certain people can learn to code, only certain people are going to be smart enough to do AI. That's definitely bullshit. I've seen so many people from so many different backgrounds get state of the art results in their domain areas now. It's definitely taught me that the key differentiator between people that succeed and people that fail is tenacity. That seems to be basically the only thing that matters. A lot of people give up. But of the ones who don't give up, pretty much everybody succeeds. Even if at first I'm just kind of like thinking like, wow, they really aren't quite getting it yet, are they? But eventually people get it and they succeed. So I think that's been, I think they're both things I've liked to believe was true, but I don't feel like I really had strong evidence for them to be true. But now I can say I've seen it again and again. So what advice do you have for someone who wants to get started in deep learning? Train lots of models. That's how you learn it. So I think, it's not just me, I think our course is very good, but also lots of people independently have said it's very good. It recently won the COGX Award for AI courses as being the best in the world. So I'd say come to our course, course.fast.ai. And the thing I keep on hopping on in my lessons is train models, print out the inputs to the models, print out to the outputs to the models, like study, change the inputs a bit, look at how the outputs vary, just run lots of experiments to get an intuitive understanding of what's going on. To get hooked, do you think you mentioned training, do you think just running the models inference? If we talk about getting started. No, you've got to fine tune the models. So that's the critical thing, because at that point you now have a model that's in your domain area. So there's no point running somebody else's model because it's not your model. So it only takes five minutes to fine tune a model for the data you care about. And in lesson two of the course, we teach you how to create your own data set from scratch by scripting Google Image Search. So we show you how to actually create a web application running online. So I create one in the course that differentiates between a teddy bear, a grizzly bear and a brown bear. And it does it with basically 100% accuracy. It took me about four minutes to scrape the images from Google Search from the script. There's little graphical widgets we have in the notebook that help you clean up the data set. There's other widgets that help you study the results to see where the errors are happening. And so now we've got over a thousand replies in our share your work here thread of students saying, here's the thing I built. And so there's people who like and a lot of them are state of the art. Like somebody said, oh, I tried looking at Devangari characters and I couldn't believe it. The thing that came out was more accurate than the best academic paper after lesson one. And then there's others which are just more kind of fun, like somebody who's doing Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds. She said that's kind of their national bird. And she's got something that can now classify Trinidad and Tobago hummingbirds. So yeah, train models, fine tune models with your data set and then study their inputs and outputs. How much is Fast.AI courses? Free. Everything we do is free. We have no revenue sources of any kind. It's just a service to the community. You're a saint. OK. Once a person understands the basics, trains a bunch of models. If we look at the scale of years, what advice do you have for someone wanting to eventually become an expert? Train lots of models. Specifically, train lots of models in your domain area. So an expert what? Right. We don't need more expert like create slightly evolutionary research in areas that everybody's studying. We need experts at using deep learning to diagnose malaria. Or we need experts at using deep learning to analyze language to study media bias. So we need experts in analyzing fisheries to identify problem areas and the ocean. That's what we need. So become the expert in your passion area. And this is a tool which you can use for just about anything. And you'll be able to do that thing better than other people, particularly by combining it with your passion and domain expertise. So that's really interesting. Even if you do want to innovate on transfer learning or active learning, your thought is, I mean, it's one I certainly share, is you also need to find a domain or data set that you actually really care for. Right. If you're not working on a real problem that you understand, how do you know if you're doing it any good? You know, how do you know if your results are good? How do you know if you're getting bad results? Why are you getting bad results? Is it a problem with the data? Like, how do you know you're doing anything useful? Yeah, the only, to me, the only really interesting research is not the only, but the vast majority of interesting research is like, try and solve an actual problem and solve it really well. So both understanding sufficient tools on the deep learning side and becoming a domain expert in a particular domain are really things within reach for anybody. I mean, to me, I would compare it to like studying self-driving cars, having never looked at a car or been in a car or turned a car on, you know, which is like the way it is for a lot of people. They'll study some academic data set where they literally have no idea about that. By the way, I'm not sure how familiar you are with autonomous vehicles, but that is literally, you describe a large percentage of robotics folks working in self-driving cars is they actually haven't considered driving. They haven't actually looked at what driving looks like. They haven't driven. And it's a problem because you know, when you've actually driven, you know, like these are the things that happened to me when I was driving. There's nothing that beats the real world examples of just experiencing them. You've created many successful startups. What does it take to create a successful startup? Same thing as becoming successful deep learning practitioner, which is not giving up. So you can run out of money or run out of time or run out of something, you know, but if you keep costs super low and try and save up some money beforehand. So you can afford to have some time. Then just sticking with it is one important thing. Doing something you understand and care about is important. By something, I don't mean the biggest problem I see with deep learning people is they do a PhD in deep learning and then they try and commercialize their PhD. It is a waste of time because that doesn't solve an actual problem. You picked your PhD topic because it was an interesting kind of engineering or math or research exercise. But yeah, if you've actually spent time as a recruiter and you know that most of your time was spent sifting through resumes and you know that most of the time you're just looking for certain kinds of things and you can try doing that with a model for a few minutes and see whether that's something which the model seems to be able to do as well as you could. Then you're on the right track to creating a startup. And then I think just being pragmatic and try and stay away from venture capital money as long as possible, preferably forever. So yeah, on that point, did you, venture capital, were you able to successfully run startups with self-funded? Yeah, so my first two were self-funded and that was the right way to do it. Is that scary? No, VC startups are much more scary because you have these people on your back who do this all the time and who have done it for years telling you grow, grow, grow, grow. They don't care if you fail. They only care if you don't grow fast enough. So that's scary. Whereas doing the ones myself with partners who were friends is nice because we just went along at a pace that made sense and we were able to build it to something which was big enough that we never had to work again, but was not big enough that any VC would think it was impressive and that was enough for us to be excited. So I thought that's a much better way to do things for most people. In generally speaking, not for yourself, but how do you make money during that process? Do you cut into savings? So yeah, so I started Fast Mail and Optimal Decisions at the same time in 1999 with two different friends. And for Fast Mail, I guess I spent $70 a month on the server. And when the server ran out of space, I put a payments button on the front page and said, if you want more than 10 megs of space, you have to pay $10 a year. So run low, like keep your costs down. So I kept my costs down and once I needed to spend more money, I asked people to spend the money for me and that was that basically from then on we were making money and I was profitable from then. For Optimal Decisions, it was a bit harder because we were trying to sell something that was more like a $1 million sale, but what we did was we would sell scoping projects, so kind of like prototypey projects, but rather than doing it for free, we would sell them $50,000 to $100,000. So again, we were covering our costs and also making the client feel like we were doing something valuable. In both cases, we were profitable from six months in. Nevertheless, it's scary. I mean, yeah, sure. I mean, it's scary before you jump in and I guess I was comparing it to the scarediness of VC. I felt like with VC stuff, it was more scary, kind of much more in somebody else's hands. Will they fund you or not? And what do they think of what you're doing? It's very difficult with VCs, backed startups to actually do the thing which I thought was important for the company rather than doing the thing which I thought would make the VC happy. Now, VCs always tell you not to do the thing that makes them happy, but then if you don't do the thing that makes them happy, they get sad. And do you think optimizing for the whatever they call it, the exit, is a good thing to optimize for? I mean, it can be, but not at the VC level because the VC exit needs to be a thousand X. So where else the lifestyle exit if you can sell something for $10 million and you've made it, right? So it depends. If you want to build something that's going to be kind of happy to do forever, then fine. If you want to build something, you want to sell in three years time, that's fine too. I mean, they're both perfectly good outcomes. So you're learning Swift now in a way. I mean, you already are too. And I read that you use at least in some cases, space repetition as a mechanism for learning new things. I use Enki quite a lot myself. I actually don't never talk to anybody about it. Don't know how many people do it, but it works incredibly well for me. Can you talk to your experience? Like how did you, what do you, first of all, okay, let's back it up. What is space repetition? So space repetition is an idea created by a psychologist named Ebbinghaus. I don't know, must be a couple of hundred years ago or something, 150 years ago. He did something which sounds pretty damn tedious. He wrote down random sequences of letters on cards and tested how well he would remember those random sequences a day later, a week later, whatever. He discovered that there was this kind of curve where his probability of remembering one of them would be dramatically smaller the next day and then a little bit smaller the next day, a little bit smaller the next day. What he discovered is that if he revised those cards after a day, the probabilities would decrease at a smaller rate. And then if you revise them again a week later, they would decrease at a smaller rate again. And so he basically figured out a roughly optimal equation for when you should revise something you want to remember. So space repetition learning is using this simple algorithm, which is something like revise something after a day and then three days and then a week and then three weeks and so forth. And so if you use a program like Anki, as you know, it will just do that for you. And if you, and it will say, did you remember this? And if you say no, it will reschedule it back to be appear again like 10 times faster than it otherwise would have. It's a kind of a way of being guaranteed to learn something because by definition, if you're not learning it, it will be rescheduled to be revised more quickly. Unfortunately, though, it's also like it doesn't let you fool yourself if you're not learning something you know, like your revisions will just get more and more. So you have to find ways to learn things productively and effectively like treat your brain well. So using like mnemonics and stories and context and stuff like that. So, yeah, it's a super great technique. It's like learning how to learn is something which everybody should learn before they actually learn anything. But almost nobody does. So what have you, so it certainly works well for learning new languages for, I mean, for learning like small projects almost. But do you, you know, I started using it for, I forget who wrote a blog post about this inspired me. It might have been you, I'm not sure. I started when I read papers, concepts and ideas, I'll put them. Was it Michael Nielsen? It might, yeah. So Michael's been, Michael started doing this recently and has been writing about it. I, so the kind of today's Ebbinghaus is a guy called Peter Wozniak who developed a system called SuperMemo. And he's been basically trying to become like the world's greatest Renaissance man over the last few decades. He's basically lived his life with spaced repetition learning for everything. I, and so like Michael's only very recently got into this, but he started really getting excited about doing it for a lot of different things. For me personally, I actually don't use it for anything except Chinese. And the reason for that is that Chinese is specifically a thing I made a conscious decision that I want to continue to remember. Even if I don't get much of a chance to exercise it, because like I'm not often in China, so I don't. Or else something like programming languages or papers, I have a very different approach, which is I try not to learn anything from them, but instead I try to identify the important concepts and like actually ingest them. So like really understand that concept deeply and study it carefully. Well, decide if it really is important, if it is like incorporated into our library, you know, incorporated into how I do things or decide it's not worth it. So I find I then remember the things that I care about because I'm using it all the time. So for the last 25 years, I've committed to spending at least half of every day learning or practicing something new, which is all my colleagues have always hated because it always looks like I'm not working on what I'm meant to be working on. But it always means I do everything faster because I've been practicing a lot of stuff. So I kind of give myself a lot of opportunity to practice new things. And so I find now I don't. Yeah, I don't often kind of find myself wishing I could remember something, because if it's something that's useful, then I've been using it a lot. It's easy enough to look it up on Google. But speaking Chinese, you can't look it up on Google. Do you have advice for people learning new things? So if you what have you learned as a process? I mean, it all starts just making the hours in the day available. Yeah, you got to stick with it, which is, again, the number one thing that 99% of people don't do. So the people I started learning Chinese with, none of them were still doing it 12 months later. I'm still doing it 10 years later. I tried to stay in touch with them, but they just no one did it. For something like Chinese, like study how human learning works. So every one of my Chinese flashcards is associated with a story, and that story is specifically designed to be memorable. And we find things memorable, which are like funny or disgusting or sexy or related to people that we know or care about. So I try to make sure all the stories that are in my head have those characteristics. Yeah, so you won't remember things well if they don't have some context. And yeah, you won't remember them well if you don't regularly practice them, whether it be just part of your day-to-day life or for Chinese, for me, flashcards. I mean, the other thing is, let yourself fail sometimes. So like I've had various medical problems over the last few years, and basically my flashcards just stopped for about three years. And then there have been other times I've stopped for a few months, and it's so hard because you get back to it, and it's like you have 18,000 cards due. And so you just have to go, all right, well, I can either stop and give up everything or just decide to do this every day for the next two years until I get back to it. The amazing thing has been that even after three years, the Chinese were still in there. Like it was so much faster to relearn than it was to learn the first time. Yeah, absolutely. It's in there. I have the same with guitar, with music and so on. It's sad because work sometimes takes away and then you won't play for a year. But really, if you then just get back to it every day, you're right there again. What do you think is the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence? What are your hopes in deep learning or beyond that people should be working on or you hope there'll be breakthroughs? I don't think it's possible to predict. I think what we already have is an incredibly powerful platform to solve lots of societally important problems that are currently unsolved. So I just hope that lots of people will learn this toolkit and try to use it. I don't think we need a lot of new technological breakthroughs to do a lot of great work right now. And when do you think we're going to create a human level intelligence system? I don't know. How hard is it? How far away are we? I don't know. I have no way to know. I don't know why people make predictions about this because there's no data and nothing to go on. And it's just like there's so many societally important problems to solve right now. I just don't find it a really interesting question to even answer. So in terms of societally important problems, what's the problem that is within reach? Well, I mean, for example, there are problems that AI creates. So most specifically, labor force displacement is going to be huge and people keep making this frivolous econometric argument of being like, oh, there's been other things that aren't AI that have come along before and haven't created massive labor force displacement. Therefore, AI won't. So that's a serious concern for you? Oh, yeah. Andrew Yang is running on it. Yeah, I'm desperately concerned. And you see already that the changing workplace has led to a hollowing out of the middle class. You're seeing that students coming out of school today have a less rosy financial future ahead of them than their parents did, which has never happened in the last few hundred years. You know, we've always had progress before. And you see this turning into anxiety and despair and even violence. So I very much worry about that. You've written quite a bit about ethics too. I do think that every data scientist working with deep learning needs to recognize they have an incredibly high leverage tool that they're using that can influence society in lots of ways. And if they're doing research, that that research is going to be used by people doing this kind of work. And they have a responsibility to consider the consequences and to think about things like how will humans be in the loop here? How do we avoid runaway feedback loops? How do we ensure an appeals process for humans that are impacted by my algorithm? How do I ensure that the constraints of my algorithm are adequately explained to the people that end up using them? There's all kinds of human issues which only data scientists are actually in the right place to educate people about. But data scientists tend to think of themselves as just engineers and that they don't need to be part of that process. Which is wrong. Well, you're in a perfect position to educate them better to read literature, to read history, to learn from history. Well, Jeremy, thank you so much for everything you do for inspiring huge amount of people, getting them into deep learning and having the ripple effects. The flap of a butterfly's wings that will probably change the world. So thank you very much. Cheers.","label":1}

Please try not to close your mind and heart to others because of a single sentence or an expression of an idea. Try to assume that the people in this conversation or just people in general are good, but not perfect and far from it, but always striving to add a bit more love into the world in whatever way we know how. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube, review it on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon, or connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein. You often talk about getting off this planet, and I think you don't often talk about extra terrestrial life, intelligent life out there. Do you wonder about this kind of thing about intelligent civilizations out there? I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way. In a certain sense, I do find that speculating about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and space aliens is kind of a recreation for when things aren't going very well. It leads to gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives. So I worry about, for example, the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion. You can't quite believe enough to go to church or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend, so then you just take up an interest in the simulation theory because that's something like what you do for your job coding. I do think that in some sense, the issue of aliens is a really interesting one, but has been spoiled by too much sort of recreational escapism. The key question that I find is, let's assume that it is possible to look out at the night sky and see all of these distant worlds and then go visit them. If that is possible, it's almost certainly possible through some as yet unknown or not accepted theory of physics beyond Einstein. And I mean, it doesn't have to be that way, but probably is. If that theory exists, there would be a percentage of the worlds that have life in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way that would have encountered the ability to escape soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom at a minimum and whatever they have that is probably analogous to the cell on that world. So assuming that life is a fairly generic thing that arises, probably not carbon-based, probably doesn't have DNA, but that something that fits the pattern of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation, differential success. And thereby constantly improving and so on that through time, there'll be a trajectory where there'll be something increasingly complex and fascinating and beautiful like us humans, but much more. That can also off-gas whatever entropy it creates to give an illusion that you're defeating thermodynamics. So whatever these things are, probably has an analog of the bilipid layer so that cells can get rid of the chaos on one side of the barrier and keep order on the other. Whatever these things are that create life, assuming that there is a theory to be found that allows that civilization to diversify, we would have to imagine that such a civilization might've taken an interest in its concept of the universe and have come here. They would come here. They would have a deep understanding of the physics of the universe sufficient to have arrived here. Well, there's two questions, whether they could arrive physically and whether their information could be sent here and whether they could gain information from us. It's possible that they would have a way of looking into our world without actually reaching it. I don't know, but yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world, can be realized if that's feasible, then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true and that somebody else should be here. First of all, I wanna say this. My purpose when I come on to your show and I reframe the questions is not to challenge you. I can sit inside all of those. It's to give you better audio and video because I think we've been on an incredible role. I really love what you do. And so I am trying to honor you by being as disagreeable about frame breaking as possible. I think some of your listeners don't understand that it's actually a sign of respect as opposed to some sort of a complex dynamic, which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames and that these are sort of offerings to get the conversation started. So let me try to break that frame and give you something different. Beautiful. I think what's going on here is that I can prove effectively that we're not thinking about this in very deep terms. As soon as I say we've gotta get off this planet, the number of people who assume that I'm talking about faster than light travel is very high. And faster than light travel assumes some sort of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken by some small adjustment. And I think that that's fascinating. It shows me that our failure to imagine what could be being said is profound. We don't have an idea of all of the different ways in which we might be able to visit distant worlds. All we think about is, okay, it must be Einsteinian space times and then some means of exceeding the speed limit. And it's fascinating to me that we don't really have, we've lost the ability to just realize we don't know the framework. And what does it even mean? So one of the things I think about a lot is worlds with more than one temporal dimension. It's very hard to think about more than one temporal dimension. So that's a really strong mental exercise of breaking the framework in which we think. Because most of the frameworks would have a single temporal dimension, right? Well, first of all, most of the frameworks in which we think would have no temporal dimension would have pure, like in mathematics, the differential geometry that Riemann came up with in the 1800s. We don't usually talk about what we would call split signature metrics or Lorentzian signature. In fact, if it weren't for relativity, this would be the most obscure topic out there. Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature, and then there's this one frequency and then there's this one freakish case of relativity theory in physics that uses this one time and the rest spatial dimensions. Fascinating. So it's usually momentary and just looking at space. Yes, we have these three kinds of equations that are very important to us. We have elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic, right? And so the idea is if I'm chewing gum after eating garlic bread, when I open my mouth and I've got chewing gum between my lips, maybe it's gonna form an elliptic object called a minimal surface. Then when I pop that and blow through it, you're gonna hear a noise that's gonna travel to you by a wave equation, which is gonna be hyperbolic. But then the garlic breath is gonna diffuse towards you and you're eventually gonna be very upset with me according to a heat equation, which will be parabolic. So those are the three basic paradigms for most of the work that we do. And a lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic, whereas the physicists are in the hyperbolic case. And I don't even know what to do about more than one temporal dimension because I think almost no one studies that. I can't believe you just captured much of modern physics in the example of chewing gum. Well, I have an off-color one, which I chose not to share, but hopefully the kids at home- Can imagine. Okay, so, okay, that is the place where we come from. Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility of breaking the frameworks with two versus zero temporal dimensions, how do we even begin to think about that? Well, let's think about it as you and I getting together in New York City, okay? So if you tell me, Eric, I wanna meet you in New York City, go to the corner of, I don't know, 34th Street and 3rd Avenue, and you'll find a building on the northwest corner and go up to the 17th floor, right? So when we have 3rd Avenue, that's one coordinate, 34th Street, that's a second coordinate, and go up to the 17th. And what time is it? Oh, 12 noon. All right, well now, imagine that we traded the ability to get up to a particular height in a building, and it's all flatland. But I'm gonna give you two temporal coordinates. So meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon at the corner of 34th and 3rd. That gets to be too mind-blowing. I've got two separate watches. And presumably that's just specifying a single point in those two different dimensions, but then being able to travel along those dimensions. Let me see your right hand. You have no watch on that. No. Okay, I'm very concerned, Lex, that you're going through life without a wristwatch. That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch. I want you to wear it. This guy is funnier than basically any human on Earth. Lex, that has been in my family for months. It's a Fitbit. Now, what I want you to understand is, Lex Friedman is now in a position to live in two spatial and two temporal dimensions, unlike the rest of us. I clearly am only fit for four spatial dimensions. So I'm frozen, whereas you can double move. I can double move, which is funny because this is set in Austin time. So it's 4 p.m. and this is set in Los Angeles time. But that's just with an affine shift in mod 12. But my point is, wouldn't that be interesting if there were two separate time scales and you had to coordinate both of those, but you didn't have to worry about what floor of the building because everything was on the ground floor. That is the confusion that we're having. And if you do one more show, right, then they're gonna put a watch on your ankle and you're only gonna have one spatial dimension that you can move around. But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors of my theory in case we're interested in that, which is geometric unity. There is a two-two sector and a three-one and a one-three and a zero-four and a four-zero. And all of these sectors have some physical reality. We happen to live in a one-three sector. But that's the kind of thinking that we don't do. When I say we have to get off this planet, people imagine, oh, okay, it's just Einstein plus some ability to break the law. By the way, even though you did this for humor's sake, I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin who. Am I gonna get whacked? No, not quite. But he was given a Super Bowl ring to look at and he, instead of just looking at it, put it on his finger and walked away with it. Robert Kraft. Robert Kraft, that's right. So in the same way, I will, if you don't mind, walk away with this bit and taking the entirety of your life story with it because there's all these steps on it. Boy, have you lost a lot of weight. And where have I been? Exactly. Right, that's what we're talking about. We're talking about, you wanna get into aliens. Let's have an interesting alien conversation. Let's stop having the typical free will conversation, the typical alien conversation, the typical AGI morality conversation. It's like we have to recognize that we're amusing ourselves because we're not making progress. Time to have better versions of all these conversations. Is there some version of the alien conversation that could incorporate the breaking of frameworks? Well, I think so. I mean, the key question would be, we've had the Pentagon release multiple videos of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us. I just think it's also really fascinating to talk about the fact that those of us who were trained to call BS on all of this stuff just had the rug pulled out from under us by the Pentagon choosing to do this. And you know what the effect of that is? You've opened the door for every stupid theory known to man. My aunt saw a ghost. Okay, now we're gonna have to listen to, well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it. Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude. Whoever is in charge of lying to the public, they need a cost function that incorporates the damage and trust because I held this line that this was all garbage and all BS. Now I don't know what to think. There's a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion, the breaking of frameworks that involves the release of videos from the Pentagon, which is almost like another dimension that trust in itself or the nature of truth and information is a kind of dimension along which we're traveling constantly that is messing with my head to think about because it almost feels like you need to incorporate that into your study of the nature of reality is like the constant shifting of the notation, the tools we use to communicate that reality. And so like, what am I supposed to think about these videos? Is it a complete distraction? Is it a kind of cosmic joke? I don't know, but you know what? I'm tired of these people, just completely tired of these. The people on the Pentagon side or the people who are interpreting the stuff on the Pentagon side? I'm tired of the authorities playing games with what we can know. The fact that you and I don't, do you have a security clearance? Some level of it for, because I was fond of for DARPA for awhile. I don't have a security clearance. You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have. And my guess is that there is zero interest from our own government. And so the Chinese will find out about it at the same time. Our government does, because Lord knows what they do in these buildings. I watch crazy people walk in and out of the intelligence community, walk in and out of DARPA. And I think, wow, you're talking to that person? That's really fascinating to me. We don't seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball. Complete lack of transparency. Do you think it's possible there's, the government is in possession of something deeply fundamental to our understanding of the world that they're not releasing. So this is one thing is, this is one of the famous distractions that people play with the narrative. Assume that that were true. Of alien life forms, spacecraft in possession, that the government is in possession of alien spacecraft. Assume that were true. That's the popular narrative, yeah. I don't think the government really exists at the moment. I believe, and this is not an idea that was original to me. There was a guy named Michael Tittlebaum who used to be at the Sloan Foundation. And at some point I pointed out that the US government had completely contradictory objectives when it came to the military and science. And one branch said this, one branch said that. I said, you know, I don't understand which is true. What does the government want? He said, do you think there's a government? And I said, what do you mean? He said, what makes you think that the people in those two offices have ever coordinated? What is it that allows each office to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office? And that's when I first started to understand that there are periods where the government coheres, and then there are periods where the coherence just decays. And I think that that's been going on since 1945. That there have been a few places where there's been increased coherence, but in general, everything is just getting less and less coherent. And that what war did was focus us on the need to have a government of people, a mission, capacity, technology, commitment, ideology. And then as soon as that was gone, you know, different people, those who'd been through World War II had one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s, or late 40s by the time they got to Woodstock, they didn't buy any of that. So coherence is the complete opposite of like, of bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy. So coherence is efficient functional government, because when you say there's no government, meaning there's no emergent function from a collection of individuals, it's just a bunch of individuals stuck in their offices without any kind of efficient communication with each other on a single mission. And so a government that is truly at the epitome of what a government is supposed to be is when a bunch of people working together. What are we about? Are we about freedom? Are we about growth? Are we about decency and fairness? Are we about the absence of a national culture so that we can all just do our own thing? I've called this thing the USAN, the United States of Absolutely Nothing. These are all different visions for our country. So it's possible that there's a alien spacecraft somewhere and there's like 20 people that know about it. And then they're kind of, it like as you communicate further and further into the offices, that information dissipates, it gets distorted in some kind of way. And then it's completely lost. The power, the possibility of that information is lost. We bought a house and I had this idea that I wanted to find out what all the switches did. And I quickly found out that your house doesn't keep updating its plans. As people do modifications, they just do the modifications and they don't actually record why they were doing what they were doing or what things lead to. So there are all sorts of bizarre, like there's a switch in my house that says privacy. I don't know what privacy is. Does it turn on an electromagnetic field? Does some lead shielding go over the house? That's what we have. We have a system in which the people who've inherited these structures have no idea why their grandparents built them. I'd be funny if there's a freedom of speech switch that you could also control. Then it would be a perfect metaphor for our current state of things. Well, that's different because what they figured out is, is that if they can just make sure that we don't have any public options for communication, then hey, every thing that we say to each other goes through a private company. Private companies can do whatever they want. And this is like one of the greatest moves that we didn't really notice. Electronic and digital speech makes every other kind of speech irrelevant. And because there is no public option, guess what? There's always somebody named Sundar or Jack or Mark who controls whether or not you can speak and what it appears to be that is being said and whose stuff is weighted more highly than others. It's an absolute nightmare. And by the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite, Lord knows what is going on. People are so busy making money that they are not actually upholding any of the values. So Silicon Valley is sort of maximally against, it has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen to it when it goes to Burning Man. And then it quickly just imposes rules on all of the rest of us as to what we can say to each other if we're not part of the inner elite. So what do you think the ideal of the freedom of speech means? Well, this is very interesting. I keep getting lectured on social media by people who have no idea how much power the Supreme Court has to abstract things. Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. And the spirit of the law would have to say that our speech that matters is free, at least at the level of ideas. I don't claim that I have the right to endanger your life with speech or to reveal your private information. So I really am not opining about directed speech intended to smear you. And that's a different kettle of fish. And maybe I have some rights to do that, but I don't think that they're infinite. What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas is essential that the court abstract it and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are, because it really matters which abstraction you use. The case that I really like is search and seizure. If I have private data that I entered in my house that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house, but I view is the abstraction that it's only the perimeter of my house that I have the right to protect, or does my password extend the perimeter of my house to the data on the server that is located outside of my house? These are court, are choices for the court. And the court is supposed to pretend that they can divine the true intent of the framers. But all of the sort of, and I've taken the call on this, the problem of internet hyenas, people with ready-made answers and LOLs, and you're such a moron. These folks love to remind you, it's a private company dude, it can do whatever it wants. No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are. And just the way, for example, the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra because there was too little in the constitution, therefore there were all sorts of things implied that couldn't be in the document. Somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now that says, Jack cannot do it over he wants. It's really, so you say the courts, but it's also us, people who think about the world, it's you. It's the courts. But the courts don't do this, we're toast. But we can still think about it. I mean, I'll- Sure, but I don't feel like going down the drain. Here's what I'm thinking about, because it's tricky how far it should extend. I mean, that's an ongoing conversation. Don't you think the interpretation of the law? I think I'm trying to say something very simple, and it's just not gonna be popular for a while. Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication. Print or shouting in a public park. And so, I can go to a public park and I can shout if I get a permit. Even there, I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta, we came up with free speech zones where you can't protest at a convention, you bet you can go to a park 23 miles out and they'll fence off a little area where you can have your free speech. No, speech is dangerous. Ideas are dangerous. We are a country about danger and risk. And yes, I agree that targeted speech at individuals trying to reveal their private stuff and all that kind of, that is very different. So, forget a lot of that stuff. But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous. And people will die as a result of free speech. The idea that one life is too much is preposterous. Like, why did we send, if one life is preposterous, why did we send anyone to the beaches of Normandy? I just don't get this. So, one thing that I was clearly bothered by, and maybe you can be my therapist as well. I thought you were mine. This is a little bit of a miscommunication on both our parts then. Because who is paying who for this? I was really bothered by Amazon banning Parler from AWS because my assumption was that the infrastructure, I drew a distinction between AWS, the infrastructure on which competing platforms could be created is different than the actual platforms. So, the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech, I, in my mind, in a shallow way perhaps, applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter. It felt that we've created a more dangerous world, that freedoms were violated by banning Parler from AWS, which I saw as the computing infrastructure which enables the competition of tools, the competition of frameworks of communication. What do you think about this? First of all, let me give you the internet hyena answer. I don't understand, dude. Just build your own Amazon. Yeah. Right? Yes. Well, so that's a very shallow statement, but it's also one that has some legitimacy. We can't completely dismiss it because there's levels to this game. Yes and no, but if you really wanted to chase that down, one of the great things about a person-to-person conversation as opposed to like, let's have 30 of our closest friends. Whenever we have a conversation with 30 of our closest friends, you know what happens? It's like passing light through a prism. Every person says something interesting. And as a result, it's always muddled. Like nothing ever resolves. Well, one of my conversational techniques you mentioned, you pushed back, is first is childlike naivety and curiosity, but also- Real or simulated? Real, I'm afraid. I would say 80% real. All right, so in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming? I mean, I did a show with Ashley Matthews, who's the woman behind Riley Reid, and specifically about this. It was about the idea that if I move away from politics and go towards sex, I know that there's always a move to use the infrastructure to shut down sex workers. And in this case, we had Operation Choke Point under the Obama administration. We have a positive passion for people who want to solve problems that they don't like this company, they don't like that company, payday loans would be another one. And so you have legal companies that are harassed by our financial system that you can't, you know, as Riley Reid, Ashley couldn't get a MailChimp account according to her, if I understand her correctly. And this idea that you charge these people higher rates because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards, even if their chargebacks are low. Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment. There's something about everybody who shows up at Davos, they get drunk in the Swiss Alps, and then they come back home and they coordinate, and they coordinate things like Build Back Better. We don't really understand what Build Back Better is, but my guess is, is that Build Back Better has to do with extremism in America. How do we shut down the Republican Party as the source of extremism? Now, I do think the Republican Party got very extreme under Trump. And I do believe that that was responsive to how extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first and then Obama, and then Hillary. And in all of these circumstances, it's amazing how much we want to wield these things as weapons. Well, our extremism is fine, because we pretend that Tifa doesn't exist, and we don't report what goes on in Portland, but your extremism, my God, that's disgusting. This is the completely ridiculous place that we're in. And by the way, our friends, in part, are coked up on tech money, and they don't appear to hold the courage of their convictions at a political level, because it's not in keeping with shareholder value. At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate shield with which everyone can cloak themselves. Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned from Twitter, and I'm not sure it was a good financial decision for Twitter, right? Perhaps you can correct me if I'm wrong. Well, are you thinking locally, or are you thinking if Twitter refused to, well, if Twitter refused to ban Donald Trump, what is the odds that the full force of the antitrust division might find them? I don't know. Oh, I see, I see. So there's a complicated thing. Well, look, these guys are all having a discussion in very practical terms. You know, you can say, you can imagine the sorts of conversation. Jack, Mark, Sundar, we're really glad you're all here. We're all trying to sing from the same hymnal and row in the same direction. We understand free speech, we're completely committed to it, but we have to draw along with extremism, guys. We just need, we need to make sure we're all on the same page. Well, they use the term violence, too, and they, I think, over-apply it. So basically, anybody... I'm telling you, I say dumb things to incentivize thoughtful conversation. Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace. Like, how old are you, Lex? You're in your mid-30s? Yeah, to late 40s. Mid, late 20s to late 40s, somewhere in there. That's the demographic, yeah. I do think that partially what's happened is is that your group has never seen functional institutions. These institutions have been so compromised for so long. You've probably never seen an adult. Sometimes I think Elon looks like an adult. I know that he has a wild lifestyle, but I also see it looking like an adult. What does an adult look like, exactly? Oh, you know, somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully, thinks about the future beyond their own lifespan. Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done, isn't wildly caught up in punitive actions, is more focused on breaking new ground than playing rent-seeking games. I mean, I really had a positive... I was so completely jazzed when Elon Musk hit it up as the world's richest person. He was like, well, that's interesting, back to work. It's just like, that's what an adult would do. That's what a grownup would do. And it just made, you know... Weirdly, I said something about, isn't it amazing that the world's richest person knows what a Lagrangian is? And he made a terrible Lagrange joke about potentials. But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately, Elon may be one of the closest things we have to an adult, and I can tell you that the internet hyenas will immediately descend as to what a fraudster he is for pumping his stock price, talking his book, and all this stuff. Shut up. So looking at the world seriously and rigorously, you're saying that the people who are running tech companies are running the mediums on which we can exercise the ideal of free speech are not adults. I think not. I think first of all, a lot of them are Silicon Valley utopian businessmen, where you talk a utopian line and you use it. You've heard my take, which is that the idealism of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts. And I believe that in many ways, the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world, a world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, is really about the software eating the world, as Mark Andreessen likes to say, that there are all these legacy properties, and by simply being a bad tech version of something that previously existed like a newspaper, you could immediately start to dwarf that by aggregating newspapers and their digital versions, because digital is so much more powerful. As a result, yes, we have lots of man children wandering around what once was the Bay Area and is now Austin and Miami and other places, maybe Singapore, that all of these people, these are friends of ours, and they're brilliant with respect to a certain amount of stuff, but none of them can get off the drip. It's amazing that none of them have FU money. We've got billionaires who don't have FU money. Okay, I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey was that there was an incitement of violence, and not just Jack Dorsey, but everybody that was banning people, and then this word violence was used as a kind of just like extremism and so on to without much reason behind it. You think it's impossible for Jack Dorsey or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult, a grownup, and reason. Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grownup. He seems like he is. Yeah. But he's under pressures. As you've discussed, it seems that he's been on the verge of almost being quite serious and transparent and real with people. I don't know where the Jack Dorsey that I met went, and I worry that that must be something behind the scenes that I can't see. From my perspective, what I think is the stress, the burden of that when people are screaming at you is overwhelming. Jack is a Zen monk. He really is. Jack is an incredibly impressive person intellectually, morally, spiritually, at least for a couple of meetings. I don't know him very well, but I'm very impressed by the person I met, and I don't know where that person is, and that terrifies me. But do you think somebody could step up in that way? No. So does a human being have the capacity to be transparent about the reasoning behind the banning? Or do you think all banning eventually, all banning of people from mediums of communication is eventually destructive? Or it's impossible for human beings to reason with ourselves about it? Well, let's see what the problem is. So my phone has been on airplane mode. I'm gonna unlock it. I'm gonna take a picture of Lex Friedman. Now, if I can, I'm gonna tweet that picture out. Great. But here's the weird part about it. Yeah. That picture sitting with Lex today. This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made. Okay, in so doing, I have just sent a picture of you and a tiny piece of text all over the planet that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth, just under half a million different accounts. Mm-hmm. And then more from sharing and so on. And we have, well, and then some of those accounts are dead. We don't really know how many places it went. Yeah. But the key issue with that tweet is that that is a non-local phenomenon. Yes. So I just broadcasted to an entire planet. Somebody in Uganda is reading that at the same time as somebody in Uruguay. Yeah. There is no known solution to have so many people with the ability to communicate non-locally because locality was part of the implicit nature of speech inside of the concept. The nature of speech inside of the constitution. Friction, locality, there were all sorts of other aspects to speech. So if you think about speech as a bundle. Mm-hmm. I like this. Ha ha. Then it got unbundled. And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on to retard the impact of speech aren't present. And we don't have the courage to say, I wonder if the First Amendment really applies in the modern era in the same way, or we have to work through an abstraction. Either we probably have to amend the constitution or we have to abstract it properly. And that issue is not something we're facing up to. I watch us constantly look backwards. We don't seem to try to come up with new ideas and new theories. Nobody really imagines that we're going to be able to wisely amend the constitution anymore in the inside of the United States. Many people abroad will say, why are these guys talking about the US? It's a US-centric program. Well, that's because nobody knows where this program lives. The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be in a physical place together is also bizarre. It could be anywhere. It doesn't really matter that it happens to be here. So the difference between logical, between physical, local, non-local, frictional, non-frictional, it's the same thing with firearms. Nobody imagined that the Gatling gun was going to be present when you had to reload a musket. And that's fascinating to think about. I mean, you're exactly right that the nature of this particular freedom that seems so foundational to this nation, to what made this nation great and perhaps much of the world that is great made it great is changing completely. Can we try to reason through how the ideal of freedom of speech is to be changed? I mean, I guess I'm struggling. It feels really wrong, perhaps because I wasn't paying attention to it, it feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump from Twitter, to ban not just the president. That's really wrong to me. But this particular human for being divisive, but then when there's an incitement of violence, that is an overused claim, but perhaps there was actual brewing of local violence happening. So one of the things I know what's happening on Parler is people were scheduling meetings together in physical space. So you're now going back from this dynamic, social, large scale, people from Uganda, people from all over the world being able to communicate, you're now mapping that into now back meeting in the physical space that is similar to what the founding. But if the violence were digital, if ransomware suddenly was unleashed, the key issue is the abstractions. So what was freedom of speech as a bundle? And now it's. And then how do we abstract the bundle into the digital era? Do you think we just need to raise the question and talk about it? Do you have ideas? Sure, I have ideas, but the key point is is that I'm not even welcome in mainstream media. I've never seen you on mainstream media. Do you do mainstream media? So we exist in part of an alternate universe because the mainstream media is trying to have a coherent story, which I've called the gated institutional narrative. And the institutions pretend that they plug their fingers in their ears and pretend that nothing exists outside of MSNBC talking to CNN about what was in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post. And so that's effectively like a professional wrestling promotion where they, you know, the undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan and Rowdy Roddy Piper. Okay, well, that's very different than MMA. You've recently been on Glenn Beck's program. Yeah. And that was just kind of one of the things you've talked about is being able to have this conversation. I don't know if you would put it as a type of conversation that was happening outside of the mainstream media, but a conversation that reaches across different worldviews. Having a nuanced or just like a respectful conversation that's grounded in mutual. But we can't have the reality because the main model is, the center, both left and right is in the process of stealing all the wealth that we built up. And they've organized the extremes into two LARPing teams that I've called Magistan and Wocastan. And then you have everybody who isn't part of that complex, all seven of us. The number of us who are able to earn a living looking at all of these mad people playing this game. You know, there's a phrase inside finance when the investment banks are trying to look at price action. And somebody says, this doesn't make any sense. And somebody will say, it's just the locals stealing from each other. And that's really what we have. We've got the leaders of Magistan and Wocastan, you know, championing these two teams as sponsored by the center because it's a distraction while they steal all the silver and cut the paintings out of the frames. That's what you and I are looking at. So when you ask me, like, do you have any ideas about the abstraction for free speech? I've never met Mark Zuckerberg. I've never met Sundar Pichai. I've never met Larry Page. I was once in a room with Sergey Brin. I've never spoken to Elon Musk. I hang out with Peter Thiel, but we have a very deep relationship, but I don't really speak to that many other people at sort of at this level. We're not having any kind of smart conversation at a national level. In fact, it's almost as if we've destroyed every sandbox in which we could play together. There's no place that we actually talk except long form podcasting. And by the way, they've found, you see what's going on with like Alex Stamos and the Hoover Institution. There's a loophole left. Long form podcasting allows people to speak at levels above daytime CNN. It's like, well, why do you think they're not watching daytime CNN? But that's just silly journalism. They currently have no power to displace podcasting. That's why it's so powerful, RSS feed. I mean, that's why the big challenge with Joe Rogan and Spotify is like, there's this dance that's fascinating to see is Joe Rogan is not part of the system and then he's also uncancellable. And there's this tension that's happening. It's fascinating. Well, think about what happened to Howard Stern, though. Howard Stern became much less relevant. So if they can't control Joe by bringing him in house, the key question is, is he going to continue? You know, this Joe says this thing about FU money. Joe's one of the only people with FU money who's actually said FU. I don't understand this. I don't have FU money. What exactly is, can we break apart FU money because I always thought I've been fortunate enough to always have FU money in the sense that my standards were so low that a basic salary in the United States. This is the stoic point, which is, if you can live on rice and beans, you're uncancellable because you're always rich relative to your needs. Isn't that FU fundamental, FU money? Why do you say that tech billionaires don't have FU money? When you need to hire private security to protect your family, how do you protect your two children? I don't have those yet. Bingo. Yeah. My point is, is that FU money insulates everything that you care about. It's not just about you. So you're saying as the level of responsibility grows, the amount of money required for FU. We have a war going on. The war is on academic freedom. Academic freedom used to be present in the system as in terms of the idea, we trust our elite. Now we have an idea like, you wanna be the elite. You want a Lord above us. First of all, there's like a populist anti-elitist thing. Then there's the idea that we're gonna defer tenure for forever. Then we're gonna tell people, stay in your lane. Your tenure is only good for your own particular tiny micro subject. Then we're gonna also control your grants and we'll be able to load up your teaching load if we don't like who you are. We'll make your life absolutely impossible. We lost academic freedom and we ushered in peer review which was a disaster. And then we lost funding so that people were confident that they would have the ability to do research no matter what they said. And as a result, what you find is a world in which there's no ability to get people to say, no, I'm not gonna sign your diversity and inclusion forced loyalty oath. I won't sign any loyalty oath. Get the hell out of my office. F you. F you and you're connecting money to that but. Well, my point is that academic freedom is, the whole idea behind it was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire on a much smaller salary. Right. Okay. We've lost that. Yeah, the only reason in part that I wanted to go into academics as a profession as opposed to wanting to do physical or mathematical research. The great prize was freedom. Ralph Gomory of the Sloan Foundation previously of IBM research pointed it out. He says, if you lose freedom, you lose the only thing we had to offer top minds. Top minds value their intellectual freedom and their physical and economic security at a different level than other human beings. And so people say, you know, I don't understand dude, and you have the ability to do X, Y and Z. What's the problem? It's like, well, I value my ability to raise the middle finger as an American, practically above everything else. I wanna talk to you about freedom here in the context of something you've mentioned, which is one way to take away freedom is to put a human being into a cage, to create constraints. The other one that worries me is something that I think you've spoken to, to Twitter a little bit on Twitter is we bleed freedom by kind of slowly scaring you into not doing, not expressing the full spectrum of opportunities you can as freedom. So like when you banned Donald Trump, when you banned parlor, you give a little doubt in the minds of millions, like me, a person who's a tech person, who's an entrepreneur, there's a little, that's what I'm afraid of when I look in the mirror. Is there now a little doubt in there that limits the amount of options I will try? How certain are you that the COVID virus didn't come from the Wuhan lab and is biosafety level four? We both know that we're both supposed to robotically say the idea that the COVID virus came from a lab is a discredited conspiracy theory. There is no evidence that suggests that this is true. The World Health Organization and the CDC have both opined this to say otherwise would be incredibly irresponsible. And the threat of that is the thing that ultimately limits the freedoms we feel. I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time. And you're afraid. It's also boring. In a sense. I mean, I said it in the public. Yeah, many times. Why is it we don't ask where the records are from the art house? Where are the financial records? Where are the SEC filings? Yeah. Where are the questions on the record to the intelligence agencies? Was he known to be part of the intelligence community? So we're not interested in asking questions. Like, am I going to die as a result of asking the question? Was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community of any nation? Is there a reason we're not asking about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund that he didn't run? Just like the Wuhan lab. Okay. How do we get to the core of the Jeff Epstein? The truth behind Jeff Epstein in a sense. I mean, there's some things that are just like useless conspiracy theories around it, even if they're true. There's some things that get to some- I hate to say it. You're not going to like it. Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break-in of the citizens committee to investigate the FBI. Those kids, and by the way, they weren't all kids, did what had to be done. They broke in, they broke the law. It was an incredible act of civil disobedience. And God blessed Judy Feingold for taking to her, she was going to take to her grave, that she'd been part of this, like the coolest thing of all time. They didn't say anything for forever. So civil disobedience. I mean, you have to- We are founded on civil disobedience. Civil disobedience is incredibly, you screw it up and you're just a vandal. You screw it up, you're a hooligan. Yeah. Those cats were so disciplined. It's an art form in a sense. It was an art form and they risked everything. They were willing to pay with their freedom. Those are the sorts of people who earned the right by putting themselves at risk. I would not do this. I am not volunteering to break into anything. I think it was William Davodon, who was a student of Murray Gell-Mann and a physics professor at Haverford, who corralled these people and led this effort. And right now, what we need is somebody to blow the lid off of what is controlling everything. We have, I'm happy to hear that it's a system of incentive structures, that it's a system of selective pressures. I'm happy to find out that it's emergent. I'm happy to find that it's partially directed by our own intelligence community. I'm happy to hear that in fact, we've been penetrating the world and that in fact, we've been penetrated by North Korea, Iran, China, and Russia. But I need to know why people aren't, like the firebombing of the courthouse in Portland, Oregon has no explanation. And somehow this is normal. This is not normal to any human being. We have video that people don't believe. And I come back to the shaggy defense of it wasn't me. You know, it's like, you remember that song? Shaggy, yeah, wasn't me caught you banging in the shower on the counter. Yeah, exactly. Wasn't me. It wasn't me. And he says, his friend says, well, your strategy makes no sense at all. Well, this is what MSNBC is doing. You dropped him from the graphic, it wasn't me. It wasn't me. You came up with another gang, it wasn't me. I will never see MSNBC the same again. So you've spoken about him before. I think it'd be nice to maybe honor him to break it apart a little bit. Aaron Schwartz. Yeah. Why was he a special human being in this ilk of what we're talking about now, civil disobedience? How do we honor him now moving forward as human beings who are willing to take risks in this world? Well, I don't know. I mean, are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz? I am. How do you feel about JSTOR? Let's talk about JSTOR first. So let's say what JSTOR is all about, right? We the taxpayer pay for research. And then, the people who do the research do all the work for a bunch of companies who then charge us $30 an article to read what it is that we already paid for. And if we don't cite these articles, we're told that we're in violation. Okay. I almost never call for civil disobedience because I don't really wanna, but fuck JSTOR, fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer. Who the fuck are these people? Yeah. Get, the smart people need to take the greedy people behind the woodshed and explain to them what science is. I have a very old fashioned idea that's so out of favor that I will immediately be seen as a knuckle-draggers. Yeah. I believe in the great woman theory of history and the great man theory of history. Emmy Nerder is fantastic. That's an example. And I believe in editors over peer reviewers. And I believe that wrong things should be allowed into the literature. And I believe that the gatekeeping should go towards zero because the costs associated with distribution are very, very slight. I believe that we should be looking at the perverse incentives of sending your paper blindly into your competitors clutches, particularly if you're a young person being reviewed by an older person. Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor? Are you familiar with the legend of the Magnaia? No, the Magnaia is the Miller's daughter. And the largest food fight in the entire universe, I believe, is held, I think in Italy, it's called the Battle of the Oranges. And it celebrates the Miller's daughter who had fallen in love with her beloved. And when it came time for them to marry, the virginal Magnaia was in fact told that the Lord of the land had the right to have the first night with the bride. Well, the Magnaia had a different idea. So she seemed to consent to this perhaps mythical right, also called the Prima Notae, the first night. And by legend, she concealed a dagger underneath her robes. And when it came time for the hated Lord of the Manor to extract this right, she pulled the knife out and killed him. And I think that also echoes a little bit of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones. But that inspired both men and women. And the Magnaia is the legendary hero. Right now, what we need to do is we need to resist the Prima Notae, the right of first look. Right? F you, you don't have the right of first look. I don't wanna send something blindly to my competitors. I don't wanna subject myself to you naming what work I've done. Why are you in my story? That's my question. Get out of my story. If I do work and then you have an idea, oh, well, it's the Matthew principle. To him who has much more will be given. I've gone to the National Academy of Sciences and talked about these things. And it's funny, I've been laughed at by the older people who think, well, Eric, you know science proceeds funeral by funeral, that's plonk. You know the Matthew principle, you know the Matilda principle that things done by women are attributed to men. These are not new. And you guys just live like this? Yeah. So the revolutionary act now is to resist all of these things that are not new. So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz. Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia. One of the things you've done very beautifully is to communicate love. And I think about, you know, some of our conversations. And you got me to talk a little bit about my own experiences in 02138 and 39. We are the product of our trauma. And what people don't understand is that very often when you see people taking countermeasures against what appear to be imaginary forces, they're really actually replaying the story they're really actually replaying things that really happened to them. And having been through this system and watching all of the ways in which it completely rewrites the lives of the people who I'm counting on to cure our diseases, build our new industries, keep us safe from our foes. The amount of pressure the system is putting on the most hopeful minds is unimaginable. And so my goal is to empower somebody like an Aaron Schwartz in memory. And to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation. You know that the first person outside of me to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein. How did he know I was working on this? I don't know. So your ideas that formed geometric unity was something that his eyes have seen? I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein as one of the only people who could help me. No, no, no, listen to this. How does this, yeah, how does this connect? Okay, well, first of all, my old synagogue, my old shul was the conservative minion at Harvard Hillel. And I believe it's called Rzoszki Hall after Henry Rzoszki in the economics department who was a Japan scholar if I'm correct. And he became provost or dean of Harvard. I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein's money. And I wondered in part whether the Jewish students at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck of Harvard Hillel. So that was something I found very curious, but I don't know much about it. I also found that Jeffrey Epstein hanging around scientists, I don't think that either you or Joe exactly, I mean, got me correct in your last interchange. For the record, for people who haven't listened to Joe, the program Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein was the only person who has gotten laid. Paid. Oh, paid. And you said you also got paid as a young man, right? I believe the word was laid, but allegedly. My hearing isn't so good at age 55. Yeah. All right, leaving that aside. Yes. What was Jeffrey Epstein doing hanging around all of these scientists? I don't think that was the same program that was about compromising political leaders and business people and entertainment figures. I think these are two different programs that were being run through one individual. And Joe seemed to think that I didn't think he was smooth. I thought he was glib. I think what Joe was really trying to get at is that I found his mysticism meretricious. He had an ability to deflect every conversation that might go into the conversation. That might go towards revealing that he didn't know what he was talking about. Every time you started to get close to something where the rubber hit the road, the rubber wouldn't hit the road. And yet, can you help me untangle the fact that you thought deeply about the physics of the nature of our universe and Jeffrey Epstein was interested? How did he know? I wasn't really talking about this stuff until even my close friends didn't really know what I was up to. And yet you're saying he did not have sufficient brilliance to understand when the rubber hit the road. So why did he have sufficient interest and curiosity? I'll tell you what I thought. I had been waiting to find out, does my government even know I exist? Do you have an answer to that question? I have, a couple times, the government has reached out to me. In general, there is zero interest in me, like less than zero interest. I find that fascinating. As far as you know, right? I mean- Well, that's what I'm trying to say. The question about not being able to see through a half-silvered mirror, you don't know what's going on behind the half-silvered mirror. To you, it's all you see is your reflection. But your intuition still holds. Like this is where I've mentioned that I, this is where I'll say naive dumb things, but I still hold onto this intuition that Jeff, I'm not confident in this, but I'm leaning towards that direction that Jeffrey Epstein is the source of evil, not something that's underlying him. You have a bias. It's different than mine. Our Bayesian priors are tutored by different life experiences. Yeah. If I was mostly concerned, like Sam Harris, is concerned that people fill their heads with nonsense, I would have a very strong sense that people need order in the world, that they take mysterious situations, they build entire castles in the air, and then they go move in if they really get crazy. The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air and psychotics move in. Coming from a progressive family, we had a different experience. It's really weird when the government is actually out there, it's really weird when the government is actually out to get you, when they actually send a spy, when they actually engage in disinformation campaigns, when they smear you. And if you've ever had that brought to bear on your family, you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding of the country, which is different than having a, wow, do people believe crazy stuff because they watch too much TV? And both of these things have some merit to them, but it's a question of regulated expression. When do you want to express more Sam Harris and when do you want to express more Howard Zinn? And you can express both, correct? The one human being can express both? Sure, but there's a trade-off between them. In other words, most people, like the Michael Shermers of the world are gonna tilt very strongly to extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, you're gonna have that kind of energy. And then somebody else is gonna say, how many times do I have to get hit on, how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb before I realize that there's a problem? So, my feeling about this is yes, people see patterns in clouds, they see faces and scripture and all sorts of things, and it's just random cloud patterns. And it's also the case that there's tremendous pressure not to see conspiracies when conspiracies are relatively more common than the people who shout conspiracy theory will claim. So both of these things are true. And you have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn and when you're inner Harris? And those are different. And one fundamental difference between you and I, biases aside, is you've actually met Jeffrey Epstein. And I'm listening to like reverberations years later of stories and narratives through the story. Luckily, I only met him once. And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations with him other than the one meeting. You can learn a lot in just a few words, right? From a human being. Well, that's true. But I think that the bigger issue was, I saw something that I don't hear much remarked upon, which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is. In other words, there's the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes. There's all this stuff that kind of has the same feel to it, a little bit of variation and difference, Department of Energy. If you fall outside of that, there's just Jeffrey Epstein. That's what you're told. Yes. That's not quite true. There's Kavli, maybe Jim Simons is now in the game. Peter Thiel has done some stuff. You had Uri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try. So there is other money running around, Templeton. But very strongly, there was a belief that if you're doing something really innovative and the system can't fund it because we've become pussies, Jeffrey Epstein is your guy. So there's that because it's funnel that you're supposed to go through. That's right. And the idea is that you get called to the great man's house and the sort of lubricious version of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions. And maybe he has an island, maybe he has a plane. And when you're starved, somebody showing you a feast or when you're dehydrated and at death's door and somebody says, oh, I have a well, that's what it is. And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing money into the science system so that we don't have super creeps trying to learn all of our secrets ahead of time? WTF, what is your problem with transparency and taxpayer dollars? Just all of you, you wouldn't have a country. You'd be speaking German. So essentially you believe that human beings would not be able to when the money is lacking in the system, like in research. We produce public goods. You and I are meant to produce public goods. Now I sell athletic greens and I sell Theragun and I sell Unagi scooters and Chili Pat. I gotta be honest, I love these products, but I didn't get into this game for the purpose of selling. I'm trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle? But you know something, Lex, I don't know why you built this channel, it's kind of a mystery. Yeah, I don't know why. I'll tell you why I built my channel. The freedom. It's gonna be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley. Yeah. I got rolled multiple times and my point is, I didn't want to become a celebrity. I didn't want to become well-known, but it's a lot harder to be a celebrity. It's a lot harder to roll somebody who's getting, I think I'm, I don't know if this is mistaken, but I think I am the math PhD with the largest number of followers on Twitter. And there was nothing you could do before. I mean, again, to put a little responsibility and you've created something really special for the distribution of your own ideas. I mean, but because it's not necessarily currently scalable, you also perhaps you and I have the responsibility of giving other people also a chance to spread their ideas. I mean, Joe Rogan did this very effectively for a bunch of people that- That's why they're angry at him because he's a gatekeeper and he let all sorts of people through that gate from Roger Penrose to Alex Jones. To Jordan Peterson, to, I mean, even, well, first of all, to you and- To Abby Martin. To Abby Martin. To Barry Weiss. Yeah. That's the problem. Well, but you have not successfully built up a thing that allows that to carry that forward. No, no, no, no. We are all vulnerable to reputational attack because what happens, you see, the problem, Lex, is that you are now an institution at some level. You walk around with all this equipment in a duffle bag. The last suit you'll ever need. And you have the reach of something like CNN to people who matter. Okay. So now the question is, how do we control something that doesn't have a board, doesn't have shareholders, doesn't have to make SEC filings, FCC? So the best answer they have is, well, we just have to destroy reputations. All it takes is for us to take something that gets said or done or alleged. And I think it's incredibly important. One of the things people don't understand is that I'm going to fight general reputational attacks, not because some people don't deserve to have their reputations dragged through the mud, but because it's too powerful of a tool to hand it to CNN, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard, the state of New York, MSNBC, Princeton, Harvard, the state department. Yes. But some of it is also- J.P. Morgan. Muhammad Ali style, being good enough at doing everything you need to do without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks. Not being afraid, but not giving enough meat. I don't see why the people who have good ideas have to lead lives that are that clean. If you can do it- You can be messy, yeah. You should be able to be messy, that otherwise we're suppressing too many people. Two billion minds. Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt? I still, people tell me this. Okay, I have discussions about Elon and people, the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist who's talking about a Muamua that it might be alien technology. He told me this outside the box thinker. Yeah. When speaking to me about Elon, called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed. He's the blunt in a dismissive way. Like this guy is crazy because he smoked some weed. I was looking at him. I was like, wow, wow. Look, I think you should be able to have consensual drug-filled orgies. Fuck perfect lives. Yeah, you should be allowed to be messy. Yeah, right. I take back my statement. I'm just saying- Respectability is the unique prison where all of the gates are open and the inmates beg to stay inside. It's time to end their prison of respectability because it's too effective of a means of sidelining and silencing people, including it is better that we have bad people in our system than this idea of no platforming people who are beyond the pale because it's such a simple technique. So how do we, what's the heroic action here on the- Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program. By the way, she was absolutely delightful as a guest. She was, she is polite in the extreme, far more polite than I am. And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest because I wanted to highlight this program can go anywhere. We can talk to anyone. What about social media? You've started highlighting people being banned on social media. How do we fight this? Like if you get banned from social media, so you're saying nobody will stand up to me? Well, just figure out what your incentive structure is before. Assume that there, assume that I get banned on social media because somebody wants to make sure that my message doesn't interfere with the dominant narrative. Yeah. Okay. What will happen? By the way, I'm very glad to be able to explain this on your show because that video will presumably be archived and they can't easily make you take it down. Okay. So what's going to happen is, is that there'll be a whole bunch of very low quality bot-like accounts that dog you every time you talk about me. Right. Dude, it's getting old, getting boring. We already heard you. Dude, that was like, let it go. Not a good look. Not a good look is one of my favorites. But what about the high profile ones? Well, then you'll get a few high profile ones and some of the high profile ones command armies. Right. Like at some point I had 10,000 people using exactly the same templated tweet, tweeting at me. It was just actually, it got to me. It was just actually, it got to the point where it was funny because everybody said, did you hear that in hipster coffee shop? I was like, why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee? It's hilarious. Those things will cause you to think better of it. You'll start to see your follower count go down because it's easy to give you a bunch of bot-like follows and then just pull them. So I think that it's pretty well known how, and then maybe your account will be suspended and it can't be revoked and et cetera, et cetera. And then three days later, you'll be told it was an error. So let me push back. I just don't see not defending you. Okay, so what are the things you would do that, given that I can actually talk to you offline, that would make me not defend you? Well, first of all, I can't, I mean, I can imagine some. But all of us have things. If somebody says, do you hear what your boy Lex said about you? What did Lex say about me? Oh, he said you were flawed, dude. Oh shit. They so distrust because none of us want to stand behind flawed people. That's why you have everybody rushing to say, I neither condemn nor condone. I know I don't condemn nor, what is that? We're all trying to say- By the way, for the record, I said that Eric is smarter than me in a brilliant human being, but flawed like all humans are. My point is I've now come up with a new policy, which is I don't care what my friends have done. I am not disavowing my friends, not because they didn't do the wrong thing. Maybe they did do the wrong thing. I don't know. What's the value of friendship if that's not that. Like, for example, we've had the situation with Brian Callan. Brian Callan was featured recently in the Los Angeles Times. I know nothing about the allegations. I can't. I didn't even know Brian at the time. Right? I've known him for roughly the time I've been in Los Angeles, maybe a year and a half during that period of time. I've never seen anything wrong. Now I'm in a situation, what do you think he did? Do you think he didn't? It's like, you know what? I don't know, but I do know this. Everyone's entitled to have friends because we can't afford isolated people. And if your friends do the wrong thing, they're still your friends. And if they do terrible, terrible things, you bring that up with them privately. And it's not my responsibility to disavow in public. You know, we've had this situation that I don't like where, you know, particular people that I've been close to, I'm put under tremendous pressure to disavow them. What do you think now about your buddy? I like Dave Rubin and all that kind of stuff. Here's the thing. My friends are my friends. I don't disavow my friends. We all need to make a statement that we will not be brought under pressure to disavow our friends, our family members, because mass murders are dangerous. The more isolated they become, it is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people. Yes. And it's dangerous. And so it sends a signal to everybody else to fit in, to be more cynical about the human. So my feeling, if I find out you've been selling heroin to elementary school students, you're still my friend and I will not be disavowing you. And if I have a problem with you selling heroin to elementary school students during school hours, I will bring it up with you privately because we don't need to hear my voice added to that condemnation. Are there things that you could do that would cause me to say, actually, F this guy? Yeah, above and beyond that. But simply doing the wrong thing. I think we've gone down a terrible path. I think isolated people are about the most dangerous thing we could have in a heavily armed society. So I deeply agree with you on Brian Callahan and on all these people that quote unquote got canceled. And I'm not saying that I don't know the truth value because we can't. And even if I did know the truth value, I'm not setting up an incentive structure for the personal destruction as a means of letting institutions combat the fact that individuals are the last thing that can say, none of you guys make any sense. I don't treat these things like, you know, I had a conversation where Kevin Spacey was at the dinner table when I came down from a hotel room. And I had a very long conversation with Kevin Spacey. I will not detail because I don't do that as to what we discussed. But we talked very specifically about him being canceled. And I don't think that the world has heard that story in part because there's a very strong sense that he has to be outgrouped. And as a result, you know, I mean, do we want, do we want to disavow the space program because it touched Werner von Braun? Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics because Pascal Jordan and Werner Heisenberg passed through it? Is Ehrenfest theorem false because he murdered his child? I mean, at what point do we recognize that we are the problem? Humans are humans. And there is no perfect, there is no perfect group of people, even all of the most oppressed people, the supposed victims of the world who we now have fetishized into thinking that they're all oracles because their lived experience informs us and their pain is more salient than everyone else's pain. Those people aren't necessarily great people, you know? It's like none of us, none of us, none of us, we can't do this in this fashion. So when we sit down to have a conversation across the table from somebody, you should be willing to, like you should not have NPR in your mind, you should be willing to take the full risk and to see the good in the person with limited information and to do your best to understand that person. Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget. I don't believe this is of institutions. Yeah. Okay. Everybody is entitled to a certain amount of screwing up in life. You're entitled to a mendacity budget. You're entitled to an aggression budget. The idea of getting rid of everybody is, you know, people haven't even blown through their budgets and we're already. Yeah. I think about, for example, one person, I'd be curious to get your thoughts about Alex Jones. Let's not talk about Alex Jones for a second. Let's talk about the National Enquirer. Is everything the National Enquirer says false? No. Okay. Do you remember the John Edwards story? Did you know his wife? Sorry. He had a child from an extramarital affair. Yes. I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story. And then what does the New York Times do? The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report that the National Enquirer is making a claim. That way they don't have to substantiate the story. So why is the New York Times talking to Mike Cernovich or using the National Enquirer as a source? Are they using Alex Jones as a source? Who? Here's the big problem that we're having. Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody and other people are entitled to talk to no one? I don't really understand this. This is an indulgence system. This is how the Catholic Church used to do things. It's hard to fight the system because the reason you don't talk to Alex Jones is because they're not talking to Alex Jones is because the platforms on which you do the communication will move you. But I'm not platformed. I used to do NPR and I used to do the NewsHour and I used to provide stories to Washington Post, New York Times. That has gone away. They've circled the wagons closer and closer and more of us are unacceptable. Right now, I have no question that they're going through anybody who has a platform trying to say, okay, what do we have against that person in case we need to shut that down? We have to make a different decision, Alex, and the different decision is that it doesn't matter how many times Joe said the N word. It doesn't matter that somebody else, with mathematical theorems, if the worst person in the world proves a mathematical theorem like the Unabomber, we can't undo the theorem. And I point out Charles Manson's song, Look At Your Game Girl is an amazing song. It's a really good song. I don't think it's one of the greatest songs ever, but it happens that he wasn't a no talent. And I don't know how Hitler was as an artist. It's actually not bad. Okay, we've got to get past this. We've got to get past this idea that we're going to purge ourselves of our badness and we're just going to, this is like, I've likened it to teenage girls and cutting. We're just, all we're doing is destroying ourselves in search of perfection. And the answer is no, we're not perfect. We're flawed, we're screwed up. And we've always been this way. And we're not going to silence everyone who you can point a laser beam at and say, well, that person, look at how bad that person is. If we do that, kiss the whole thing goodbye. We might as well just, let's learn Chinese. But there is an art to having those messy conversations, whether with Alex or anybody else. Okay, let's talk about Alex. There's particular stuff that Alex does that's absolutely nauseating. And there's other stuff that he's doing that's funny. The methodology of the way he carries. And sometimes he's talking about the truth. And sometimes he's talking about a conspiracy theory. His variance is incredibly high. The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O'Keefe or the National Enquirer or anything else that you don't like is to say, great, go long short. What's that mean? Well, if you invest in a mutual fund, all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long. But if you invest in a hedge fund, you do something called relative value trade. It's like, well, you long tech or short tech? Well, actually I'm long Microsoft and I'm short Google. Why is that? Oh, because I believe Google got way too much money. I believe Google got way too much attention and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned. And so this is really a play on legacy tech over more modern tech. Okay. Which part of Alex Jones are you long and which part are you short? One of the things that should be a requirement for being a reporter is like, what did Donald Trump do that was good? Nothing. Okay, then you're not a reporter. What did Hitler do that was good? The Rosenstrasse protest. Non-Jewish women campaigned for their Jewish men to be returned home to them from certain death, almost in death camps. It should have been that there were no death camps. It should have been that everybody was returned home. But you know what? The fact that the women of the Rosenstrasse protest, I'm sorry, I get very emotional about this. Some of the bad guys that were there and some of the baddest ass chicks in the world got their husbands returned to them. Kolok a vote. And not celebrating Hitler, Hitler's the worst of the worst. But God damn it, you know, this idea that we can just say everything that person does is a lie, everything that person does is evil. This reflects a simplicity of mind that humanity cannot afford. Is Google evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf? Is Amazon evil because it will sell you Mein Kampf? If you find out that Mein Kampf rests on somebody's bookshelf, do you have any idea what it means? If you find out that a scholar used the N word, should that person lose their job? Come on, grow the hell up. I guess our responsibility to lead by example in that, because you have to acknowledge that the current public discourse. Have somebody on your podcast who you're worried about. But do it in a principled fashion. I mean, in other words, I'm not here to whitewash everything. On the other hand, if somebody makes some allegations, I don't know that I'm obligated to treat every set of allegations as if, no, how do you defend yourself against, no. Allegations are so cheap to make at this moment. Well, my sort of my standard, I don't know if you maybe you could speak to it is, I don't care like in the case of Alex Jones, for example, I don't, I'm willing to have a conversation with Alex Jones and people like him if I know he's not going to try to manipulate me. Assume that he is gonna try to manipulate you. I can't, then we're not going to be two humans. Okay, but Lex, I want you to think well of me. I put on a jacket. I don't usually wear a jacket, okay? Thank you, Eric. All right, I'm trying to manipulate you. There's an entire field, no, there's an entire field that says that speech may be best thought of as an attempt to manipulate each other. This is too simplistic. Everything that we keep talking through. Yes. You know better than this. I disagree. I think there's ways, there's, of course, it's a gray area, but there is a threshold where your intent with which you come to a meeting, to an interaction is one that is not one that's grounded in like a respect for a common humanity, like a love for each other. As deeply messy. If somebody's doing really bad stuff, I expect you to try to keep them from doing really bad stuff. But you know, just keep in mind that when I was a younger man, I saw an amazing anti-pornography documentary, and it was called Rate It X, and I don't know where it went. But the conceit of it was, we're gonna get some pornographers in front of a camera because they wanna talk, and we're gonna ask them about what they do for a living and why it's okay. No commentary. Okay? You could potentially, if you really think Alex Jones is the worst, and again, I'm not intimately familiar with him, you could decide to just let him talk. Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people. I've spoken to Stefan Molyneux. Stefan Molyneux makes many good points, he makes many bad points, and he makes many good points in bad ways. And I worry about it, and I don't feel that it's not my obligation to make sure that Stefan Molyneux has a voice on the portal. But I did stand up and say, I didn't want him banned from social media. And I do think that a lot of the people who are being banned from social media were worried that they're right rather than that they're wrong. I certainly don't really think that I'm worried in some sense that some of the really wrong people are wrong. But if you look at, for example, Curtis Yarvin, there's a tremendous amount of interest. Is Eric going to speak to Curtis Yarvin? Curtis Yarvin says many interesting things. And he says many horrible, stupid things, very provocative. And I haven't invited him onto the portal, but I haven't said, I will never invite him onto the portal. We are all in a difficult position. That's what I'm saying. You're making it kind of, I think it's a much more difficult task that and burden carry it as people who have conversations because Curtis Yarvin is a good example. How much work do I have to put in reading Curtis' work to really understand? We should talk about the problem of Curtis Yarvin. Because I think it's probably illustrative. There's this big question as why does somebody who says such stupid ass things listen to by so many people? Very smart people, people who are part of our daily lives discuss Curtis Yarvin in hushed tones. Now, my belief is that Curtis Yarvin has made a number of very interesting, provocative points. And they associate Curtis Yarvin as the person who has made these points. And they treat the completely asinine stuff that he says that's super dangerous as, well, that's Curtis, right? Right. They give him the credit for, he's a kind of like, sorry to use the term, first principles, deep thinker about the way the world, in some space about the world. But as a result, we don't actually know why Curtis Yarvin is knocking around so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives. See, you said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff. And that's a sense I got from a few things I've read, not just about it. This is not just like Wikipedia stuff. Is he, he's a little, like I've said before, he seems to be careless. I don't think he's careless. No, no, no, it's like Jim Watson. Jim Watson wants to say very provocative things in order to prove that he's free. It's not a question of careless. He enjoys the freedom to say these things. And the key point is, is that there's, I expect something more of Curtis. I expect that if somebody is insightful about all sorts of things up to that point, that they're going to have enough care. Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly that vaccines are not 100% safe. Most people who have an idea that anybody is an anti-vaxxer should be silenced are in a position where they, they probably don't say vaccines are 100% safe, but you keep finding that statement over and over again, like believe all women, vaccines are 100% safe. Climate science is settled science. Whatever this mountain Bailey is, where you make extraordinarily vapid blanket claims, and then you retreat into something, well, defund the, you know, we don't want no more police, actually just means we want the police to not take on mental health duties. We've come up with an incredibly disingenuous society. And what I'm claiming is, is that I might talk to Curtis Yarvin, but I have really very little interest to talk to a guy who seems to be kind of giddy about who makes good slaves and who makes bad slaves. It's like, why do I want to do that on the portal? One, first of all, because just as you said, that's not Curtis' main thing. He has a lot of ideas. And what I've read of him, which is not a huge amount, is there's, he's very thoughtful about the way this world works. And on top of that, he's an important historical figure in the birth and the development of the alt-right, or what would be called the alt-right. The new reactionary. Yeah, and there's, so he's just an important intellectual. And so it makes sense to talk to him. The question is, how much work do you put in? Well, this is the issue of fugu. I'm not a chef that necessarily can serve that fugu. So you have a puffer fish. You can eat the puffer fish. You can get a kind of a tingly sensation on your tongue if you get a little bit of the poison organ. But my point is, I don't know how to serve Curtis Yarvin so that in fact I'm not worried about what happens. But I believe that if somebody else was a student of the new reactionary movement, that person might be in a better position to host Curtis Yarvin. So somebody, that's a really good example, somebody I think you've spoken with that's an intermediary, that's a powerful one, is Michael Malus. And he's spoken with Curtis Yarvin. And Michael wrote a book about- By the way, Michael somewhat changed my mind about Michael Malus. I'm glad he did. I think I would call him a friend. And I think he's a underneath it all, a really kind human being. And I think your skepticism about him was initially from a surface level of, what did you call him, hyenas, the trolls and so on. I'm not happy about his. It's been so long since I've seen good trolls. Yes. But he needs a higher quality of drolling, but he aspires to that. I mean, disagree or not, I really enjoy how much care he puts into the work he does like on North Korea and the study of the world and how much privately, but also in public, love he has for people, especially those who are powerless. Just a genuine admiration for them, but yeah. But I think Curtis actually- Does too. I don't know. I mean, you have to appreciate the first time I met Curtis, he introduced me, he says, I'm the most right-wing person you've ever met. I was just like, well, this is a conversation that's already over. It's theatrical in a way that's not conducted to actually having a real connection. It turned me off because it was like, you need to be the most right-wing person. And so it's like, I'm a troll, I'm a troll. Okay, why are we doing this? But what I'm trying to get at is different. I'm trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend of yours. If you found out something terrible, you should continue- You should still be a friend. You should still continue to be his friend. And in Michael Malice's case, it's very likely that we'll find out something different. Curtis is an acquaintance of mine because he hangs around with some people that I know. I did not get it. I've started to understand why the people in my life, some of them are Curtis Yarvin fans. Many of them disregard the stupid stuff. But my feeling is, is that too much poison organ, not enough fish. I don't know how to serve that too intermingled. I'm not your chef. Speaking for defending your friends, staying with your friends, and bringing the old band together again, you coined the term IDW, Intellectual Dark Web. I like it. It represents a certain group of people that are struggling with, that are almost like a challenge, the norms of social and political discourse from all different angles. What do you think is the state of the IDW? What do you think is its future? Is it still a useful- Well, it never exists. Is it a protocol? Is it a collection of people featured in an article? What I learned very clearly is, is that there's a tremendous desire in the internet age to pin people down. Well, what do you say? Who's in it? What are the criteria? It's like, I understand. You wanna play the demarcation game and you wanna make everything that is demarcated instantly null and void. No, thank you. So, I resisted saying who was in it. I resisted saying what it was. I resisted saying that Barry Weiss's article was the definitive thing. They chose a ridiculous concept for the photographs that we couldn't get out of. I did not want those photographs taken. They decided that the Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer needed to take them all at twilight, I don't know, some such thing. I didn't even necessarily wanna do the article. Barry convinced me that it was the right thing to do. Undoubtedly, Barry was right. I was wrong. But the key point is, nothing can grow in this environment. There's a reason we're not building. It does not appear that we found a way to grow anything organic and good and decent that we need right now. And that's kind of the key issue. Who's the we? Do you mean us as a society? Those of us who wish to have a future for our great-grandchildren. Let's take the subset of people who are worried about things long after their demise. But do you think it's useful to have a term like the IDW to capture some set of people, some set of ideas or maybe principles that capture what I think the IDW, okay, you can say it's not supposed to mean, it doesn't exist, it doesn't mean anything, but to the public, to me, okay, I'll just speak to me, it represented something. Yeah. It represented, I think I just said this to you, is my, in my first attempt to interview the great Eric Weinstein, I said that, I spoke this about you, but IDW in general is trying to point out the elephant in the room or that the emperor has no clothes. The set of people that do that in their own way. If there are multiple elephants in the room. Yes. The point is, is that the IDW was more interested in seeing the totality of elephants and trying to figure out how do we move forward as opposed to saying, I can spot the other guy's elephant in the room, but I can't see my own. And in large measure, we didn't represent an institutional base and therefore it wasn't maximally important that we look at our own hypocrisy because we weren't on the institutional spectrum. This is where friendship comes into play with the different figures that are loosely associated with IDW is you are somehow responsible for, you know, the, the, the exactly thing that you said, did you hear what, I don't know, I forget if it's a Dame, oh, what Sam Harris said about IDW. Yeah. That kind of thing is. Well, I chuckled. Lovingly or chuckled like, or. I was angry at some people who had said things that caused Sam to say what Sam said about turning his imaginary club membership into the IDW. People said very silly things and, you know, I think that there is just this confusion that integrity means calling out your friends in front of the world. And, you know, I've been pretty clear about this. I try to choose my friends carefully and if you would like to recuse me because I'm not a source of reliable information, people that I know and love the most, maybe that's reasonable for you. Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing to throw a friend under the bus at the first sign of trouble. By all means, exit my feed. You don't have to subscribe to me. If that's your concept of integrity, you're barking up the wrong tree. What I will say is that I knew these people well enough to know that they're all flawed. Thank you for the call back. But the issue is that I love people who are flawed and I love people who have to earn a living, even if you call them a grifter. And I love people who, you know, like the fact that Donald Trump didn't get us into new wars, even if you call them alt-right. I love the fact that some people believe in structural oppression and wanna fight it, even if they're not woke because they don't believe that structural oppression is hiding everywhere. I care and love different people in different ways. And I just, I think that, you know, the overarching thing like, so we're not getting at is that we were sold a bill of goods that you can go through life like an ELISA program with pre-programmed responses. Well, it's what aboutism? It's both sidesism. It's alt-right. It's the loony left. It's campus madness. You know, it's like, okay, why don't you just empty the entire goddamn magazine? All of those pre-recorded snips, now that you've done all of that, now we can have a conversation. Your son put it really well, which is we should in all things resist labels. But we can't deal without labels. We have to generalize. But we also have to keep in mind that just in the way in science, you deal with an effective theory that isn't a fundamental one. In science, most of our theories we consider to be effective theories. If I generalize about Europe, about women, about Christians, those things have to be understood to mean something and not to have their definitions extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all, nor that they're so rigid that their claims that clearly won't bear scrutiny. So, Lex, what do you really wanna talk about? That's always my question to you. That always gets me. That's a good, maybe you are the therapist. But like, you and I could talk about, people love, up until now at least, people have loved listening to the two of us in conversation. And my feeling is that we're not talking about neural nets. We're not talking about geometric unity. And we're not talking about where distributed computing might go. And I don't think that we're really focused on some of the most exciting things we could do to transform education. We're still caught in this world of other people that we don't belong in. I don't belong in the world as it's been created. I'm trying to build a new world. And I'm astounded that the people with the independent means to help build that world are so demotivated that they don't wanna build new structures. And the people who do wanna build new structures seem to be wild-eyed. Wild-eyed, what do you mean by wild-eyed? They're not. I guarantee you that I will get some message in my DMs. It says, hey Eric, I'm a third year chemistry student at South Dakota State and I've got a great idea. I just need funding. I wanna build. They don't have the means. So the people who have the means have become. Or the sophistication. It's like you're looking for somebody who's proven themselves a few times to say, I've got $4 billion behind me that's soft-circled. I wanna figure out what a new university would be and what it would take to protect academic freedom and who we would hire and what are the different characteristics because I can clearly see that everything following the current model is falling apart. Nobody in my understanding is saying that. Nobody is saying let's take that which is functioning independently and make it less vulnerable. Let's boost those signals. And a critical component has money, you think? It's not only that, but it's also a kind of these people are mobbed up hands off. Let's imagine for the moment that Sundar Pichai, Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg founded a university come social media entity. And they said the purpose of this is to make sure that academic freedom will not perish from this earth because it's necessary to keep us from all going crazy. We are going to lock ourselves out. We've come up with this governance system. And the idea is that these people will be assigned the difficult task of making sure that society doesn't go crazy in any particular direction. That we have a fact-based, reality-based, feasibility-based understanding. We can try to figure out where our real opportunities are. It feels like everybody with the ability to do something like that and with the brains and experience and the resources would rather sit in the current system and hope to figure out where they can flee to if the whole thing comes apart. Well, yeah, I mean, maybe to push back on a little bit, I agree with you, but it feels like some people are trying that. So for example, Google purchased DeepMind. DeepMind is a company that kind of represents a lot of radical ideas. They've become acceptable actually. AGI, artificial general intelligence, used to be really radical of a thing to talk about and DeepMind and OpenAI are two places which has made it more acceptable. I know you can now start to criticize, well, they're really, now that it's become acceptable, they're not taking the further step of being more and more radical. But that was an attempt by Google to say that let's try some wild stuff. Sort of like Boston Dynamics. Sort of like Boston Dynamics. Boston Dynamics is a really good example of trying radical ideas for perhaps no purpose whatsoever except to try out their ideas. And that the idea is that innovation is like dessert and you can have dessert after you solve the problem of the main course and the main course is a bunch of insoluble problems. So that is we can get into innovation once we perfect ourselves. And you're saying that we need to make innovation the main meal. Well, I'm saying that there really is structural oppression. I mean, if you train a deep learning system on exclusively white faces, it's gonna get confused. So let's not disagree that there are real issues around this. In fact, that's an issue of innovation in data. Your data should be responsive. On the other hand, there are things we can't do anything about that are actually fundamental. And those things may have to do with the fact that some of us taste cilantro as soap and some of us don't. Like there are differences between people and some of them are in the hardware, some of them are in the firmware, some of them are in the software that is the human mind. And this completely simplistic idea that every failure of an organization to promote each person who has particular intersectional characteristics, we cannot hold progress hostage to that. And you've talked about, perhaps we'll save this for another time because it's such a fascinating conversation. You talked about this with Glenn Beck is the whole sort of stagnation of growth and all that kind of stuff. Your idea is that in as much as the current situation is a kind of a Ponzi scheme, the current situation in the United States is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise of constant unending innovation. We need to fund the true innovators and encourage them and empower them and sort of culturally say that this is what this country is about is the brilliant minds. We're gonna kill each other if we don't grow. Growth is like an immune system and you always have pathogens present, but if you don't have growth present, you can't fight the pathogens in your society. And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere. So if we don't get growth into our system fairly quickly, we are in really seriously bad shape. So it's very important that if I had a horrible person who was capable of building something that would give us all a certain amount of what I've called financial beta to some new technology where we all benefit, let's say quantum computing comes in and everybody, the dry cleaner has a quantum computing angle, right? Yes. Okay. That's necessary to keep this system that we built going. We can try to redesign the system, but our system expects growth and we've started starved it for growth and the madness that we're seeing is the failure of our immune system to be able to handle the pathogens that have always been present. So people can say, well, this was always there. Yes, it was. What's changed was your immune system. We have got to make sure that one, we understand why diversity is potentially really important. We have mined certain communities to death. You and I are Ashkenazi Jews. Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews are good at technical stuff. We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff. The Indians have many people who are good at technical stuff as the Japanese. I also believe that we have communities where if you think about the Pareto idea of diminishing returns, if you've never mined a community, many of the people you're gonna get at the beginning are gonna be amazing because that community, it's like, did you drill for more oil in Texas? Texas is pretty thoroughly picked over. Do you find some place that's completely insane? Maybe there's oil there, who knows? In particular, I would like to displace our reliance on our military competitors in Asia in our scientific laboratories with women, with African-Americans, with Latinos, people who are in different categories than we have traditionally sourced. And I would like to get them the money that the market would normally give these fields were we not using visas in place of payment, right? Now, I have a crazy idea, which is that I play, you and I both play music. And I find the analytic work that I do when I'm trying to figure out chord progressions and symmetries and tritones, all these sorts of things, to be very similar to the work that I do when I do physics or math. I believe that one of the things that is true is that the analytic contributions of African-Americans to music are probably fungible to science. I don't know that that's true. It's true, I haven't done controlled research, but I believe that it is very important to let the People's Republic of China know that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore and that we need to look to our own people. And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit for making sure that women, black Americans, Latinos are in a position to take over some of these things because many of these communities have been underutilized. Now, I don't know if that's an insane idea. I wanna hear somebody tell me why it's an insane idea. But I believe that part of what we need to do is we need to recognize that there are security issues, there are geopolitical issues with the funding of science. And that what we've done is we've starved our world for innovation. And if we don't get back to the business of innovation, we should be doing diversity and inclusion out of greed rather than guilt. Now, part of the problem with this is that a lot of the energy behind diversity and inclusion is based on guilt and accusation. And what I want, I wanna kick ass. And my hope is that diminishing returns favors mining the communities that have not been traditionally mined in order to extract output from those communities, unless there's a flaw in that plan. If there's a flaw, somebody needs to tell me. If there isn't a flaw, we need to get greedy about innovation rather than guilty about innovation. That's really brilliantly put. My biggest problem with what I see is it exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity. It's used when it's grounded in guilt, it's then used as a hammer to shame people that don't care about diversity enough. F that shit, okay? So my point is, I'm excited about the idea of Jimi Hendrix doing quantum field theory. I'm excited about the idea of Art Tatum trying to figure out what the neural nets figured out about protein folding. I have some idea of the level of intellect of people who have not found their way into STEM subjects in incredibly technically demanding areas. And if there's a flaw in that theory, I want somebody to present the flaw. But right now, my belief is that these things are merit-based. And if you really believe in structural oppression, you do not want an affirmative action program. You wanna make sure that people have huge amounts of resources to get themselves into position. I wanna push out, I just tried this on this Clubhouse application. I wanna push out Klein bottles as a secret sign inside of rap videos and hip hop, right? I want people to have an idea that there's an amazing world. And I wanna get the people who hopefully I'm trying to lure into science and engineering, I want to get them paid. I don't want them as the cheap substitutes for the fleeing white males who've learned that they can't make any money in science and engineering. So the problem is that we need to take over the ship, Lex. And it doesn't need to be you and me because quite honestly, I have no desire to administer. I don't wanna be the chief executive officer of anything. What I do want is I want the baby boomers who've made this mess and can't see it to be gone. They had almost all of our universities and I want fresh blood, fresh resources. I want academic freedom and I want greed for our country and for the future to determine diversity inclusion as opposed to shame and guilt, which is destroying our fabric. That's as good of a diversity statement as I've ever heard. This is a U-turn, but somebody commented on the tweet you sent that as one of the top comments, they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency. So it's a U-turn, but not really. Okay. Since you're an economist, since you're deep, not an economist. I mean, I pretend to be an economist, hoping that the economists will take issue that I'm not an economist so that I can advance gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics, which the economics profession has failed to acknowledge was a major innovation that happened approximately 25 years ago. I don't think that economists understand what a price index is that measures inflation, nor do I think economists understand what a growth index or a product, a quantity index is. That measures GDP. I think that they don't even understand the basics of price and quantity index construction. And therefore, they can't possibly review field theoretic economics. They can't review gauge theoretic economics. They're intellectually not in a position to manage their own field. You talked about that there's a stagnation in growth currently. I looked at, from my microeconomics, macroeconomics and college perspective, GDP doesn't seem to capture the productivity, the full, the spectrum of what I think is as a functioning, successful society. What do you think is broken about GDP? What does it need to include at these indices? Let me explain what they don't understand to begin with. Sure. Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output are the same at the end of a year as they are at the beginning. And you ask what happened during that year. Was there inflation? They meandered over the course of the year, but miraculously, they all came back to exactly their values. The amount produced at the end of the year is the same as at the beginning in every single quantity. Typically, the claim would be that the price index should be 1.0 and that the quantity index should be 1.0. That's clearly wrong. Why? Well, it's much easier to see with, it speaks to a fundamental confusion that economists have. They don't understand that the economy is curved and not flat. In a curved economy, everything should be path-dependent, but they view path dependence as a problem because they are effectively the flat earth society of market analysis. They don't understand that what they've called, and they've actually called it the cycling problem, is exactly what they need to understand to advance their field. So I'll give you a very simple example, okay? Let's imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund and Ted and Alice in another. In both cases, the females, that is Alice and Carol, are the chief investment officers, and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers in charge of trying to get money into the fund and trying to get people not to, in fact, remove their money from the funds, okay? If you, in fact, had Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, and both hedge funds were invested in assets whose prices came back to the same levels and whose exposures were in the same quantities, and you wanted to compensate these two hedge funds, would you compensate them the same, necessarily? What if, for example, Carol, who is the chief investment officer, for example, Carol was killing it in terms of investments. Every time she bought some sort of security, the price of that security went up, okay? But Bob was the worst marketing officer, and as chief marketing officer, there were tons of redemptions because Bob was constantly drunk, Bob was making off-color comments. Now, as a result, at the end of the year, it hasn't grown in size because even though Carol was crushing it in terms of the investments, Bob was screwing up everything and the redemptions were legendary. So people were making money and still pulling it out of the fund. In the other fund, Alice can't seem to buy a base hit every time she gets into a security, the thing plummets, but Ted's amazing marketing skills allowed the fund to get all sorts of new subscriptions and halted the redemptions as people hoped that the fund would get its act together. Okay. Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated. And quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted are compensated. So even though both funds had closed loops that come back to the original states, what happened during the period that they were active tells you how people are supposed to be compensated. Now we know that whatever the increase in the price index is, is compensated by a decrease in the quantity index or conversely, because prices and quantities return to their original values. You could have another fund where nothing much happened, there were no redemptions, no subscriptions, the fund remained in cash the whole time. So in that third fund, let's call that Tristan and Isolde, that fund should have no bonuses paid because nobody did anything, but nobody should be fired either. Now, the fact that the economists don't even understand that this is what their price and quantity indices were intended to do, that they don't understand that you can actually give what would be called ordinal agents, the freedom to change their preferences and still have something defined as a CONUS cost of living adjustment. They don't even understand the mathematics of their field. So the indices need to be able to capture some kind of dynamics that... We have had indices that capture these dynamics due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925, but the economists have not even understood what de Vizier's index truly represent. What do you miss with such crude indices then? Well, you miss the fact that you're supposed to have a field theoretic subject. The representative consumer should actually be a probability distribution on the space of all possible consumers weighted by the probability of getting any particular pull from the distribution. We should not have a single gauge of inflation. What is that in 1973 dollars, any more than you should be able to sell? It's not possible to say it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday. So when we get to the cryptocurrency, what I'm going to say is that because we didn't found economic theory on the proper marginal revolution, because we missed the major opportunity, which is that the differential calculus of markets is gauge theory. It's not ordinary differential calculus. We found out in finance that it was stochastic differential calculus. We have the wrong version of the differential calculus underneath all of modern economic theory. And part of what I've been pushing for in cryptocurrencies is the idea that we should be understanding that gold is a gauge theory, just as modern economic theory is supposed to be a gauge theory. And that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies and more importantly, distributed computing from the problem of this unwanted global aspect, which is the blockchain. The thing that is most celebrated in some sense about Bitcoin is in fact the reason that I'm least enthusiastic about it. I'm hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did, but it's an intermediate step towards trying to figure out what should digital gold actually be. If physical gold is a collection of up quirks and down quirks in the form of protons and nucleons, protons and neutrons held together, the quirks by gluons with electrons orbiting it held together by photons with the occasional weak interaction beta decay. All of those are gauge theories. So gold is actually coming from gauge theory and markets are coming from gauge theory. And the opportunity to do locally enforced conservation laws which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is, should theoretically be founded on a different principle that is not the blockchain. It should be a gauge theoretic concept in which effectively the tokens are excitations on a network of computer nodes. And the fact that let's imagine that this is some token. By moving it from my custodianship to your custodianship, effectively I pushed that glass as a gauge theory towards your region of the table. We should be recognizing the gauge theory is the correct differential calculus for the 21st century. In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century. You're saying it captures these individual dynamics. Why should my giving you a token have to be, why should we alert the global community in this token that that occurred? You can talk about side change, you can talk about any means of doing this. But effectively we have a problem which is if I think about this differently, I have a glass that is extant. You have a glass that is abstinent. We're supposed to call the constructor method on your glass at the same moment we call the destructor method on my glass in order to have a conservation principle. It would be far more efficient to do this with the one system that is known never to throw an exception, which is nature. And nature has chosen gauge theory and geometry for her underlying language. We now know due to work of Pia Malani at Harvard in economics in the mid 1990s, which I was her coauthor on, but I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea. We know that modern economic theory is a naturally occurring gauge theory. And the failure of that community to acknowledge that that work occurred and that it was put down for reasons that make no analytic sense is important in particular due to the relatively new innovation of distributed computing and Satoshi's brainchild. So you're thinking we need to have the mathematics that captures, that enforces cryptocurrency as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized one where the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized. The abundance economy, much discussed in Silicon Valley or what's left of it, is actually a huge threat to the planet because what it really is is that it is what Mark Andreessen has called software eating the world. And what that means is that you're gonna push things from being private goods and services into public goods and services. And public goods and services cannot have price and value tied together. Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value to the world that they cannot command a price and they will not be able to capture the value that they have created or a significant enough fraction of it. The abundance economy is a disaster. It will lead to a reduction in human freedom. The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced or semi-locally enforced conservation laws where the idea is just as gold is hard, why is gold hard to create or destroy? It's because it's created not only in stars but in violent events involving stars like supernovae or collisions. When gold is created and we transact, we're using conservation laws. The physics determines the custodianship, whatever it is that I don't have, you now have, and conversely. In such a situation, we should be looking for the abstraction that most closely matches the physical world because the physical world is known not to throw an exception. The blockchain is a vulnerability. The idea that the 51% problem isn't solved, that you could have crazy race conditions, all of these things. We know that they're solved inside of gauge theory somehow. So the important thing is to recognize that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever in the history of economic theory took place already and was essentially instantly buried. And I will stand by those comments. Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you. Are you Satoshi? No. No, no, no, I don't have that kind of ability. I really don't. I do other things. Speaking of Satoshi and gauge theory, you've mentioned to Brian Keating that you may be releasing a geometric community paper. This here is some other form of additional material in the topic. What is your thinking around this? What's the process you're going through now in preparing this? I used April 1st to try to start a tradition, which I hope to use to liberate mankind. The tradition is that at least one day a year, you should be able to say heretical things and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off or Mark Zuckerberg. Your provost shouldn't call you up and say, what did you say? We need at some level to have a jubilee from centralized control. And so my hope is that, you know what a tradition is in America? Something a baby boomer did twice. Impeachment? That's very funny. Anyway, so I'm not a baby boomer, but as an exer, I've thought about whether or not April 1st would be a good date on which to release a printed version of what I already said in lecture form, because I think it's hysterically funny that the physics community claims that it can't decode a lecture. Yeah. It must be paper. And you know what? There will be a steady stream of new complaints up until the point that they fit it into a narrative that they like. Yeah, I'm thinking about April 1st as a date in which to release a document and it won't be perfectly complete, but it'll be very complete. And then they'll try to say, it's wrong or you already did it or no, that was dumb, but what we just did on top of it is brilliant or it doesn't match experiment or who knows what? They'll go through all of their usual nonsense. It's time to go. Is there still puzzles in your own mind that need to be figured out for you to try to put it on paper? I mean, those are different mediums, right? That's a great question. I did not count on something that turns out to be important. When you work on your own outside of the system for a long time, you probably don't think you're gonna be doing this as a 55-year-old man. And I have been so long outside of math and physics departments and I've been occupied with so many other things as you can see, that the old idea that I had was if I always did it in little pieces, then I was always safe because it wouldn't be stealable. And so now those pieces never got assembled completely. In essence, I have all the pieces and I can fit them together, but there's probably a small amount of glue code. Like there are a few algebraic things I've forgotten how to do. I may or may not figure them out between now and April 1st, but it's pretty complete. But that's the puzzle you're kind of struggling to now figure out, to get it all on the same, the glue together. I can't tell you whether the theory is correct or incorrect. But like, you know, for example, is what's the exact form of the supersymmetry algebra or what's the rule for passing a minus sign through a particular operator? And all of that stuff got a lot more difficult because I didn't do it every, look, you know, it's a little bit like, if you're a violinist and you don't touch your violin regularly for 15 years, you come back to it and you pretty much know the pieces sort of, but there's lots of stuff that's missing, your tone is off and that kind of stuff. I would say I'll get the ship to the harbor and it'll require a tugboat probably to get it in. And if the tugboat doesn't show up, then I'll pilot the thing right into the dock myself, but it's not a big deal. I think that it is essentially complete. Psychologically, just as a human being, this is, I remember perhaps by accident, but maybe there's no accidents in the universe. I was tuned in, I don't remember where, on April 1st to you, oh, I think in your Discord, kind of thinking about, thinking through this release. I mean, it wasn't like, it wasn't obvious that you were going to do it, you were thinking through it. And I remember there was intellectual, personal, psychological struggle with this, right? Well, cause I thought it was dangerous. If this turns out to be right, I don't know what it unlocks. If it's wrong, I think I understand where we are. If it's wrong, it'll be the first fool's gold that really looks like a theory of everything. It'll be the iron pyrites of physics. And we haven't even had fool's gold in my opinion yet. Got it. So what is your intuition why this looks right to you? Like why it feels like it would be if wrong. I can say it very simply. It's way smarter than I am. Can you break that apart a little more? Like every time you poke at it, it's giving you intuitions that follow with the currently known physics. Let's put it in computer science terms. Yes, please. Okay. There's a concept of technical debt that computer scientists struggle with. As you commit crimes, you have to pay those crimes back at a later date. In general, most of the problems with physical theories is that as you try to do something that matches reality, you usually have to go into some structure that gets you farther away. And your hope is that you're gonna be able to pay back the technical debt. And in general, these wind up as check-kiting schemes. Or like you're funding a startup and there are too many pivots. So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover things that have gone wrong. My belief is that this thing represents something like a summit to me. And I'm very proud of having found a route up this summit. But the route is what's due to me. The summit can't possibly be due to me. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay did not create Mount Everest. They know that they didn't create that. They figured out a way up. You gotta tell me what Mount Everest is in this metaphor relative and also connected to the technical debt. So technical debt is a negative thing that you will eventually have to pay it. You're saying in the ascent that you're seeing now in the theory is you do not have much technical debt. Well, that's right. I think that what happens is that early on, what I would say is I believe now that the physics community has said many things incorrectly about the current state of the universe. They're not wildly off, which is why, like for example, the claim is that there are three generations of matter. I do not believe that there are three generations of matter. I believe that there are two generations of matter and there's a third collection that looks like a generation of matter as the first two only at low energy. Okay, well, that's not a frequent claim. People imagine that there are three or more generations of matter. I would claim that that's false. People claim that the matter is chiral, that is, it knows it's left from its right. I would claim that the chirality is not fundamental, but it is emergent. We could keep going at all these sorts of things. People think that spacetime is the fundamental geometrical construct. I do not agree. I think it's something that I've termed the observers. All of these different things represent a series of overinterpretations of the world that preclude progress. So you gave, I think you gave some credit to string theory as, string theory, and I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly, as like getting close to the fool's gold. Well, I've said that Garrett Leesey, Garrett Leesey. phenomenologically, gets a lot of things right. He gets, he's got a reason for chirality, a reason for uniqueness using E8. And the fact that E8 uses something called vile fermions, which are chiral. He has a way of getting geometry to get Riemann's geometry underneath general relativity to play with Erisman's geometry, which is underneath the standard model, using something called Cartan connections that are out of favor. He's figured out something involving super connections to make sure that the fermion, the matter in the system isn't quantized the same way as the bosons were, which is a problem in his old theory. He's got something about three generations for trial. He's got a lot of phenomenological hits. I don't think Garrett's theory works. It also has a very simple Lagrangian. He's basically using the Yang-Mills norm squared, the same thing you would use as a cost function if you were doing neural nets, okay? The string theorists have a different selling point, which is that they may have gotten a renormalizable theory of gravity, if quantum gravity was what we were talking about. They may have gotten a renormalizable theory of gravity, if quantum gravity was what we were meant to do. And they've done some stuff with black holes that they can get some solutions correct. And then they have lots of agreements with where they show mathematical truths that mathematicians didn't even know. I'm very underwhelmed by string theory based on how many people have worked on it and how little is supporting the claims to it being a theory of everything. And I think that's a really interesting thing and I like to think of it as a theory of everything. And I think it would be a really interesting thing if it were a theory of everything. And I think that's an interesting thing. I don't think I'm taking Wolfram's quite seriously. I don't yet take Wolfram's quite seriously because if he really finds one of these cellular automata that are really distinct and generative, it'll be amazing. But he's looking for such a thing. I don't think he's found anything. not positive, the mathematical universe hypothesis is really anything new. And in general, loop quantum gravity really, I think grew out of some hopes that the general relativistic community had for, that they would be able to do particle theory. I don't think that they've shown any particle theoretic realism. So essentially, here's what I really think, Lex. I think we didn't understand how big the difference between an effective theory and a theory of everything is conceptually. Maybe it's not mathematically that different, but conceptually, trying to figure out what a theory of every, how does the universe, and I've compared it to Escher's drawing hands, how do two hands draw themselves into existence? That's the puzzle that I think has just been wanting. And I'll be honest, I'm really surprised that the theoretical physics community didn't even get up on their high horse and say, this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable, because clearly, I always say I'm not a physicist. So I'm an amateur with a heart as big as all outdoors. So in your journey of releasing this, and I'm sure there further, maybe it will be another American tradition on April 1st that will continue for years to come. I hope so. There's sort of crumbs along the way that I'm hoping to collect in my naive view of things of the beauty that, in your geometric view of the universe. So one question I'd like to ask is, if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful, something important about geometric unity in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty from the outsider's perspective, what would that thing be? Interesting question. Perhaps we can both have a journey towards April 1st. Yeah. Take a look at that. Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose, not Melrose, on Montana in Santa Monica. Now you'll notice that all of those disks rotate independently. Yes. If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous, but not uniform everywhere, what you're doing is a so-called gauge transformation on the torus seen as a U1 bundle over a U1 spacetime. So the concept of spacetime here in a very simplified case isn't four dimensional, but it's one dimensional. It's just a circle. And there's a circle above every point in the circle represented by those little disks. Imagine if you will, that we took a rubber band and placed it around here and decided that that was a function from the circle into this circle that is representing a Y axis that's wrapped around itself. Well, you would have an idea of what it means for a function to be constant if it just went all around the outside. But what happens if I turn this a little bit, then the function would be mostly constant. It would have a little place where it dipped and it went back. It turns out that you can transform that function and transform the derivative that says that function is equal to zero when I take its derivative at the same time. That's what a gauge transformation is. Amazing to me that we don't have a simple video visualizing things that I've already had built and that I can clearly demonstrate. When you do that torus, who the code of the torus is itself generating a spinning torque. This is a U1 principle bundle. And the world needs to know what a gauge theory is, not by analogy, not with Lawrence Krauss saying, it's like a checkerboard. If you change some of the colors this way, not saying that it's a, it's a local symmetry involving, it's none of those things. It's a theory of differential calculus where the functions and the derivatives are both subject to a particular kind of change so that if a function was constant under one derivative, then the new function is constant under the new derivative transformed in the same fashion. And would you put that under the category of just gauge transformations? Yes, that would be gauge transformations applied to sections and connections where connections are the derivatives in the theory. This is easily explained. It is pathological that the community of people who understand what I'm saying have never bothered to do this in a clear fashion for the general public. You and I could visualize this overnight. This is not hard. The public needs to know in some sense that let's say quantum electrodynamics, the theory of photons and electrons, more or less electrons are functions and photons are derivatives. Now there's some, you can object in some ways, but basically a gauge theory is the way in which you can translate a shift in the definition of the functions and the shift of the definition of the derivatives so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed. So you have to do both at the same time. Now you and I can visualize that. So if what you wanted to do, rather than going directly to geometric unity, is that I could sit down with you and I could say, here are the various components of geometric unity. And if the public needs a visualization in order to play along, we've got a little over two months and I'd be happy to work with you. I love that as a challenge and I'll take it on and I hope we do make it happen. And David Goggins, if Lex doesn't do some super macho thing because he's got to work to get some of this stuff done, you'll understand he'll be available to you after April. Thank you for the escape clause. I really needed that escape clause. I'm glad that's on record. I'm worried 48 miles in 48 hours. By the way, I just want to say how much I admire your willingness to keep this kind of hardcore attitude. I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews have it in spades, but it's harder to do in a society that's sloppy and that's weak and that's lazy. And the fact that you bring so much heart to saying, I'm going to bring this to jujitsu, I'm going to bring this to guitar, I'm going to bring this to AI, I'm going to bring this to podcasting. It comes through loud and clear. And I just find it completely and utterly inspiring that you keep this kind of hardcore aspect at the same time that you're the guy who's extolling the virtue of love in a modern society and doing it at scale. Thank you. That means a lot. I don't know why I'm doing it, but I'm just following my heart on it and just going with the gut. It seems to make sense somehow. I personally think we better get tougher or we're going to get in a world of pain. And I do think that when it comes time to lead, it's great to have people who you know don't crack under pressure. Do you mind if we talk about love and what it takes to be a father for a bit? Sure. Do you mind if Zev joins us? It would be an honor. So, Eric, I've talked to your son Zev, who's an incredible human being, but let me ask you, this might be difficult because you're both sitting together, what advice do you have for him as he makes his way in this world, especially given that, as we mentioned before on Joe Rogan, you're flawed in that just like all humans, you're mortal? Well, at some level, I guess, one of my issues is that I've got to stop giving quite so much advice. Early on, I was very worried that I could see Zev's abilities and I could see his challenges, and I saw them in terms of myself. So a certain amount of Zev rhymes with whatever I went through as a kid, and I don't want to doom him to the same outcomes that sufficed for me. I think that he's got a much better head on his shoulders at age 15, he's much better adjusted, and in part, it's important for me to recognize that because I think I did a reasonably decent job early on, I don't need to get this part right. And I'm looking at Zev's trajectory and saying, you're going to need to be incredibly, even pathologically self-confident. The antidote for that is going to be something you're going to need to carry on board, which is radical humility. And you're going to have to have those in a dialectical tension, which is never resolved, which is a huge burden. You are going to have to forgive people who do not appreciate your gifts because your gifts are clearly evident, and many people will have to pretend not to see them because if they see your gifts, then they're going to have to question their entire approach to education or employment or critical thinking. And what my hope is, is that you can just forgive those who don't see them and who complicate and frustrate your life and realize that you're going to have to take care of them too. Zev, let me ask you the more challenging question because the guy sitting right here, what advice do you have for your dad? Since after talking to you, I realize you're the more brilliant, aside from the better-looking member of the family. Um... It's a bit of an odd question. Sorry. You can say anything you want. This is the last time we're going to be seeing Liff. This could be an awkward drive home. I think sort of a new perspective I've taken on parenting is that it is a task for which no human is really supposed to be prepared. You know, there are... In Jewish tradition, for example, there are myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud that compare the role of a parent to the role of a god, right? No human is prepared to play god and create and guide a life, but somehow we're forced into it as people. And I think sometimes it's hard for children to understand that however their parents are failing... Sort of has to be. It's a theme here....is something for which we must budget because our parents play a role in our lives of which they're not worthy and they devote themselves to regardless because that becomes who they are in a certain sense. So I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human because I think too often it's easy to have godly expectations of people who are far from such a role. And I think I'm really happy that you've been as open as you have with me about the fact that, you know, you really... You don't pretend to be a god in my life. You are a guide who allows me to see myself, and that's been very important considering the fact that by your self-teaching paradigm, I will have to guide myself and being able to see it and see myself accurately has been one of the greatest gifts that you've given me. So I'm very appreciative. And I want you to know that I don't buy into the role that you're supposed to... sort of fake your way through in my life, but I am unbelievably happy with a more realistic connection that we've been able to build in lieu of it. I think it's been easier on you actually as you come to realize what I don't know, what I can't do, and that there's been a period of time, I guess, that's fascinated to me where you're sort of surprised that I don't know the answer to a certain thing as well as you do, and that I remember going through this with a particular mathematician who I held, and I still hold in awe, named David Kajdan. And he famously said to him, and weirdly our family knew his family in the Soviet Union, but he said, you know, Eric, I always appreciate you coming to my office because I always find what you have to say interesting, but you have to realize that in the areas that you're talking about, you are no longer the student, you are actually my teacher. And I wasn't prepared to hear that. And there are many ways in which, as I was just saying with the Mozart, I am learning at an incredible rate from you. I used to learn from you because I didn't understand what was possible. You were very much, I mean, this is the weird thing. There used to be this thing called Harvey the invisible rabbit. This guy had a rabbit that was like six feet tall that only he could see maybe was talking. And that was like you at age four, as you were saying a batch of crazy things that were all totally sensible, and nobody else could put them together. And so what's wonderful is that the world hasn't caught on, but enormous numbers of people are starting to. And I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit and that outside the box intellectual commitment serves you well as the world starts to appreciate that I think you're a very trustworthy voice. You don't get everything right, but the idea that we have somebody at your age who's embedded in your generation who can tell us something about what's happening is really valuable to me. And I do hope that you'll consider boosting that voice more than just at the dinner table. I apologize for saying this four-letter word, but do you love Zev? I was really worried it was going to be another four-letter word. There's so many. It doesn't even rise to the level of a question. I mean, I just \u2013 there are a tiny number of people with whom you share so much life that you can't even think of yourself in their absence. And I don't know if Zev would find that, but you can have a kid and never make this level of connection. I think even right down to the fact that when Zev chooses boogie-woogie piano for his own set of reasons why I would choose boogie-woogie piano if I could play in any style, it's a question about a decrease in loneliness. Like my grandfather played the mandolin, and I had to learn some mandolin because otherwise that instrument would go silent. You don't expect that you get this much of a chance to leave this much of yourself in another person who is choosing it and recreating it rather than it being directly instilled. And my proudest achievement is in a certain sense having not taught him and having shared this much. So, you know, it's not even love. It's like well beyond. So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world. I think I speak for, I would argue, probably millions of people that you, Eric, because this is a conversation with you, have made for many people, for me, a less lonely world. And I can't wait to see how you, Zev, develop as an intellect. But also I'm so heart-worn by the optimism and the hopefulness that was in you that I hope develops further. And lastly, I'm deeply thankful that you, Eric, are my friend and would give me, would honor me with this watch. It means more than words can say. Thanks, guys. Thanks for talking today. Thank you.

{"text":"It gives me extreme pleasure \nto extend my congratulations to Mr. Miguel d\u2019Escoto \nBrockmann on his election. I read with keen interest \nthe United Nations news report of His Excellency\u2019s \nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \nsixty-third session. I note well what he said on 4 June \nthis year, following his election (see A\/62\/PV.99): for \n  \n \n08-52272 6 \n \nthe United Nations to be more effective, it must be \nwhat its name implies \u2014 an organization of nations \nunited, not nations dispersed or, even worse, \nsubjugated. Our nations must be united in the struggle \nto democratize the United Nations, united in their \ndetermination to preserve the world for the sake of \npresent and future generations from the scourge of war \namong Member States, and from acts of aggression.  \n I congratulate him and the Vice-Presidents on \ntheir election to lead the General Assembly. I believe \nthat Mr. d\u2019Escoto Brockmann\u2019s election, as a leader in \nhis own right, as a Christian priest and as a God-\nfearing servant of the Republic of Nicaragua, to the \npresidency of the Assembly is timely in these \nchallenging days. \n May I also extend my appreciation to His \nExcellency Mr. Srgjan Kerim for his successful leadership \nof the General Assembly at its sixty-second session. \n I am deeply honoured to be the first President of \nthe Republic of Vanuatu to address this Assembly, \nsince it is the first time that a Head of State of Vanuatu \nhas attended the United Nations since our admission to \nthe Organization in 1981. In this respect, please allow \nme also to extend my congratulations to the Secretary-\nGeneral on his appointment and on his keen \ncommitment to revitalizing the United Nations. \n I am humbled and privileged to stand before the \nsixty-third General Assembly to share some words and \nthoughts on behalf of the people of Vanuatu. Twenty-\nseven years ago, on 15 September 1981, Vanuatu \nbecame the 155th Member of the United Nations \nfamily. On that same day, our first and longest-serving \nPrime Minister and the founding father of our nation \u2014 \nthe late doctor, chief and priest, Father Walter Hadye \nLini \u2014 spoke to the Assembly in the name of the \npeople of Vanuatu, with pride, humility and gratitude. \nHe acknowledged the support of the United Nations \nthrough the active concern and assistance of the \nSpecial Committee of 24 on Decolonization.  \n Father Lini said that, because of that, the United \nNations has a very special place in the affections and \nesteem of the people of Vanuatu. He also expressed our \nnation\u2019s debt of gratitude to a great number of the \ncountries represented in the Assembly, which assisted \nour nation\u2019s difficult progress towards independence. \n In the same spirit I call on the United Nations to \ncontinue to pursue the interests of those countries and \npeoples that continue their struggle for freedom and to \nwin a permanent place among us. The United Nations \nis the Organization of the family of independent \nsovereign nations and peoples of the world. It must \nstand firm to promote peace, security and equality \nthroughout the world.  \n The world\u2019s majority has accepted the \nphenomenon of climate change as a reality and no \nlonger an academic theory. From Kyoto to Bali, that \nobservation has been consistently repeated. \n The increase in the occurrence of natural \ncalamities and their destructive powers are a stark \nreminder of the increasing vulnerability of today\u2019s \nglobal environment, where nature respects no \nboundaries. The severe impact of natural disasters will \nconstantly remind us of the harsh experiences and \ncritical development challenges confronting many of \nthe island countries. \n I join my colleagues from the Pacific region in \nour call to the international community for more \nconcerted action in addressing climate change as a \nsecurity issue. Unless the present trend of global \nwarming is reversed through sincere and concerted \ninternational action through the United Nations \nframework, some of our Pacific colleague nations will \nbe submerged. If such a tragedy should happen, then \nthe United Nations and its members will have failed in \ntheir first and most basic duty to a Member and its \ninnocent people, as stated in Article 1 of the Charter of \nthe United Nations. \n In 2003, Vanuatu\u2019s economic growth rebounded \nto 3.2 per cent from -2.6 per cent and -7.4 per cent in \n2001 and 2002 respectively. Continued growth was \nrecorded in 2004 and 2005, with a published growth \nrate of 5.5 per cent and 6.8 per cent respectively, \ndriven mainly by growth in the service sector and, in \nparticular, tourism. \n As members know, a dimension of the least \ndeveloped country (LDC) status is the tri-annual \nreview by the Economic and Social Council of the list \nof least developed countries with the view to \nrecommending countries for graduation out of or \ninclusion in the group of least developed countries. It \nis in that regard that I wish to bring to the attention of \nour Assembly to an area of serious concern to the \nGovernments of Vanuatu and of several other small \nisland developing States of the Pacific. \n \n \n7 08-52272 \n \n It is our view that the current graduation rule \nposes a systemic issue that could easily be resolved if \nMember States were willing to recognize its \nimportance to countries such as Vanuatu and other \nPacific nations. The decision to graduate a country \nfrom LDC status, in our view, must imply the \nrecognition of undisputed sustainable socio-economic \nprogress in the country. The criteria the United Nations \nrelies on to arrive at a decision are by and large sound \nand fair, and I will briefly recall them: first, one \nexpects the country to enjoy a higher income per \ncapita; secondly, the country\u2019s human assets or human \ncapital is expected to have made significant progress; \nand thirdly, the country ought to have achieved greater \nresilience to external shocks \u2014 in other words, to have \nbecome less vulnerable economically. \n A country is recommended for graduation if it \nmeets any two of those three criteria. In other words, \nthe graduation rule implicitly postulates that all three \ncriteria are equally important. If a country, no matter \nhow vulnerable, has risen to a level of per capita \nincome above $900, which is not difficult in a small \nState, and enjoys improved human capital, it is \nassumed that that country has become structurally \nstronger and is now ready to pursue its development \nefforts without LDC treatment. \n Vanuatu and other Pacific countries believe it is \ncritical to recognize the vulnerability criterion as the \nparamount criterion and accordingly give it \nprominence. It is indeed the only criterion that \nultimately matters to small and vulnerable States such \nas ours. \n Vanuatu and other Pacific countries are deemed \neligible for graduation on the basis of their improved \nper capita income and improved human assets. They \nremain among the most vulnerable countries in the \nworld, both economically and environmentally, and \nthat must be recognized by the United Nations. Our \ncountries may graduate from LDC status because they \nhave achieved a higher per capita income performance, \neven though the sustainability of that income is \nconstantly challenged by the high vulnerability of \nisland economies to shocks such as frequent cyclones, \nearthquakes, volcanic eruptions and sea-level rise. \n The recent hurricanes in this part of the world \nremind us of the destructive impact that such natural \nphenomena have on the development process of island \ncountries and LDCs. Members may be aware that the \n\u201cisland paradox\u201d \u2014 when relative prosperity \novershadows high vulnerability \u2014 continues to be \ndisregarded, despite the repeated call for a reform of \nthe graduation rule that would make low vulnerability \na sine qua non or compulsory criterion. \n This is not the first time that Vanuatu, in \naddressing the Assembly, has called on the United \nNations to reform the way least developed countries \nare identified. Some 11 years ago, in 1997, a former \nPrime Minister called for an urgent review of the LDC \ngraduation criteria, which brought the United Nations \nto introduce a vulnerability criterion, a fair and sound \nmove on the part of the Organization. \n I reiterate Vanuatu\u2019s plea for a reform of the \ngraduation rule and wish to point out that the reform \nwe are calling for is a mild and reasonable one, one \nthat could easily be adopted by the Economic and \nSocial Council and the General Assembly without \naltering the main components of the established \nmethodology. We believe the time has come for the \nUnited Nations to come full circle by making the same \ncriterion a superior one, so that no highly vulnerable \ncountry is forcibly reclassified and bound to lose the \nlevel of concessionary support of which it remains in \nneed. Such a reform would do justice to countries that \nhave not achieved the implied structural progress. \n We are also urging experts from the Committee \nfor Development Policy to seriously consider the merit \nof undertaking in-country visits to assess first-hand the \ndevelopment experiences of affected countries rather \nthan making conclusions on statistical indicators that \nare anomalous and theoretical. \n In 2004, the Government of Vanuatu established \nits Millennium Development Goals (MDG) National \nCommittee, which adopted a plan of action to \nimplement the MDGs. In its first report, in 2005, the \nMDG National Committee concluded that Vanuatu\u2019s \noutlook for the achievement of the MDGs or their \nrespective targets was poor to fair. That can be \nattributed to poor linkages to Government priorities \nand inadequate allocation of resources to implement \nthe plan of action.  \n Nevertheless, we are pleased to report that in \ncollaboration with the United Nations Development \nProgramme, Vanuatu is endeavouring to put in place \nmechanisms to operationalize its sector strategies by \nidentifying key issues and the  required interventions to \naddress them, and defining the coverage of \n  \n \n08-52272 8 \n \ninterventions and their costing. We believe that, if we \nsucceed in doing that, we will be able to accelerate \nprogress on the MDGs and that, come 2015, Vanuatu \nwill be able to provide a more positive report to the \nAssembly. \n At the Millennium Summit, the then Prime \nMinister of Vanuatu, The Honourable Barak Sope \nMaautamate, called on the United Nations to review \nthe legality of the United Nations action in 1962 to \nendorse the New York Agreement to administer the  \nso-called Act of Free Choice over West Papua. \n The Charter of the United Nations espouses the \nprinciples that continue to guide the Organization\u2019s \nefforts in the process of self-determination. That \nmanifestation calls for recognition and respect for the \nfundamental and inalienable rights of peoples and \nterritories still under colonial rule to determine their \nfuture. We cannot champion democracy if the United \nNations continues to hang this blanket of silence over \nthe case of West Papua, in which the United Nations \nitself takes part. \n An issue of extreme national importance is the \nquestion of submissions to the United Nations on the \nextension of continental shelves. As with some other \nsmaller nations, technical capacity constraints and \nfinancial resources have inhibited our progress on \nsubmissions, and therefore we are requesting that the \nUnited Nations consider extending the deadline for \nsubmissions to enable countries like Vanuatu to \nparticipate fully in the process. We call for the \nunderstanding of our development partners and urge \nthem to consider providing funding for that important \nexercise. \n A side issue to the question of the extension of \ncontinental shelves in relation to Vanuatu is that there \nis a dispute between Vanuatu and the French Republic, \nthe former colonial authority, concerning our \ncontinental shelves to the south of the nation.  \n On the question of reforms at the United Nations, \nwe believe that, in order to make the Organization truly \ndemocratic, reforms are essential to make the Security \nCouncil more representative of the membership as a \nwhole. In that respect, we believe that Japan and India \ndeserve permanent membership. \n At this critical moment of global crisis, I recall \nthe aphorism underpinning the foundations of the \nUnited Nations. It is taken from the book of the great \nprophet Micah and is engraved on the walls of United \nNations Headquarters: \n  \u201cThey shall beat their swords into \nploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. \nNation shall not lift up sword against nation, \nneither shall they learn war any more\u201d (The Holy \nBible, Micah, 4:3). \n It is no coincidence that the theme for this \nAssembly is a much clearer manifestation of those \nprophetic words, which the United Nations has \nneglected over the years. As one of the smallest \nMembers of the United Nations family of nations, \nVanuatu reaffirms its commitment to building global \npeace and security. We also remain committed to \nsupporting United Nations peacekeeping missions as \nour modest contribution to that worthy cause. \n Finally, we welcome 2009 as the International \nYear of Reconciliation. We all hope and pray that it \nwill be a time for real compromises and political \ngoodwill. We encourage all members of our family of \nnations to approach 2009 with open hearts. If we are to \nturn the tide of tension and animosity, we must have \nthe courage to reconcile our differences and come \ntogether in those dimensions that will enhance this \nnoble Organization\u2019s role in peacebuilding and \ndevelopment. \n In closing, I would like to express the \nGovernment of Vanuatu\u2019s gratitude to all our \ndevelopment partners who have generously contributed \nto Vanuatu\u2019s development efforts. In particular, we \nwish to thank Australia, China, the European Union, \nNew Zealand, Japan, the United States of America and \nFrance. We would also like to acknowledge the support \nof other partners, including India, Turkey, South Korea, \nMalaysia, Indonesia and Canada, as well as such \nmultilateral institutions as the World Bank and the \nAsian Development Bank, and other United Nations \nagencies. \n Mr. Baugh (Jamaica), Vice-President, took the \nChair. \n We are living in perilous times.

{"text":"Caregiver burden and its prevalence, measurement scales, predictive factors and impact: a review with an Asian perspective\n\nCaregiver burden is a well-recognised global phenomenon. The primary aim of this review is to summarise the prevalence of caregiver burden and its measurement scales, predictive factors and impact in Singapore. PubMed\u00ae and Scopus\u00ae databases were searched using the key terms \u2018caregiver\u2019, \u2018burden\u2019, \u2018stress\u2019, \u2018strain\u2019 and \u2018Singapore\u2019. A total of 206 papers were retrieved and 20 were included. This review showed that a significant proportion of caregivers in Singapore experience caregiver burden. Caregiving experiences and outcomes are affected by cultural, behavioural and socioeconomic factors. Being a Malay caregiver appears to be a protective factor for caregiver burden, whereas having negative coping strategies and care recipients with functional, cognitive and behavioural impairments are positive risk factors. As for outcomes, caregiver burden is associated with poorer self-rated health and reduced quality of life. Multiple instruments have been used to measure caregiver burden, and the Zarit Burden Interview is the most widely used.\n\nMany instruments for the measurement of caregiver well-being are available, and they cover various domains recommended for inclusion by the Family Caregiver Alliance. [19][20][21] A recent systematic review of tools for measurement of the impact of informal caregiving categorised them according to their degree of integration of dimensions and level of specificity to the caregiving process [ Figure 1], [20] and caregiver burden was found to be the most specific and most integrated. Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), the most widely employed tool to measure caregiver burden, has good test-retest reliability, internal consistency and construct validity. [20][21][22] ZBI is a self-reported caregiver measure that was originally developed by Zarit et al. as a 29-item questionnaire to assess the subjective burden experienced by informal caregivers in various aspects (physical, emotional, social and financial burden, and relationship with care recipient); it was subsequently revised to a shorter 22-item version. [21,23] Singapore's population is rapidly ageing, with an increasing proportion of elderly residents (12.4% in 2016 and expected to double in number by 2030) and a decreasing support ratio (5.4 residents aged 20-64 years per resident aged \u226565 years in 2016 vs. 13.5 in 1970). [24,25] With such changing demographics, informal home-based caregiving is expected to be increasingly demanding, and this may further exacerbate the issue of caregiver burdens. Thus, it is imperative to understand the prevalence, predictive factors and impact of caregiver burdens in Singapore.\nSingapore is a unique developed city state in Southeast Asia with a multi-ethnic and multicultural population consisting of 74.3% Chinese, 13.4% Malay, 9.1% Indian and 3.2% other ethnicities as of 2016. [24] Current evidence suggests that caregiving experiences and outcomes are affected by culture, with different levels of burden reported among Asian caregivers and their Western counterparts. [26][27][28] In many Asian societies, including Singapore, traditional Confucian principles such as filial piety may have an impact on the caregiving experience. [29,30] The validity of instruments measuring caregiver burden developed in the West has also been questioned when they are applied to a different population and cultural setting. [31] Therefore, it is of great interest to review studies on caregiver burden conducted in a multi-ethnic, multicultural population in Singapore, and to compare these findings with those from international literature. This will enable recognition of the magnitude of problem within the local context and highlight the presence of critical knowledge gaps that may have health policy implications.\nThe primary aim of this review paper is to summarise research papers on caregiver burden in Singapore, in terms of its prevalence, measurement scales, predictive factors, and its impact on both caregiver and care recipient outcomes.\n\nSearch strategies and inclusion criteria\nWe carried out a systematic literature search using PubMed\u00ae and Scopus\u00ae up to 30 January 2018. In our search strategy, we included these key terms: caregiver, burden, stress, strain and Singapore. Specifically, the search terms for  was 90%. Table 1 summarises the key findings of the included articles. [32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41][42][43][44][45][46][47][48][49][50][51] Studies on caregiver burden in Singapore focused mostly on caregivers of the elderly [36,38,42,43,48,50] and persons with dementia. [40,41,46,51] Other studied populations included caregivers of cancer patients, [35,36] psychiatric patients, [37,44] people with chronic illness, [45] discharged hospital patients with long-term care referrals, [34] hip fracture patients [47] and patients on peritoneal dialysis. [39] Of the 20 studies, nine presented data on the prevalence of caregiver burden. The prevalence reported ranged from 23.0% to 59.2% in studies conducted in different study populations. For example, among caregivers of community-dwelling elderly, one study found that 24.5% of caregivers fulfilled the criterion for caregiver burden, [38] while another study found 39.0% with mild-moderate burden and 7.3% with moderate-severe burden among caregivers of elderly with dependence in their activities of daily living. [50] In patients with cancer, two studies found significant burden in 23% and 50% of caregivers of patients with cancer attending an outpatient oncology clinic and patients with advanced cancer, respectively. [35,36] A study based on national household survey data found that 30.9% of relatives of persons with chronic physical or mental illness were perceived to have high burden. [45] In Singapore, the most widely used instrument to measure caregiver burden is ZBI, and it was used in seven out of the 20 studies. [32,33,35,36,39,46,50] Of these seven studies, three were conducted in caregivers of persons with dementia. The ZBI was also used for caregivers of cancer patients, elderly with care needs and patients on peritoneal dialysis. Most studies used the 22-item version of the ZBI.\nMultiple studies reported the association between poorer functional status of care recipients [36,48] or higher care demands [35,38,51] and increased caregiver burden. In patients with cognitive impairment, there was increased caregiver burden in those with behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) or behavioural issues. [38,41,46,51] The presence of dementia and dementia severity were also identified as risk factors for caregiver burden. [38,46] Sociodemographic variables of caregivers showed mixed results in terms of their effects on caregiver burden. One study showed that being middle-aged was associated with worse outcomes compared to being younger than 35 years. [37] Another study reported that caregivers who were younger than 75 years performed better compared to older caregivers. [42] However, less burden was seen in older caregivers in another study. [40] In some studies, caregiver age was not found to be a significant predictor of caregiver burden. [38,46,48,51] Four studies did not find a significant association between caregiver burden and the gender of the caregiver. [21,38,46,48] Married caregivers and caregivers without children were correlated Abstract]))) AND English[Language]) AND Singapore. The inclusion criteria were full text original studies published in English on the topic of caregiver burden in Singapore. Meta-analyses, case series, case reports, commentaries and reviews were excluded. Studies that were not in English, not conducted on human subjects, or entirely qualitative were also excluded.\n\nSelection of studies and data collection\nAfter duplicate articles were removed using EndNote\u2122 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA), two independent researchers (i.e. first and second authors, YXL and SY) screened the titles and abstracts of the retrieved studies and engaged in discussion whenever discrepancies arose. The full text studies were then independently read and assessed for eligibility by the two researchers. In the case of disagreement during the evaluation process, any discord was resolved by discussion with a third researcher (i.e. lead author, LLL). Once an article was deemed to be eligible, data from the eligible article was extracted independently by YXL and SY using a standardised information extraction format that included the authors, year of study, populations studied (including population size and characteristics), instrument for caregiver measures, prevalence, predictive factors and impact of caregiver burden. Risk of bias assessment (e.g. selection, attrition and detection bias) was performed by LLL by means of one of the SIGN checklists that is appropriate for the study design (https:\/\/www.sign.ac.uk\/ checklists-and-notes.html).\n\nRESULTS\nIn total, 206 articles were retrieved from PubMed\u00ae and Scopus\u00ae. After removing 92 duplicates and 94 articles that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria, the final number of articles included for full text review was 20 [ Figure 2]. The percentage agreement between the first and second authors  1. Spousal and adult children caregivers showed worse self-rated general health and stress compared to non-immediate family caregivers, but difference did not reach statistical significance 2. Family caregivers who utilised home-based services presented poorer self-rated general health than those who did not use any services\n\nImpact: Nil\nNo data on caregiver well-being before patient use of LTC services Chua et al., [35]  \u2022 Potential variables such as dementia stage, presence of BPSD, use of community services were not considered.\nKhoo et al., [41]  Tan et al., [49]   with increased burden in one study, [38] but this finding was not replicated in another study. [46] Some studies found an effect of ethnicity: Malay caregivers showed less burden and negative impact, [42,45] while Chinese caregivers had greater impairment on self-esteem compared to their Malay and Indian counterparts. [37] Not all studies, however, reported ethnicity as a significant factor. [38,46] Socioeconomic factors also played a role. Caregivers who were unemployed or had lower income, [37] stayed in one-or two-room public housing, [42] or experienced financial strain [47] had worse outcomes. However, employment was not found to be a significant predictive factor in some studies. [46,51] Having the support of a foreign domestic worker was found to moderate the impact of caregiving for elderly requiring assistance in at least one activity of daily living and was associated with better caregiving outcomes. [43] This mitigating effect of external help was, however, not seen in all studies. [38,46] The coping strategies used by caregivers of persons with dementia also played a role; for instance, the use of behavioural disengagement or criticism as a coping strategy was linked to increased burden. [46] Four of the included studies measured the associated outcomes of caregiver burden. Increased caregiver burden was associated with reduced quality of life and increased depressive symptoms. [35,40,42] It also disrupted caregivers' work and schedules. [35,37] Two of these studies found that caregivers were more likely to have poorer self-rated health and more outpatient visits. [37,42]\n\nPopulation studied and prevalence of caregiver burden\nStudies on caregiver burden in Singapore have largely concentrated on those caring for the elderly or demented. Caregivers of patients with other medical conditions or demographic characteristics (e.g. paediatric patients with genetic disorders) are under-represented and would, therefore, be prime candidates for further research endeavours. This will likely give a more complete picture of caregiver burden in Singapore.\nThe prevalence of caregiver burden in the included studies was reported to be 23.0%-59.2%. This is similar to the prevalence reported by other studies outside Singapore that used similar measurement scales. [52][53][54][55] With Singapore's ageing population and more elderly developing multiple and complex health conditions, the prevalence would be expected to increase even further. [25] Health policymakers may be better informed to allocate appropriate resources to develop integrated and targeted health intervention programmes in the community to address this pressing issue.\n\nMeasures of caregiver burden\nZBI is the most widely used among the included studies and has been validated in Singapore. [56] The use of the ZBI as a measure has certain advantages. Firstly, it has been extensively studied and validated in a wide variety of settings, with well-documented psychometric properties. Secondly, its wide use allows healthcare providers to standardise reporting of caregiver burden and easily compare results obtained across different studies. However, its use as a unidimensional measure to produce a summary score may overlook the uniqueness and rich data from the individual dimensions. [31] One observation is that studies in Singapore have uniformly adopted the use of quantitative measures to evaluate caregiver burden. The advantages of quantitative measures are their value for statistical analysis, as well as the ease of adaptation for use in clinical settings due to their directness and practicality. However, it has been argued that caregivers may conceptualise burden in ways that differ from descriptions used in measures, leading to a potential failure of the instruments to capture the entire breadth of burden. [31] Future mixed method approaches may enhance the comprehensiveness of research on this topic.\n\nPredictive factors\nThe predictive ability of sociodemographic factors has been mixed in this review, which is consistent with other international studies which found that caregiver outcomes may not directly correlate with caregiver sociodemographic factors. [23,[57][58][59] For example, female caregivers were shown to be at higher risk in some studies, [60,61] but not in others. [62,63] Some studies showed Malay caregivers experienced less burden and negative impact, [42,45] whereas other studies reported ethnicity as not a significant factor. [38,46] The real-life difficulty in predicting caregiver burden based on sociodemographic factors was also reflected in one study done on a broad population, which used national household survey data with a large sample size and good response rate but only found a limited number of predictors. [45] Furthermore, these predictors only explained 10% of the variance observed, which the authors attributed to a lack of information on other significant factors related to burden. This suggests that there are likely to be hidden predictors and confounders that are beyond the usual variables captured, which warrants more explorative qualitative studies. Further studies may also explore the complex interplay of the role of culture, social values and sociodemographic factors.\nCoping strategies appeared to influence the perceived burden in Singapore caregivers. [46] This is consistent with other studies which reported that strategies focused on problem-solving may be more effective in reducing caregiver burden than strategies that are focused on emotions. [64,65] This is of potential value, as caregiver coping strategy is a modifiable variable that can be pre-empted and targeted in tailored health intervention programmes for them. A future research direction may be an interventional trial to assess the effectiveness of coping strategy programmes to reduce caregiver burden.\nPertaining to care recipient factors, caregiver burden increased with caregiving demands, physical dependency and duration of time spent on care. [35,36,38,48] Similar findings about the impact of physical dependency have also been shown in other studies. [66] In addition, behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms, as well as the presence and severity of dementia were found to increase caregiver burden. [38,41,46,51] This is also consistent with findings in the existing literature that behavioural disturbances are often the most prominent predictive factor of burden. [67,68]\n\nImpact of caregiver burden\nThe included studies evaluated the negative impact of caregiver burden on caregivers. This is important, as caregivers can be forgotten in the doctor-patient relationship. [69][70][71] Engaging the caregivers and addressing their needs are crucial, as caregivers play an essential role in keeping patients well in the community. [64,68,72] Further research efforts may also focus on how other caregiving constructs, such as caregiver grief, can have a negative impact on adverse caregiver outcomes. [73,74] On the other hand, it is also imperative to evaluate the effect of caregiver burden on care recipients (patients); however, none of the included studies had done so. Given the measured prevalence of caregiver burden in Singapore, it would be of great concern if caregiver burden translates into worse clinical outcomes for patients and increased healthcare costs. Future research efforts may focus on whether caregiver burden is associated with worse patient outcomes such as mortality, quality of life and healthcare expenditure.\n\nStrengths and limitations\nThis article is an attempt to review the existing medical literature on caregiver burden in Singapore -a developed, multiracial and multicultural city-state. Our findings highlight important challenges in studying this highly subjective issue with cultural sensitivity. This article further builds on the current literature on caregiver burden by providing unique experiences in a multicultural setting in Singapore, which can inform future studies that intend to examine caregiver burden in other settings with non-homogeneous cultural backgrounds. One limitation of this review is that the focus of studies done in Singapore may limit its generalisability. Secondly, the risk of bias was assessed by one author. The search strategy may be further optimised by including more comprehensive search terms (such as 'carer') and other databases such as PsychInfo and CINAHL. Furthermore, this review did not have a registered protocol prior to the commencement of the study, which is another of its limitation. Finally, the broad topic of this review may limit its applicability to specific patient populations.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThere is a significant prevalence of caregiver burden in Singapore. The ZBI is the most commonly used tool to measure caregiver burden in Singapore. In particular, caregivers of people with functional, cognitive and behavioural impairments appear to be at increased risk of burden. In our local context, caregiver burden is associated with various adverse caregiver outcomes, such as reduced quality of life and increased depressive symptoms. Given the limited number of studies in Singapore, future research efforts may include: studies that focus on under-represented populations beyond the elderly with dementia; mixed method studies to uncover more predictive factors for caregiver burden, especially cultural and sociodemographic factors in the Malay population; and studies that examine the impact of caregiver burden on care recipients.\n\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\n\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts of interest.","label":0}

She's a roboticist, professor Georgia Tech, and director of the Human Automation Systems Lab with research interests in human robot interaction, assistive robots in the home, therapy gaming apps, and remote robotic exploration of extreme environments. Like me, in her work, she cares a lot about both robots and human beings. And so I really enjoyed this conversation. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on Apple Podcast, follow on Spotify, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter, at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N. I recently started doing ads at the end of the introduction. I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. I hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store. I personally use Cash App to send money to friends, but you can also use it to buy, sell, and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds. Cash App also has a new investing feature. You can buy fractions of a stock, say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is. Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing, a subsidiary of Square and Member SIPC. I'm excited to be working with Cash App to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST, best known for their FIRST Robotics and Lego competitions. They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students in over 110 countries and have a perfect rating and charity navigator, which means that donated money is used to maximum effectiveness. When you get Cash App from the App Store or Google Play and use code LexPodcast, you'll get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST, which again is an organization that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys to dream of engineering a better world. And now here's my conversation with Ayanna Howard. What or who is the most amazing robot you've ever met, or perhaps had the biggest impact on your career? I haven't met her, but I grew up with her, but of course Rosie. So, and I think it's because also- Who's Rosie? Rosie from the Jetsons. She is all things to all people, right? Think about it, like anything you wanted, it was like magic, it happened. So people not only anthropomorphize, but project whatever they wish for the robot to be onto Rosie. But also, I mean, think about it. She was socially engaging. She every so often had an attitude, right? She kept us honest. She would push back sometimes when George was doing some weird stuff. But she cared about people, especially the kids. She was like the perfect robot. And you've said that people don't want their robots to be perfect. Can you elaborate that? What do you think that is? Just like you said, Rosie pushed back a little bit every once in a while. Yeah, so I think it's that, so if you think about robotics in general, we want them because they enhance our quality of life. And usually that's linked to something that's functional. Even if you think of self-driving cars, why is there a fascination? Because people really do hate to drive. Like there's the, like Saturday driving where I can just speed, but then there's the, I have to go to work every day and I'm in traffic for an hour. I mean, people really hate that. And so robots are designed to basically enhance our ability to increase our quality of life. And so the perfection comes from this aspect of interaction. If I think about how we drive, if we drove perfectly, we would never get anywhere, right? So think about how many times you had to run past the light because you see the car behind you is about to crash into you or that little kid kind of runs into the street and so you have to cross on the other side because there's no cars, right? Like if you think about it, we are not perfect drivers. Some of it is because it's our world. And so if you have a robot that is perfect in that sense of the word, they wouldn't really be able to function with us. Can you linger a little bit on the word perfection? So from the robotics perspective, what does that word mean and how is sort of the optimal behavior as you're describing different than what we think is perfection? Yeah, so perfection, if you think about it in the more theoretical point of view, it's really tied to accuracy, right? So if I have a function, can I complete it at 100% accuracy with zero errors? And so that's kind of, if you think about perfection in the sense of the word. And in a self-driving car realm, do you think from a robotics perspective, we kind of think that perfection means following the rules perfectly, sort of defining, staying in the lane, changing lanes. When there's a green light, you go. When there's a red light, you stop. And that's the, and be able to perfectly see all the entities in the scene. That's the limit of what we think of as perfection. And I think that's where the problem comes, is that when people think about perfection for robotics, the ones that are the most successful are the ones that are, quote unquote, perfect. Like I said, Rosie is perfect. But she actually wasn't perfect in terms of accuracy, but she was perfect in terms of how she interacted and how she adapted. And I think that's some of the disconnect, is that we really want perfection with respect to its ability to adapt to us. We don't really want perfection with respect to 100% accuracy, with respect to the rules that we just made up anyway, right? And so I think there's this disconnect sometimes between what we really want and what happens. And we see this all the time, like in my research, right? Like the optimal, quote unquote, optimal interactions are when the robot is adapting based on the person, not 100% following what's optimal based on the rules. Just to link on autonomous vehicles for a second, just your thoughts maybe off the top of your head, is how hard is that problem, do you think, based on what we just talked about? There's a lot of folks in the automotive industry, they're very confident from Elon Musk to Waymo to all these companies. How hard is it to solve that last piece? The last mile. The gap between the perfection and the human definition of how you actually function in this world? Yeah, so this is a moving target. So I remember when all the big companies started to heavily invest in this, and there was a number of, even roboticists, as well as folks who were putting in the VCs and corporations, Elon Musk being one of them, that said, self-driving cars on the road with people within five years. That was a little while ago. And now people are saying, five years, 10 years, 20 years, some are saying never, right? I think if you look at some of the things that are being successful is these, basically fixed environments where you still have some anomalies, right? You still have people walking, you still have stores, but you don't have other drivers, right? Like other human drivers is a dedicated space for the cars. Because if you think about robotics in general, where it's always been successful, I mean, you can say manufacturing, like way back in the day, right? It was a fixed environment. Humans were not part of the equation. We're a lot better than that. But when we can carve out scenarios that are closer to that space, then I think that it's where we are. So a closed campus where you don't have self-driving cars and maybe some protection so that the students don't jet in front just because they wanna see what happens. Like having a little bit, I think that's where we're gonna see the most success in the near future. And be slow moving. Right, not 55, 60, 70 miles an hour, but the speed of a golf cart, right? So that said, the most successful in the automotive industry robots operating today in the hands of real people are ones that are traveling over 55 miles an hour and in unconstrained environments, which is Tesla vehicles, so Tesla autopilot. So I would love to hear sort of your, just thoughts of two things. So one, I don't know if you've gotten to see, you've heard about something called Smart Summon where Tesla system, autopilot system, where the car drives zero occupancy, no driver in the parking lot slowly sort of tries to navigate the parking lot to find itself to you. And there's some incredible amounts of videos and just hilarity that happens as it awkwardly tries to navigate this environment. But it's a beautiful nonverbal communication between machine and human that I think is a, it's like, it's some of the work that you do in this kind of interesting human robot interaction space. So what are your thoughts in general about it? So I do have that feature. Do you drive a Tesla? I do. Mainly because I'm a gadget freak, right? So I say it's a gadget that happens to have some wheels. And yeah, I've seen some of the videos. But what's your experience like? I mean, you're a human robot interaction roboticist. You're a legit sort of expert in the field. So what does it feel for a machine to come to you? It's one of these very fascinating things, but also I am hyper, hyper alert, right? Like I'm hyper alert. Like my butt, my thumb is like, oh, okay. I'm ready to take over. Even when I'm in my car or I'm doing things like automated backing into, so there's like a feature where you can do this automating backing into our parking space or bring the car out of your garage or even pseudo autopilot on the freeway, right? I am hypersensitive. I can feel like as I'm navigating, like, yeah, that's an error right there. Like I am very aware of it, but I'm also fascinated by it. And it does get better. Like I look and see it's learning from all of these people who are cutting it on. Like every time I cut it on, it's getting better, right? And so I think that's what's amazing about it is that. This nice dance of you're still hyper vigilant. So you're still not trusting it at all. Yeah. And yet you're using it. On the highway, if I were to like, what, as a roboticist, we'll talk about trust a little bit. How do you explain that? You still use it. Is it the gadget freak part? Like where you just enjoy exploring technology or is that the right actually balance between robotics and humans is where you use it, but don't trust it. And somehow there's this dance that ultimately is a positive. Yeah. So I think I'm, I just don't necessarily trust technology, but I'm an early adopter, right? So when it first comes out, I will use everything, but I will be very, very cautious of how I use it. Do you read about it or do you explore it, but just try it. They do like crudely to put it crudely. Do you read the manual or do you learn through exploration? I'm an explorer. If I have to read the manual, then I do design. Then it's a bad user interface. It's a failure. Elon Musk is very confident that you kind of take it from where it is now to full autonomy. So from this human robot interaction where you don't really trust and then you try and then you catch it when it fails to, it's going to incrementally improve itself into full, to full where you don't need to participate. What's your sense of that trajectory? Is it feasible? So the promise there is by the end of next year, by the end of 2020 is the current promise. What's your sense about that journey that Tess is on? So there's kind of three things going on though. I think in terms of will people go like as a user, as a adopter, will you trust going to that point? I think so, right? Like there are some users and it's because what happens is when you're hypersensitive at the beginning and then the technology tends to work, your apprehension slowly goes away. And as people, we tend to swing to the other extreme, right? Because like, oh, I was like hyper, hyper fearful or hypersensitive and it was awesome. And we just tend to swing, that's just human nature. And so you will have, I mean, and I- That's a scary notion because most people are now extremely untrusting of autopilot. They use it, but they don't trust it. And it's a scary notion that they're not going to trust it. And it's a scary notion that there's a certain point where you allow yourself to look at the smartphone for like 20 seconds. And then there'll be this phase shift where it'll be like 20 seconds, 30 seconds, one minute, two minutes. It's a scary proposition. But that's people, right? That's humans. I mean, I think of even our use of, I mean, just everything on the internet, right? Like think about how reliant we are on certain apps and engines, right? 20 years ago, people have been like, oh yeah, that's stupid. Like that makes no sense. Like, of course that's false. Like now it's just like, oh, of course I've been using it. It's been correct all this time. Of course, aliens, I didn't think they existed, but now it says they do, obviously. 100%, earth is flat. So, okay, but you said three things. So one is the human kind of solution. Okay, so one is the human. And I think there will be a group of individuals that will swing, right? Teenagers. Teenagers, I mean, it'll be adults. There's actually an age demographic that's optimal for technology adoption. And you can actually find them. And they're actually pretty easy to find. Just based on their habits, based on... So if someone like me who wasn't a roboticist would probably be the optimal kind of person, right? Early adopter, okay with technology, very comfortable and not hypersensitive, right? I'm just hypersensitive because I designed this stuff. So there is a target demographic that will swing. The other one though is you still have these humans that are on the road. That one is a harder thing to do. And as long as we have people that are on the same streets, that's gonna be the big issue. And it's just because you can't possibly... You can't possibly map some of the silliness of human drivers, right? Like as an example, when you're next to that car that has that big sticker called student driver, right? Like you are like, oh, either I am going to like go around. Like we know that that person is just gonna make mistakes that make no sense, right? How do you map that information? Or if I am in a car and I look over and I see two fairly young looking individuals and there's no student driver bumper and I see them chit chatting to each other, I'm like, oh, that's an issue, right? So how do you get that kind of information and that experience into basically an autopilot? Yeah, and there's millions of cases like that where we take little hints to establish context. I mean, you said kind of beautifully poetic human things, but there's probably subtle things about the environment, about it being maybe time for commuters to start going home from work and therefore you can make some kind of judgment about the group behavior of pedestrians, blah, blah, blah, and so on. Or even cities, right? Like if you're in Boston, how people cross the street, like lights are not an issue versus other places where people will actually wait for the crosswalk. Seattle or somewhere peaceful. And but what I've also seen sort of just even in Boston that intersection to intersection is different. So every intersection has a personality of its own. So certain neighborhoods of Boston are different. So we're kind of, and based on different timing of day, at night, it's all, there's a dynamic to human behavior that we kind of figure out ourselves. We're not able to introspect and figure it out, but somehow our brain learns it. We do. And so you're saying, is there a shortcut? Is there a shortcut though for a robot? Is there something that could be done, you think, that that's what we humans do. It's just like bird flight, right? That's the example they give for flight. Do you necessarily need to build a bird that flies or can you do an airplane? Is there a shortcut to it? So I think the shortcut is, and I kind of, I talk about it as a fixed space where, so imagine that there's a neighborhood that's a new smart city or a new neighborhood that says, you know what, we are going to design this new city based on supporting self-driving cars. And then doing things, knowing that there's anomalies, knowing that people are like this, right? And designing it based on that assumption that we're gonna have this, that would be an example of a shortcut. So you still have people, but you do very specific things to try to minimize the noise a little bit as an example. And the people themselves become accepting of the notion that there's autonomous cars, right? Right, they move into, so right now you have, you will have a self-selection bias, right? Individuals will move into this neighborhood knowing this is part of the real estate pitch, right? And so I think that's a way to do a shortcut. One, it allows you to deploy, it allows you to collect then data with these variances and anomalies because people are still people, but it's a safer space and it's more of an accepting space. I.e. when something in that space might happen because things do, because you already have the self-selection, like people would be, I think, a little more forgiving than other places. And you said three things, do we cover all of them? The third is legal law, liability, which I don't really wanna touch, but it's still of concern. And the mishmash with policy as well, sort of government, all that whole mess. That big ball of stuff. Yeah, gotcha. So that's, so we're out of time now. Do you think from a robotics perspective, if you're kind of honest of what cars do, they kind of threaten each other's life all the time. So cars are very, I mean, in order to navigate intersections, there's an assertiveness, there's a risk taking. And if you were to reduce it to an objective function, there's a probability of murder in that function, meaning you killing another human being, and you're using that. First of all, it has to be low enough to be acceptable to you on an ethical level as an individual human being, but it has to be high enough for people to respect you to not sort of take advantage of you completely and jaywalk and funny and so on. So, I mean, I don't think there's a right answer here, but how do we solve that? How do we solve that from a robotics perspective when danger and human life is at stake? Yeah, as they say, cars don't kill people, people kill people. People kill people. Right. So I think- And now robotic algorithms would be killing people. Right, so it will be robotics algorithms that are, no, it will be robotic algorithms don't kill people, developers of robotic algorithms kill people, right? I mean, one of the things is people are still in the loop, and at least in the near and midterm, I think people will still be in the loop at some point, even if it's a developer. Like we're not necessarily at the stage where, you know, robots are programming autonomous robots with different behaviors quite yet. It's a scary notion, sorry to interrupt, that a developer has some responsibility in the death of a human being. That's a heavy burden. I mean, I think that's why the whole aspect of ethics in our community is so, so important, right? Like, because it's true. If you think about it, you can basically say, I'm not going to work on weaponized AI, right? Like people can say, that's not what I'm gonna do. But yet you are programming algorithms that might be used in healthcare algorithms that might decide whether this person should get this medication or not, and they don't, and they die. Okay, so that is your responsibility, right? And if you're not conscious and aware that you do have that power when you're coding and things like that, I think that's just not a good thing. Like we need to think about this responsibility as we program robots and computing devices much more than we are. Yeah, so it's not an option to not think about ethics. I think it's a majority, I would say, of computer science. Sort of, it's kind of a hot topic now to think about bias and so on. But it's, and we'll talk about it, but usually it's kind of, it's like a very particular group of people that work on that. And then people who do like robotics are like, well, I don't have to think about that. There's other smart people thinking about it. It seems that everybody has to think about it. It's not, you can't escape the ethics, whether it's bias or just every aspect of ethics that has to do with human beings. Everyone, so think about, I'm gonna age myself, but I remember when we didn't have like testers, right? And so what did you do? As a developer, you had to test your own code, right? Like you had to go through all the cases and figure it out. And then they realized that, we probably need to have testing because we're not getting all the things. And so from there, what happens is like most developers, they do a little bit of testing, but it's usually like, okay, did my compiler bug out? Let me look at the warnings. Okay, is that acceptable or not? Right, like that's how you typically think about as a developer and you'll just assume that it's going to go to another process and they're gonna test it out. But I think we need to go back to those early days when you're a developer, you're developing. There should be like this, okay, let me look at the ethical outcomes of this because there isn't a second like testing ethical testers. Right, it's you. We did it back in the early coding days. I think that's where we are with respect to ethics. Like let's go back to what was good practices and only because we were just developing the field. Yeah, and it's a really heavy burden. I've had to feel it recently in the last few months, but I think it's a good one to feel. Like I've gotten a message more than one from people. I've unfortunately gotten some attention recently. And I've gotten messages that say that I have blood in my hands because of working on semi-autonomous vehicles. So the idea that you have semi-autonomy means people would lose vigilance and so on. That's actually be humans as we describe. And because of that, because of this idea that we're creating automation, there'll be people be hurt because of it. And I think that's a beautiful thing. I mean, it's many nights where I wasn't able to sleep because of this notion. You really do think about people that might die because of this technology. Of course, you can then start rationalizing and saying, well, you know what? 40,000 people die in the United States every year and we're trying to ultimately try to save lives. But the reality is your code you've written might kill somebody. And that's an important burden to carry with you as you design the code. I don't even think of it as a burden. If we train this concept correctly from the beginning. And I use, and not to say that coding is like being a medical doctor, but think about it, medical doctors, they've been in situations where their patient didn't survive, right? Do they give up and go away? No, every time they come in, they know that there might be a possibility that this patient might not survive. And so when they approach every decision, like that's in their back of their head. And so why isn't that we aren't teaching and those are tools though, right? They are given some of the tools to address that so that they don't go crazy. But we don't give those tools so that it does feel like a burden versus something of, I have a great gift and I can do great, awesome good. But with it comes great responsibility. I mean, that's what we teach in terms of, you think about the medical schools, right? Great gift, great responsibility. I think if we just change the messaging a little, great gift, being a developer, great responsibility. And this is how you combine those. But do you think, I mean, this is really interesting. It's outside, I actually have no friends who are sort of surgeons or doctors. I mean, what does it feel like to make a mistake in a surgery and somebody to die because of that? Like, is that something you could be taught in medical school sort of how to be accepting of that risk? So, because I do a lot of work with healthcare robotics, I have not lost a patient, for example. The first one's always the hardest, right? But they really teach the value, right? So they teach responsibility, but they also teach the value. Like, you're saving 40,000, but in order to really feel good about that, when you come to a decision, you have to be able to say at the end, I did all that I could possibly do, right? Versus a, well, I just picked the first widget, right? So every decision is actually thought through. It's not a habit, it's not a, let me just take the best algorithm that my friend gave me. It's a, is this it? This, this, the best? Have I done my best to do good, right? And so- And I think burden is the wrong word. It's a gift, but you have to treat it extremely seriously. Correct. So on a slightly related note, in a recent paper, The Ugly Truth About Ourselves and Our Robot Creations, you discuss, you highlight some biases that may affect the function of various robotic systems. Can you talk through, if you remember, examples of some? There's a lot of examples. I usually- What is bias, first of all? Yeah, so bias is this, and so bias, which is different than prejudice. So bias is that we all have these preconceived notions about particular, everything from particular groups, to habits, to identity, right? So we have these predispositions. And so when we address a problem, we look at a problem, make a decision, those preconceived notions might affect our outputs, our outcomes. So there, the bias could be positive and negative. And then is prejudice the negative kind of bias? Prejudice is the negative, right? So prejudice is that not only are you aware of your bias, but you are then take it and have a negative outcome, even though you're aware. And there could be gray areas too. There's always gray areas. That's the challenging aspect of all ethical questions. So I always like, so there's a funny one. And in fact, I think it might be in the paper, because I think I talk about self-driving cars. But think about this. We, for teenagers, right? Typically, insurance companies charge quite a bit of money if you have a teenage driver. So you could say that's an age bias, right? But no one will, I mean, parents will be grumpy, but no one really says that that's not fair. That's interesting. We don't, that's right. That's right. It's everybody in human factors and safety research, almost, I mean, is quite ruthlessly critical of teenagers. And we don't question, is that okay? Is that okay to be ageist in this kind of way? And it is ageist, right? It's definitely ageist. There's no question about it. And so this is the gray area, right? Because you know that teenagers are more likely to be in accidents, and so there's actually some data to it. But then if you take that same example and you say, well, I'm going to make the insurance higher for an area of Boston, because there's a lot of accidents. And then they find out that that's correlated with socioeconomics. Well, then it becomes a problem, right? Like that is not acceptable, but yet the teenager, which is age, it's against age, is, right? So- And the way we figure that out as a society by having conversations, by having discourse, let me throw out history, the definition of what is ethical or not has changed, and hopefully always for the better. Correct, correct. So in terms of bias or prejudice in robotic, in algorithms, what examples do you sometimes think about? So I think about quite a bit the medical domain, just because historically, right? The healthcare domain has had these biases, typically based on gender and ethnicity, primarily. A little on age, but not so much. Historically, if you think about FDA and drug trials, it's harder to find women that aren't childbearing, and so you may not test on drugs at the same level. Right, so there's these things. And so if you think about robotics, right? Something as simple as I'd like to design an exoskeleton. What should the material be? What should the weight be? What should the form factor be? Who are you gonna design it around? I will say that in the US, women, average height and weight is slightly different than guys. So who are you gonna choose? Like if you're not thinking about it from the beginning as, okay, when I design this and I look at the algorithms and I design the control system and the forces and the torques, if you're not thinking about, well, you have different types of body structure, you're gonna design to what you're used to. Oh, this fits all the folks in my lab, right? So think about it from the very beginning is important. What about sort of algorithms that train on data kind of thing? Sadly, our society already has a lot of negative bias. And so if we collect a lot of data, even if it's a balanced way, it's going to contain the same bias that our society contains. And so, yeah, is there things there that bother you? Yeah, so you actually said something. You had said how we have biases, but hopefully we learn from them and we become better. And so that's where we are now. So the data that we're collecting is historic. So it's based on these things. When we knew it was bad to discriminate, but that's the data we have and we're trying to fix it now, but we're fixing it based on the data that was used in the first place to discriminate. Fix it in post. Right. And so the decisions, and you can look at everything from the whole aspect of predictive policing, criminal recidivism. There was a recent paper that had the healthcare algorithms, which had kind of a sensational titles. I'm not pro sensationalism in titles, but again, you read it, right? So it makes you read it, but I'm like, really? Like, ugh, you could have. What's the topic of the sensationalism? I mean, what's underneath it? What's, if you could sort of educate me on what kind of bias creeps into the healthcare space. Yeah, so. I mean, you already kind of mentioned. So this one was, the headline was racist AI algorithms. Okay, like, okay, that's totally a clickbait title. And so you looked at it and so there was data that these researchers had collected. I believe, I wanna say it was either science or nature. It just was just published, but they didn't have a sensational title. It was like the media. And so they had looked at demographics, I believe between black and white women, right? And they showed that there was a discrepancy in the outcomes, right? And so, and it was tied to ethnicity, tied to race. The piece that the researchers did actually went through the whole analysis, but of course. I mean, the journalists with AI are problematic across the board, I would say. And so this is a problem, right? And so there's this thing about, oh, AI, it has all these problems. We're doing it on historical data and the outcomes aren't even based on gender or ethnicity or age. But I am always saying is like, yes, we need to do better. We need to do better. It is our duty to do better, but the worst AI is still better than us. Like you take the best of us and we're still worse than the worst AI, at least in terms of these things. And that's actually not discussed, right? And so I think, and that's why the sensational title, right? And so it's like, so then you can have individuals go like, oh, we don't need to use this AI. I'm like, oh, no, no, no, no. I want the AI instead of the doctors that provided that data, because it's still better than that, right? I think that's really important to linger on. Is the idea that this AI is racist, it's like, well, compared to what? Sort of the, I think we set, unfortunately, way too high of a bar for AI algorithms. And in the ethical space where perfect is, I would argue probably impossible, then if we set the bar of perfection, essentially, of it has to be perfectly fair, whatever that means, is it means we're setting it up for failure. But that's really important to say what you just said, which is, well, it's still better than it is. And one of the things I think that we don't get enough credit for, just in terms of as developers, is that you can now poke at it, right? So it's harder to say, is this hospital, is this city doing something, right? Until someone brings in a civil case, right? Well, with AI, it can process through all this data and say, hey, yes, there was some, an issue here, but here it is, we've identified it, and then the next step is to fix it. I mean, that's a nice feedback loop, versus waiting for someone to sue someone else before it's fixed, right? And so I think that power, we need to capitalize on a little bit more, right? Instead of having the sensational titles, have the, okay, this is a problem, and this is how we're fixing it, and people are putting money to fix it because we can make it better. I look at like facial recognition, how Joy, she basically called out a couple of companies and said, hey, and most of them were like, oh, embarrassment, and the next time it had been fixed, right? It had been fixed better, right? And then it was like, oh, here's some more issues. And I think that conversation then moves that needle to having much more fair and unbiased and ethical aspects, as long as both sides, the developers are willing to say, okay, I hear you, yes, we are going to improve, and you have other developers who are like, hey, AI, it's wrong, but I love it, right? Yes. So speaking of this really nice notion that AI is maybe flawed but better than humans, so just made me think of it, one example of flawed humans is our political system. Do you think, or you said judicial as well, do you have a hope for AI sort of being elected for president or running our Congress or being able to be a powerful representative of the people? So I mentioned, and I truly believe that this whole world of AI is in partnerships with people. And so what does that mean? I don't believe, or maybe I just don't, I don't believe that we should have an AI for president, but I do believe that a president should use AI as an advisor, right? Like if you think about it, every president has a cabinet of individuals that have different expertise that they should listen to, right, like that's kind of what we do. And you put smart people with smart expertise around certain issues and you listen. I don't see why AI can't function as one of those smart individuals giving input. So maybe there's an AI on healthcare, maybe there's an AI on education and right, like all of these things that a human is processing, right? Because at the end of the day, there's people that are human that are going to be at the end of the decision. And I don't think as a world, as a culture, as a society, that we would totally believe, and this is us, like this is some fallacy about us, but we need to see that leader, that person as human. And most people don't realize that like leaders have a whole lot of advice, right? Like when they say something, it's not that they woke up, well, usually they don't wake up in the morning and be like, I have a brilliant idea, right? It's usually a, okay, let me listen. I have a brilliant idea, but let me get a little bit of feedback on this, like, okay. And then it's a, yeah, that was an awesome idea, or it's like, yeah, let me go back. We already talked through a bunch of them, but are there some possible solutions to the bias that's present in our algorithms beyond what we just talked about? So I think there's two paths. One is to figure out how to systematically do the feedback and correction. So right now it's ad hoc, right? It's a researcher identify some outcomes that are not, don't seem to be fair, right? They publish it, they write about it, and either the developer or the companies that have adopted the algorithms may try to fix it, right? And so it's really ad hoc and it's not systematic. There's, it's just, it's kind of like, I'm a researcher, that seems like an interesting problem, which means that there's a whole lot out there that's not being looked at, right? Because it's kind of researcher driven. And I don't necessarily have a solution, but that process I think could be done a little bit better. One way is I'm going to poke a little bit at some of the corporations, right? Like maybe the corporations, when they think about a product, they should instead of, in addition to hiring these, bug, they give these. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Like awards when you find a bug. Yeah, security bug. Let's put it like, we will give the, whatever the award is that we give for the people who find these security holes, find an ethics hole, right? Like find an unfairness hole, and we will pay you X for each one you find. I mean, why can't they do that? One is a win-win. They show that they're concerned about it, that this is important, and they don't have to necessarily dedicate it their own internal resources. And it also means that everyone who has their own bias lens, like I'm interested in age, and so I'll find the ones based on age, and I'm interested in gender, right? Which means that you get all of these different perspectives. But you think of it in a data-driven way. So like sort of, if we look at a company like Twitter, it gets, it's under a lot of fire for discriminating against certain political beliefs. Correct. And sort of, there's a lot of people, this is the sad thing, because I know how hard the problem is, and I know the Twitter folks are working really hard at it. Even Facebook, that everyone seems to hate, are working really hard at this. You know, the kind of evidence that people bring is basically anecdotal evidence. Well, me or my friend, all we said is X, and for that we got banned. And that's kind of a discussion of saying, well, look, that's usually, first of all, the whole thing is taken out of context. So they present sort of anecdotal evidence. And how are you supposed to, as a company, in a healthy way have a discourse about what is and isn't ethical? How do we make algorithms ethical when people are just blowing everything? Like, they're outraged about a particular anecdotal piece of evidence that's very difficult to sort of contextualize in a big data-driven way. Do you have a hope for companies like Twitter and Facebook? Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things going on, right? First off, remember this whole aspect of we are becoming reliant on technology. We're also becoming reliant on a lot of these, the apps and the resources that are provided, right? So some of it is kind of anger, like, I need you, right? And you're not working for me, right? Not working for me, that's right. But I think, and so some of it, and I wish that there was a little bit of change of rethinking. So some of it is like, oh, we'll fix it in-house. No, that's like, okay, I'm a fox and I'm going to watch these hens because I think it's a problem that foxes eat hens. No, right? Like, be good citizens and say, look, we have a problem. And we are willing to open ourselves up for others to come in and look at it and not try to fix it in-house. Because if you fix it in-house, there's conflict of interest. If I find something, I'm probably gonna wanna fix it and hopefully the media won't pick it up, right? And that then causes distrust because someone inside is gonna be mad at you and go out and talk about how, yeah, they canned the resume survey because, right? Like, be nice people. Like, just say, look, we have this issue. Community, help us fix it and we will give you like the bug finder fee if you do. Did you ever hope that the community, us as a human civilization on the whole is good and can be trusted to guide the future of our civilization into a positive direction? I think so. So I'm an optimist, right? And there were some dark times in history always. I think now we're in one of those dark times. I truly do. In which aspect? The polarization. And it's not just US, right? So if it was just US, I'd be like, yeah, it's a US thing. But we're seeing it like worldwide, this polarization. And so I worry about that. But I do fundamentally believe that at the end of the day, people are good, right? And why do I say that? Because anytime there's a scenario where people are in danger, and I will use, so Atlanta, we had a snowmageddon and people can laugh about that. People at the time, so the city closed for, you know, little snow, but it was ice and the city closed down. But you had people opening up their homes and saying, hey, you have nowhere to go, come to my house, right? Hotels were just saying, like, sleep on the floor. Like places like, you know, the grocery stores were like, hey, here's food. There was no like, oh, how much are you gonna pay me? It was like this, such a community. And like people who didn't know each other, strangers, were just like, can I give you a ride home? And that was a point I was like, you know what? Like... That reveals that the deeper thing is, there's a compassion or love that we all have within us. It's just that when all of that is taken care of and get bored, we love drama. Yes. And that's, I think almost like the division is a sign of the times being good, is that it's just entertaining on some unpleasant mammalian level to watch, to disagree with others. And Twitter and Facebook are actually, taking advantage of that in a sense, because it brings you back to the platform and they're advertiser driven, so they make a lot of money. So you go back and you're slick. Love doesn't sell quite as well in terms of advertisement. It doesn't. So you've started your career at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, but before I ask a few questions there, have you happened to have ever seen Space Odyssey, 2001 Space Odyssey? Yes. Okay. Do you think HAL 9000, so we're talking about ethics, do you think HAL did the right thing by taking the priority of the mission over the lives of the astronauts? Do you think HAL is good or evil? Easy questions. Yeah. HAL was misguided. You're one of the people that would be in charge of an algorithm like HAL. So how would you do better? If you think about what happened was there was no fail safe, right? So we, perfection, right? Like, what is that? I'm gonna make something that I think is perfect, but if my assumptions are wrong, it'll be perfect based on the wrong assumptions, right? That's something that you don't know until you deploy and then you're like, oh yeah. Yeah, messed up. But what that means is that when we design software, such as in Space Odyssey, when we put things out, that there has to be a fail safe. There has to be the ability that once it's out there, we can grade it as an F and it fails and it doesn't continue, right? There's some way that it can be brought in and removed and that's aspect, because that's what happened with HAL. It was like, assumptions were wrong. It was perfectly correct based on those assumptions and there was no way to change it, change the assumptions at all. And the change, the fallback would be to a human. So you ultimately think like human should be, you know, it's not turtles or AI all the way down. It's at some point there's a human that actually makes it. I still think that, and again, because I do human robot interaction, I still think the human needs to be part of the equation at some point. So what, just looking back, what are some fascinating things in robotics space that NASA was working at the time? Or just in general, what have you gotten to play with and what are your memories from working at NASA? Yeah, so one of my first memories was they were working on a surgical robot system that could do eye surgery. Right? And this was back in, oh my gosh, it must've been, oh, maybe 92, 93, 94. So it's almost like a remote operation. Yeah, it was remote operation. And in fact, you can even find some old tech reports on it. So think of it, you know, like now we have DaVinci, right? Like think of it, but these were like the late 90s. Right? And I remember going into the lab one day and I was like, what's that? Right? And of course it wasn't pretty, right? Cause the technology, but it was like functional. And you had this individual that could use version of haptics to actually do the surgery. And they had this mock-up of a human face and like the eyeballs and you can see this little drill. And I was like, oh, that is so cool. That one I vividly remember because it was so outside of my like possible thoughts of what could be done. Just the kind of precision and I mean, what's the most amazing of a thing like that? I think it was the precision. It was the kind of first time that I had physically seen this robot machine human interface, right? Versus, cause manufacturing had been, you saw those kinds of big robots, right? But this was like, oh, this is in a person. There's a person and a robot like in the same space. The meeting them in person. Like for me, it was a magical moment that I can't, as life transforming that I recently met Spot Mini from Boston Dynamics. Oh, see. I don't know why, but on the human robot interaction, for some reason I realized how easy it is to anthropomorphize. And it was, I don't know. It was almost like falling in love, this feeling of meeting. And I've obviously seen these robots a lot and video and so on, but meeting in person, just having that one-on-one time. It's different. It's different. So have you had a robot like that in your life that was made you maybe fall in love with robotics? Sort of like meeting in person. I mean, I loved robotics. From the beginning. Yeah, so I was a 12 year old, like I'm gonna be a roboticist. I actually was, I called it cybernetics. But so my motivation was Bionic Woman. I don't know if you know that. And so, I mean, that was like a seminal moment, but I didn't meet, like that was TV, right? Like it wasn't like I was in the same space and I met, I was like, oh my gosh, you're like real. Just linking on Bionic Woman, which by the way, because I read that about you, I watched a bit bits of it and it's just so, no offense, terrible. It's cheesy. It's cheesy. Look at it now. It's cheesy. I've seen a couple of reruns lately. But it's, but of course at the time it was probably but the sound effects. Captured the imagination. Especially when you're younger, it just catch you. But which aspect, did you think of it, you mentioned cybernetics, did you think of it as robotics or did you think of it as almost constructing artificial beings? Like, is it the intelligent part that captured your fascination or was it the whole thing? Like even just the limbs and just the. So for me, it would have, in another world, I probably would have been more of a biomedical engineer because what fascinated me was the bionic, was the parts, like the bionic parts, the limbs, those aspects of it. Are you especially drawn to humanoid or human-like robots? I would say human-like, not humanoid, right? And when I say human-like, I think it's this aspect of that interaction whether it's social and it's like a dog, right? Like that's human-like because it understands us, it interacts with us at that very social level. Humanoids are part of that, but only if they interact with us as if we are human. But just to linger on NASA for a little bit, what do you think, maybe if you have other memories, but also what do you think is the future of robots in space? We mentioned HAL, but there's incredible robots that NASA's working on in general, thinking about as we venture out, human civilization ventures out into space. What do you think the future of robots is there? Yeah, so I mean, there's the near term. For example, they just announced the rover that's going to the moon, which, you know, that's kind of exciting, but that's like near term. You know, my favorite, favorite, favorite series is Star Trek, right? You know, I really hope, and even Star Trek, like if I calculate the years, I wouldn't be alive, but I would really, really love to be in that world. Like even if it's just at the beginning, like, you know, like voyage, like adventure one. So basically living in space. Yeah. With what robots, what are robots? With data. What role? Data would have to be, even though that wasn't, you know, that was like later, but. So data is a robot that has human-like qualities. Right, without the emotion chip, yeah. You don't like emotion in your robots? Well, so data with the emotion chip was kind of a mess, right? It took a while for that, for them to adapt. But, and so why was that an issue? The issue is that emotions make us irrational agents. That's the problem. And yet he could think through things, even if it was based on an emotional scenario, right? Based on pros and cons. But as soon as you made him emotional, one of the metrics he used for evaluation was his own emotions, not people around him, right? Like, and so. We do that as children, right? So we're very egocentric when we're young. We are very egocentric. And so isn't that just an early version of the emotion chip then? I haven't watched much Star Trek. Except I have also met adults. We've met, yeah. Right, and so that is a developmental process. And I'm sure there's a bunch of psychologists that could go through. Like you can have a 60 year old adult who has the emotional maturity of a 10 year old, right? And so there's various phases that people should go through in order to evolve. And sometimes you don't. So how much psychology do you think, a topic that's rarely mentioned in robotics, but how much does psychology come to play when you're talking about HRI, human robot interaction? When you have to have robots that actually interact with you. Tons. So we, like my group, as well as I, read a lot in the cognitive science literature, as well as the psychology literature. Because they understand a lot about human-human relations and developmental milestones and things like that. And so we tend to look to see what's been done out there. Sometimes what we'll do is we'll try to match that to see is that human-human relationship the same as human robot? Sometimes it is, and sometimes it's different. And then when it's different, we have to, we try to figure out, okay, why is it different in this scenario, but it's the same in the other scenario. Right? And so we try to do that quite a bit. Would you say that's, if we're looking at the future of human-robot interaction, would you say the psychology piece is the same as human-robot interaction? Would you say the psychology piece is the hardest? Like if, I mean, it's a funny notion for you as, I don't know if you consider, yeah. I mean, one way to ask it, do you consider yourself a roboticist or a psychologist? Oh, I consider myself a roboticist that plays the act of a psychologist. But if you were to look at yourself, sort of, you know, 20, 30 years from now, do you see yourself more and more wearing the psychology hat? And sort of, another way to put it is, are the hard problems in human-robot interactions fundamentally psychology, or is it still robotics, the perception, manipulation, planning, all that kind of stuff? It's actually neither. The hardest part is the adaptation and the interaction. So- The learning. It's the interface, it's the learning. And so if I think of, like, I've become much more of a roboticist slash AI person, then when I, like originally, again, I was about the bionics. I was an electrical engineer, I was control theory, right? And then I started realizing that my algorithms needed like human data, right? And so then I was like, okay, what is this human thing? How do I incorporate human data? And then I realized that human perception had, there was a lot in terms of how we perceive the world. And so trying to figure out how do I model human perception from my, and so I became a HRI person, human-robot interaction person, from being a control theory and realizing that humans actually offered quite a bit. And then when you do that, you become more of an artificial intelligence AI. And so I see myself evolving more in this AI world under the lens of robotics having hardware interacting with people. So you're a world-class expert researcher in robotics, and yet others, there's a few, it's a small, but fierce community of people, but most of them don't take the journey into the age of HRI, into the human. So why did you brave into the interaction with humans? It seems like a really hard problem. It's a hard problem and it's very risky as an academic. Yes. And I knew that when I started down that journey, that it was very risky as an academic in this world that was nuanced, it was just developing. We didn't even have a conference, right, at the time. Because it was the interesting problems. That was what drove me. It was the fact that I looked at what interests me in terms of the application space and the problems, and that pushed me into trying to figure out what people were and what humans were and how to adapt to them. If those problems weren't so interesting, I'd probably still be sending rovers to glaciers, right? But the problems were interesting. And the other thing was that they were hard, right? So I like having to go into a room and being like, I don't know what to do. And then going back and saying, okay, I'm gonna figure this out. I'm not driven when I go and I'm like, oh, there are no surprises. Like, I don't find that satisfying. If that was the case, I'd go someplace and make a lot more money, right? I think I stay an academic because, and choose to do this because I can go into a room and I'm like, that's hard. Yeah, I think just from my perspective, maybe you can correct me on it, but if I just look at the field of AI broadly, it seems that human-robot interaction has the most, one of the most number of open problems. People, especially relative to how many people are willing to acknowledge that there are. Because most people are just afraid of the humans, so they don't even acknowledge how many open problems there are, but in terms of difficult problems to solve, exciting spaces, it seems to be incredible for that. It is, and it's exciting. You mentioned trust before. What role does trust from interacting with autopilot to in the medical context, what role does trust play in the human-robot interactions? So some of the things I study in this domain is not just trust, but it really is over-trust. How do you think about over-trust? Like, what is, first of all, what is trust and what is over-trust? Basically, the way I look at it is trust is not what you click on a survey. Trust is about your behavior. So if you interact with the technology based on the decision or the actions of the technology, as if you trust that decision, then you're trusting. And even in my group, we've done surveys that, on the thing, do you trust robots? Of course not. Would you follow this robot in a burning building? Of course not. And then you look at their actions and you're like, clearly your behavior does not match what you think, or what you think you would like to think. And so I'm really concerned about the behavior because that's really, at the end of the day, when you're in the world, that's what will impact others around you. It's not whether before you went onto the street, you clicked on, like, I don't trust self-driving cars. You know, that, from an outsider perspective, it's always frustrating to me. Well, I read a lot. So I'm an insider in a certain philosophical sense. It's frustrating to me how often trust is used in surveys and how people, say, make claims out of any kind of finding they make while somebody clicking on answer. Because trust is, yeah, behavior, just, you said it beautifully. I mean, the action, your own behavior is what trust is. I mean, that everything else is not even close. It's almost like absurd, comedic poetry that you weave around your actual behavior. So some people can say they trust, you know, I trust my wife, husband, or not, whatever, but the actions is what speaks volumes. You bug their car. Yeah. You probably don't trust them. I trust them, but I'm just making sure. No, no, that's, yeah. Like, even if you think about cars, I think it's a beautiful case. I came here at some point, I'm sure, on either Uber or Lyft, right? I remember when it first came out, right? I bet if they had had a survey, would you get in the car with a stranger and pay them? Yes. How many people do you think would have said, like, really? You know, wait, even worse. Would you get in the car with a stranger at 1 a.m. in the morning to have them drop you home as a single female? Yeah. Like, how many people would say, that's stupid? Yeah. And now look at where we are. I mean, people put kids, right? Like, oh yeah, my child has to go to school, and yeah, I'm gonna put my kid in this car with a stranger. I mean, it's just fascinating how, like, what we think we think is not necessarily matching our behavior. Yeah, and certainly with robots, with autonomous vehicles, and all the kinds of robots you work with, that's, yeah, it's, the way you answer it, especially if you've never interacted with that robot before, if you haven't had the experience, you being able to respond correctly on a survey is impossible. But what role does trust play in the interaction, do you think? Like, is it good to trust a robot? What does over-trust mean? Is it good to, kind of how you feel about autopilot currently, which is like, from a roboticist perspective, is like, oh, you're still very cautious? Yeah, so this is still an open area of research, but basically what I would like in a perfect world is that people trust the technology when it's working 100%, and people will be hypersensitive and identify when it's not. But of course we're not there. That's the ideal world. And, but we find is that people swing, right? They tend to swing, which means that if my first, and like, we have some papers, like first impressions is everything, right? If my first instance with technology, with robotics, is positive, it mitigates any risk, it correlates with like best outcomes, it means that I'm more likely to either not see it when it makes some mistakes or faults, or I'm more likely to forgive it. And so this is a problem because technology is not 100% accurate, right? It's not 100% accurate, although it may be perfect. How do you get that first moment right, do you think? There's also an education about the capabilities and limitations of the system. Do you have a sense of how do you educate people correctly in that first interaction? Again, this is an open-ended problem. So one of the study that actually has given me some hope that I was trying to figure out how to put in robotics. So there was a research study that has showed for medical AI systems, giving information to radiologists about, you know, here you need to look at these areas on the X-ray. What they found was that when the system provided one choice, there was this aspect of either no trust or over-trust, right, like I'm not going, I don't believe it at all, or a yes, yes, yes, yes, and they would miss things, right? Instead, when the system gave them multiple choices, like here are the three, even if it knew like, you know, it had estimated that the top area you need to look at was some place on the X-ray, if it gave like one plus others, the trust was maintained and the accuracy of the entire population increased, right? So basically it was a, you're still trusting the system, but you're also putting in a little bit of like your human expertise, like your human decision processing into the equation. So it helps to mitigate that over-trust risk. Yeah, so there's a fascinating balance to have to strike. Haven't figured out again, if robotics is still an open research. Exciting open area research, exactly. So what are some exciting applications of human-robot interaction? You started a company, maybe you can talk about the exciting efforts there, but in general also what other space can robots interact with humans and help? Yeah, so besides healthcare, cause you know, that's my bias lens. My other bias lens is education. I think that, well, one, we definitely, in the US, you know, we're doing okay with teachers, but there's a lot of school districts that don't have enough teachers. If you think about the teacher-student ratio for at least public education in some districts, it's crazy. It's like, how can you have learning in that classroom, right, because you just don't have the human capital. And so if you think about robotics, bringing that in to classrooms, as well as the after-school space, where they offset some of this lack of resources in certain communities, I think that's a good place. And then turning on the other end is using these systems then for workforce retraining and dealing with some of the things that are going to come out later on of job loss, like thinking about robots and AI systems for retraining and workforce development. I think that's exciting areas that can be pushed even more, and it would have a huge, huge impact. What would you say are some of the open problems in education, sort of, it's exciting. So young kids and the older folks, or just folks of all ages who need to be retrained, who need to sort of open themselves up to a whole other area of work. What are the problems to be solved there? How do you think robots can help? We have the engagement aspect, right? So we can figure out the engagement. That's not a... What do you mean by engagement? So identifying whether a person is focused is... Like that we can figure out. What we can figure out, and there's some positive results in this, is that personalized adaptation based on any concepts. So imagine I think about, I have an agent and I'm working with a kid learning, I don't know, Algebra 2. Can that same agent then switch and teach some type of new coding skill to a displaced mechanic? Like, what does that actually look like, right? Like, hardware might be the same, content is different, two different target demographics of engagement. Like, how do you do that? How important do you think personalization is in human-robot interaction? And not just mechanic or student, but like literally to the individual human being? I think personalization is really important, but a caveat is that I think we'd be okay if we can personalize to the group, right? And so if I can label you as along some certain dimensions, then even though it may not be you specifically, I can put you in this group. So the sample size, this is how they best learn, this is how they best engage. Even at that level, it's really important. And it's because, I mean, it's one of the reasons why educating in large classrooms is so hard, right? You teach to the median, but there's these individuals that are struggling, and then you have highly intelligent individuals, and those are the ones that are usually kind of left out. So highly intelligent individuals may be disruptive, and those who are struggling might be disruptive because they're both bored. Yeah, and if you narrow the definition of the group or in the size of the group enough, you'll be able to address their individual. It's not individual needs, but really most of- Group needs or- Group, most important group needs. Right. Right, and that's kind of what a lot of successful recommender systems do with Spotify and so on. It's sad to believe, but I'm, as a music listener, probably in some sort of large group. Yeah. It's very sadly predictable. You have been labeled. Yeah, I've been labeled, and successfully so, because they're able to recommend stuff that I like. Yeah, but applying that to education, right? There's no reason why it can't be done. Do you have a hope for our education system? I have more hope for workforce development. Yep. And that's because I'm seeing investments. Even if you look at VC investments in education, the majority of it has lately been going to workforce retraining, right? And so I think that government investments is increasing. There's like a claim, and some of it's based on fear, right? Like AI is gonna come and take over all these jobs. What are we gonna do with all these non-paying taxes that aren't coming to us by our citizens? And so I think I'm more hopeful for that. Not so hopeful for early education, because it's this, it's still a who's gonna pay for it, and you won't see the results for like 16 to 18 years. It's hard for people to wrap their heads around that. But on the retraining part, what are your thoughts? There's a candidate, Andrew Yang, running for president, and saying that sort of AI automation robots are gonna take our jobs. Universal basic income. Universal basic income in order to support us as we kind of automation takes people's jobs and allows you to explore and find other means. Like do you have a concern of society transforming effects of automation and robots and so on? I do. I do know that AI robotics will displace workers. Like we do know that. But there'll be other workers that will be defined new jobs. What I worry about is, that's not what I worry about. Like will all the jobs go away? What I worry about is the type of jobs that will come out. Like people who graduate from drill jobs like people who graduate from Georgia Tech will be okay. We give them the skills, they will adapt even if their current job goes away. I do worry about those that don't have that quality of an education. Will they have the ability, the background to adapt to those new jobs? That I don't know. That I worry about, which will create even more polarization in our society, internationally and everywhere. I worry about that. I also worry about not having equal access to all these wonderful things that AI can do and robotics can do. I worry about that. People like me from Georgia Tech, from say MIT, will be okay. But that's such a small part of the population that we need to think much more globally of having access to the beautiful things, whether it's AI in healthcare, AI in education, AI in politics, right? I worry about that. And that's part of the thing that you were talking about is people that build the technology have to be thinking about ethics, have to be thinking about access and all those things. And not just a small subset. Let me ask some philosophical, slightly romantic questions. All right. People that listen to this will be like, here he goes again. Okay, do you think one day we'll build an AI system that a person can fall in love with and it would love them back? Like in the movie Her, for example. Yeah, although she kinda didn't fall in love with him. She fell in love with like a million other people, something like that. You're the jealous type, I see. We humans are the jealous type. So I do believe that we can design systems where people would fall in love with their robot, with their AI partner. That I do believe. Because it's actually, and I don't like to use the word manipulate, but as we see, there are certain individuals that can be manipulated if you understand the cognitive science about it, right? Right, so I mean, if you could think of all close relationship and love in general as a kind of mutual manipulation, that dance, the human dance, I mean, manipulation is a negative connotation. And that's why I don't like to use that word particularly. I guess another way to phrase it is, you're getting at it as it could be algorithmatized or something, it could be a- The relationship building part can be. I mean, just think about it. We have, and I don't use dating sites, but from what I heard, there are some individuals that have been dating that have never saw each other, right? In fact, there's a show, I think, that tries to weed out, fake people, like there's a show that comes out, right? Because people start faking. What's the difference of that person on the other end being an AI agent, right? And having a communication, are you building a relationship remotely? There's no reason why that can't happen. In terms of human-robot interaction, well, so what role, you've kind of mentioned with data, emotion, being, can be problematic if not implemented well, I suppose, what role does emotion and some other human-like things, the imperfect things come into play here for good human-robot interaction and something like love? Yeah, so in this case, and you had asked, can an AI agent love a human back? I think they can emulate love back, right? And so what does that actually mean? It just means that if you think about their programming, they might put the other person's needs in front of theirs in certain situations, right? Think about it as return on investment. Like, was my return on investment as part of that equation, that person's happiness has some type of algorithm waiting to it. And the reason why is because I care about them, right? That's the only reason, right? But if I care about them and I show that, then my final objective function is length of time of the engagement, right? So you can think of how to do this actually quite easily. And so- But that's not love? Well, so that's the thing. I think it emulates love because we don't have a classical definition of love. Right, and we don't have the ability to look into each other's minds to see the algorithm. And I guess what I'm getting at is, is it possible that, especially if that's learned, especially if there's some mystery and black box nature to the system, how is that, you know- How is it any different? How is it any different? And in terms of sort of if the system says, I'm conscious, I'm afraid of death, and it does indicate that it loves you. Another way to sort of phrase it, be curious to see what you think. Do you think there'll be a time when robots should have rights? You've kind of phrased the robot in a very roboticist way and just a really good way, but saying, okay, well, there's an objective function and I could see how you can create a compelling human-robot interaction experience that makes you believe that the robot cares for your needs and even something like loves you. But what if the robot says, please don't turn me off? What if the robot starts making you feel like there's an entity of being a soul there, right? Do you think there'll be a future, hopefully you won't laugh too much at this, but where they do ask for rights? So I can see a future if we don't address it in the near term, where these agents, as they adapt and learn, could say, hey, this should be something that's fundamental. I hopefully think that we would address it before it gets to that point. You think that's a bad future? Is that a negative thing where they ask or being discriminated against? I guess it depends on what role have they attained at that point, right? And so if I think about now- Careful what you say because the robot's 50 years from now will be listening to this and you'll be on TV saying, this is what roboticists used to believe. Well, right? And so this is my, and as I said, I have a biased lens and my robot friends will understand that. So if you think about it, and I actually put this in kind of the, as a roboticist, you don't necessarily think of robots as human with human rights, but you could think of them either in the category of property or you can think of them in the category of animals, right? And so both of those have different types of rights. So animals have their own rights as a living being, but they can't vote, they can't write, they can be euthanized, but as humans, if we abuse them, we go to jail, right? So they do have some rights that protect them, but don't give them the rights of like citizenship. And then if you think about property, property, the rights are associated with the person, right? So if someone vandalizes your property or steals your property, like there are some rights, but it's associated with the person who owns that. If you think about it, back in the day, and if you remember, we talked about, how society has changed, women were property, right? They were not thought of as having rights. They were thought of as property of, like they're- Yeah, assaulting a woman meant assaulting the property of somebody else's property. Exactly, and so what I envision is, is that we will establish some type of norm at some point, but that it might evolve, right? Like if you look at women's rights now, like there are still some countries that don't have, and the rest of the world is like, why that makes no sense, right? And so I do see a world where we do establish some type of grounding. It might be based on property rights, it might be based on animal rights. And if it evolves that way, I think we will have this conversation at that time, because that's the way our society traditionally has evolved. So, beautifully put, just out of curiosity, Enki, Jibo, Mayfield Robotics, with their robot, Curi, Syfy Works, Rethink Robotics, were all these amazing robotics companies led, created by incredible roboticists, and they've all went out of business recently. Why do you think they didn't last longer? Why is it so hard to run a robotics company, especially one like these, which are fundamentally HRI, Human-Robot Interaction Robots? Yeah, each one has a story. Only one of them I don't understand, and that was Enki. That's actually the only one I don't understand. I don't understand it either. I mean, I look from the outside, I've looked at their sheets, I've looked at the data that's been... Oh, you mean business-wise, you don't understand it, gotcha. Yeah, and I look at that data, and I'm like, they seem to have product-market fit. Yeah. So that's the only one I don't understand. The rest of it was product-market fit. What's product-market fit, just out of... How do you think about it? Yeah, so although Rethink Robotics was getting there, but I think it's just the timing, their clock just timed out. I think if they'd been given a couple more years, they would have been okay. But the other ones were still fairly early by the time they got into the market. And so product-market fit is, I have a product that I wanna sell at a certain price. Are there enough people out there, the market, that are willing to buy the product at that market price for me to be a functional, viable, profit-bearing company? So product-market fit. If it costs you $1,000 and everyone wants it and only is willing to pay a dollar, you have no product-market fit, even if you could sell it for, you know, it's enough for a dollar, because you can't... So how hard is it for robots, sort of maybe if you look at iRobot, the company that makes Roombas vacuum cleaners, can you comment on, did they find the right product, market-product fit? Like, are people willing to pay for robots is also another kind of question. So do you think about iRobot and their story, right? Like when they first, they had enough of a runway, right? When they first started, they weren't doing vacuum cleaners, right? They were contracts primarily, government contracts, designing robots. Or military robots. Yeah, I mean, that's what they were. That's how they started, right? And then... They still do a lot of incredible work there, but yeah, that was the initial thing that gave them enough funding to... To then try to, the vacuum cleaner is what I've been told, was not like their first rendezvous in terms of designing a product, right? And so they were able to survive until they got to the point that they found a product price market, right? And even with, if you look at the Roomba, the price point now is different than when it was first released, right? It was an early adopter price, but they found enough people who were willing to fund it and I mean, I forgot what their loss profile was for the first couple of years, but they became profitable in sufficient time that they didn't have to close their doors. So they found the right, there's still people willing to pay a large amount of money, so over a thousand dollars for a vacuum cleaner. Unfortunately for them, now that they've proved everything out, figured it all out, now there's competitors. Yeah, and so that's the next thing, right? The competition and they have quite a number even internationally, like there's some products out there, you can go to Europe and be like, oh, I didn't even know this one existed. So this is the thing though, like with any market, this is not a bad time, although as a roboticist, it's kind of depressing, but I actually think about things like with, I would say that all of the companies that are now in the top five or six, they weren't the first to the stage, right? Like Google was not the first search engine, sorry, Alta Vista, right? Facebook was not the first, sorry, MySpace, right? Like think about it, they were not the first players. Those first players, like they're not in the top five, 10 of Fortune 500 companies, right? They started to prove out the market, they started to get people interested, they started the buzz, but they didn't make it to that next level, but the second batch, right? The second batch, I think, might make it to the next level. When do you think the Facebook of, oh. The Facebook of robotics. Sorry, I take that phrase back because people deeply, for some reason, well, I know why, but it's, I think, exaggerated distrust Facebook because of the privacy concerns and so on, and with robotics, one of the things you have to make sure is all the things we talked about is to be transparent and have people deeply trust you to let a robot into their lives, into their home. What do you think the second batch of robots will, is it five, 10 years, 20 years that we'll have robots in our homes and robots in our hearts? So if I think about, and because I try to follow the VC kind of space in terms of robotic investments, and right now, and I don't know if they're gonna be successful, I don't know if this is the second batch, but there's only one batch that's focused on the first batch, right? And then there's all these self-driving Xs, right? And so I don't know if they're a first batch of something or if, I don't know quite where they fit in, but there's a number of companies, the co-robot, I call them co-robots, that are still getting VC investments. Some of them have some of the flavor of Rethink Robotics, some of them have some of the flavor of Curie. What's a co-robot? So basically a robot and human working in the same space. So some of the companies are focused on manufacturing. So having a robot and human working together in a factory. Some of these co-robots are robots and humans working in the home, working in clinics. There's different versions of these companies in terms of their products, but they're all, so Rethink Robotics would be one of the first, at least well-known companies focused on this space. So I don't know if this is a second batch, or if this is still part of the first batch. That I don't know. And then you have all these other companies in this self-driving space. And I don't know if that's a first batch or again, a second batch. Yeah, so there's a lot of mystery about this now. Of course, it's hard to say that this is the second batch until it proves out, right? Correct. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, we need a unicorn. Yeah, exactly. Why do you think people are so afraid, at least in popular culture, of legged robots like those worked in Boston Dynamics, or just robotics in general, if you were to psychoanalyze that fear, what do you make of it? And should they be afraid, sorry? So should people be afraid? I don't think people should be afraid. But with a caveat, I don't think people should be afraid given that most of us in this world understand that we need to change something, right? So given that. Now, if things don't change, be very afraid. What, which is the dimension of change that's needed? So changing, thinking about the ramifications, thinking about like the ethics, thinking about like the conversation is going on, right? It's not, it's no longer a, we're gonna deploy it and forget that, this is a car that can kill pedestrians that are walking across the street, right? We're not in that stage. We're putting these roads out. There are people out there. A car could be a weapon. Like people are now, solutions aren't there yet, but people are thinking about this as we need to be ethically responsible as we send these systems out, robotics, medical, self-driving. And military too. And military. Which is not as often talked about, but it's really where probably these robots will have a significant impact as well. Correct, correct. Right, making sure that they can think rationally, even having the conversations, who should pull the trigger, right? But overall, you're saying if we start to think more and more as a community about these ethical issues, people should not be afraid. Yeah, I don't think people should be afraid. I think that the return on investment, the impact, positive impact, will outweigh any of the potentially negative impacts. Do you have worries of existential threats of robots or AI that some people kind of talk about and romanticize about and then in the next decade, next few decades? No, I don't. Singularity would be an example. So my concept is that, so remember, robots, AI, is designed by people. It has our values. And I always correlate this with a parent and a child. So think about it. As a parent, what do we want? We want our kids to have a better life than us. We want them to expand. We want them to experience the world. And then as we grow older, our kids think and know they're smarter and better and more intelligent and have better opportunities. And they may even stop listening to us. Yeah. They don't go out and then kill us, right? Like think about it. It's because we, it's instilled in them values. We instilled in them this whole aspect of community. And yes, even though you're maybe smarter and have more money and dah, dah, dah, it's still about this love, caring relationship. And so that's what I believe. So even if like, you know, we've created the singularity in some archaic system back in like 1980 that suddenly evolves, the fact is it might say, I am smarter. I am sentient. These humans are really stupid, but I think it'll be like, yeah, but I just can't destroy them. Yeah. Percent of mental value is still just for it to come back for Thanksgiving dinner every once in a while. Exactly. That's so beautifully put. You've also said that The Matrix may be one of your more favorite AI related movies. Can you elaborate why? Yeah, it is one of my favorite movies. And it's because it represents kind of all the things I think about. So there's a symbiotic relationship between robots and humans, right? That symbiotic relationship is that they don't destroy us. They enslave us, right? But think about it. Even though they enslaved us, they needed us to be happy, right? And in order to be happy, they had to create this crudy world that they then had to live in, right? That's the whole premise. But then there were humans that had a choice, right? You had a choice to stay in this horrific, horrific world where it was your fantasy life with all of the anomalies, perfection, but not accurate. Or you can choose to be on your own and have maybe no food for a couple of days, but you were totally autonomous. And so I think of that as, and that's why. So it's not necessarily us being enslaved, but I think about us having the symbiotic relationship. Robots and AI, even if they become sentient, they're still part of our society and they will suffer just as much as we. Just as us. And there will be some kind of equilibrium that we'll have to find, some symbiotic relationship. Right, and then you have the ethicists, the robotics folks that are like, no, this has got to stop. I will take the other pill in order to make a difference. So if you could hang out for a day with a robot, real or from science fiction, movies, books, safely, and get to pick his or her, their brain, who would you pick? Gotta say it's Data. Data. I was gonna say Rosie, but I'm not really interested in her brain. I'm interested in Data's brain. Data pre or post-emotionship? Pre. But don't you think it'd be a more interesting conversation post-emotionship? Yeah, it would be drama. And I'm human, I deal with drama all the time. But the reason why I wanna pick Data's brain is because I could have a conversation with him and ask, for example, how can we fix this ethics problem? And he could go through the rational thinking, and through that, he could also help me think through it as well. And so there's these fundamental questions I think I could ask him that he would help me also learn from. And that fascinates me. I don't think there's a better place to end it, Aiyana.

{"text":"Nowadays, we have moved many things to the cloud, including your photos, your files and your servers, what about your desktop environment? Imagine you don\u2019t need to carry your heavy laptop any more, and you can access to the computing power of your laptop from any thin clients, such as a tablet with keyboards at anywhere. It\u2019s possible to achieve using AWS instance with ubuntu desktop and Chrome Remote Desktop. I tried other solutions, such as AWS Workspace or VNC connection, but still, find the Chrome Remote Desktop with the lowest latency and close to native desktop performance. Here is how to do so:\n\nLogon to AWS console and launch an instance using the ubuntu server AMI.\n\n2. Once the instance is launched, SSH to your ubuntu server. Update package manager and install wget:\n\n$ sudo apt update\n\n$ sudo apt-get install --assume-yes wget\n\n3. Download Chrome remote desktop package and install:\n\n$ wget https:\/\/dl.google.com\/linux\/direct\/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb\n\n$ sudo dpkg --install chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb\n\n$ sudo apt install --assume-yes --fix-broken\n\n4. Next, we install the desktop GUI environment. I have tested out different distro and found that Xfce performs the best without fancy animations over a slow network.\n\n$ sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install --assume-yes xfce4 desktop-base\n\n5. Configure Chrome Remote Desktop to use Xfce by default:\n\n$ sudo bash -c 'echo \"exec \/etc\/X11\/Xsession \/usr\/bin\/xfce4-session\" > \/etc\/chrome-remote-desktop-session'\n\n6. Install xscreensaver as an alternative to the default Xfce locker, which doesn\u2019t work with remote desktop:\n\n$ sudo apt install --assume-yes xscreensaver\n\n7. Disable display manager as there is no display connected:\n\n$ sudo systemctl disable lightdm.service\n\n8. Add your user account to the Linux group then logout:\n\n$ sudo usermod -a -G chrome-remote-desktop $USER\n\n$ logout\n\n9. On your local laptop browser, open https:\/\/remotedesktop.google.com\/headless Then follow the steps to set up another computer. You would probably copy command to your AWS command, similar to this:\n\nDISPLAY= \/opt\/google\/chrome-remote-desktop\/start-host \\\n\n--code=\"4\/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\" \\\n\n--redirect-url=\"https:\/\/remotedesktop.google.com\/_\/oauthredirect\" \\\n\n--name=\n\n10. Finally, you can remote connect to your ubuntu desktop and have fun!\n\nOne extra tip is that you can display your screensaver, which is not necessary:\n\nYou can now access your desktop environment from anywhere with any device. It\u2019s especially useful as a software engineer who wants to code with a full set of tools as a development environment at any time.\n\nWritten by Victor Leung who is a keen traveller to see every country in the world, passionate about cutting edge technologies.

{"text":" The following is a conversation with Dmitriy Korkin. He's a professor of bioinformatics and computational biology at WPI, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, where he specializes in bioinformatics of complex diseases, computational genomics, systems biology, and biomedical data analytics. I came across Dmitriy's work when in February, his group used the viral genome of the COVID-19 to reconstruct the 3D structure of its major viral proteins and their interaction with the human proteins. In effect, creating a structural genomics map of the coronavirus and making this data open and available to researchers everywhere. We talked about the biology of COVID-19, SARS, and viruses in general, and how computational methods can help us understand their structure and function in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines. This conversation was recorded recently in the time of the coronavirus pandemic. For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I'm sending love your way. Stay strong, we're in this together, we'll beat this thing. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market with as little as one dollar. Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency in the context of the history of money is fascinating. I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history. Debits and credits on ledgers started around 30,000 years ago. The US dollar created over 200 years ago. And Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, released just over 10 years ago. So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but it's still aiming to, and just might, redefine the nature of money.

And now, here's my conversation with Dmitri Korkin. Do you find viruses terrifying or fascinating? When I think about viruses, I think about them, I mean, I imagine them as those villains that do their work so perfectly well. That is impossible not to be fascinated with them. So what do you imagine when you think about a virus? Do you imagine the individual, sort of these 100 nanometer particle things, or do you imagine the whole pandemic, like society level, when you say the efficiency at which they do their work, do you think of viruses as the millions that occupy a human body or a living organism, society level, like spreading as a pandemic, or do you think of the individual little guy? Yes, I think this is a unique concept that allows you to move from microscale to the macroscale. All right, so the virus itself, I mean, it's not a living organism, it's a machine to me, it's a machine, but it is perfected to the way that it essentially has a limited number of functions, it needs to do, necessary functions. And it essentially has enough information just to do those functions, as well as the ability to modify itself. So, it's a machine, it's an intelligent machine. So yeah, look, maybe on that point, you're in danger of reducing the power of this thing by calling it a machine, right? But you now mentioned that it's also possibly intelligent. It seems that there's these elements of brilliance that a virus has, of intelligence, of maximizing so many things, so many things about its behavior and to ensure its survival and its success. So, do you see it as intelligent? So, I think it's a different, I understand it differently than I think about intelligence of a humankind or intelligence of the artificial intelligence, mechanisms. I think the intelligence of a virus is in its simplicity. The ability to do so much with so little material and information. But also, I think it's interesting. It keeps me thinking, it keeps me wondering whether or not it's also an example of the basic swarm intelligence, where essentially the viruses act as the whole and they're extremely efficient in that. So, what do you attribute the incredible simplicity and the efficiency to? Is it the evolutionary process? So, maybe another way to ask that, if you look at the next 100 years, are you more worried about the natural pandemics or the intelligence? Pandemics or the engineered pandemics? So, how hard is it to build a virus? Yes, it's a very, very interesting question because obviously there's a lot of conversations about whether we are capable of engineering an even worse virus. I personally expect and am mostly concerned with the naturally occurring viruses simply because we keep seeing that. We keep seeing new strains of influenza emerging, some of them becoming pandemic. We keep seeing new strains of coronaviruses emerging. This is a natural process and I think this is why it's so powerful. If you ask me, I've read papers about scientists trying to study the capacity of the modern biotechnology to alter the viruses. But I hope that it won't be our main concern in the nearest future. What do you mean by hope? Well, if you look back and look at the history of the most dangerous viruses, right? So, the first thing that comes into mind is smallpox. So, right now there is perhaps a handful of places where the strains of this virus are stored, right? So, this is essentially the effort of the whole society to limit the access to those viruses. You mean in a lab in a controlled environment in order to study. Correct. And then smallpox is one of the viruses for which should be stated. There's a vaccine is developed. Yes, yes. And until 70s, in my opinion, it was perhaps the most dangerous thing that was there. Is that a very different virus than the influenza and the coronaviruses? It is, it is different in several aspects. Biologically, it's a so-called double-stranded DNA virus, but also in the way that it is much more contagious. So, the R naught for, so this is the- What's R naught? R naught is essentially an average number as person infected by the virus can spread to other people. So, then the average number of people that he or she can spread it to. And there is still some discussion about the estimates of the current virus. The estimations vary between 1.5 and three. In case of smallpox, it was five to seven. And we're talking about the exponential growth, right? So, that's a very big difference. It's not the most contagious one. Measles, for example, it's I think 15 and up. But it's definitely more contagious that the seasonal flu than the current coronavirus or SARS for that matter. What makes the virus more contagious? I'm sure there's a lot of variables that come into play, but is it that whole discussion of aerosol and like the size of droplets, if it's airborne, or is there some other stuff that's more biology centered? I mean, there are a lot of components and there are biological components that there are also social components. The ability of the virus to, so the ways in which the virus is spread is definitely one. The ability to virus to stay on the surfaces to survive. The ability of the virus to replicate fast. So, you know- Or once it's in the cell or whatever. Once it's inside the host. And interestingly enough, something that I think we didn't pay that much attention to is the incubation period, the where hosts are symptomatic. And now it turns out that another thing that we, one really needs to take into account the percentage of the symptomatic population because those people still share this virus and they still are contagious. I saw there's an Iceland study, which I think is probably the most impressive size-wise, shows 50%. A symptomatic for this virus. I also recently learned the swine flu is like just the number of people who got infected was in the billions. It was some crazy number. It was like 20% of the population, something crazy like that. So the lucky thing there is the fatality rate is low. But the fact that a virus can just take over an entire population so quickly is terrifying. I think, I mean, this is, you know, that's perhaps my favorite example of a butterfly effect because it's really, I mean, it's even tinier than a butterfly. And look at, you know, and with, you know, if you think about it, right? So it used to be in those bat species. And perhaps because of, you know, a couple of small changes in the viral genome, it first had, you know, become capable of jumping from bats to human. And then it became capable of jumping from human to human. Right, so this is, I mean, it's not even the size of a virus. It's the size of several, you know, several atoms or says, you know, a few atoms. And all of a sudden this change has such a major impact. So is that a mutation like on a single virus? Is that like, so if we talk about those, the flap of a butterfly wing, like what's the first flap? Well, I think this is the mutations that made this virus capable of jumping from bat species to human. Of course, there's, you know, the scientists are still trying to find, I mean, they're still even trying to find who was the first infected, right? The patient zero. The first human. The first human infected, right? I mean, the fact that there are coronaviruses, different strains of coronaviruses in various bat species, I mean, we know that. So we, you know, virologists observed them. They studied them. They look at their genomic sequences. They're trying, of course, to understand what make these viruses to jump from bats to human. There was, you know, similar to that in influenza, there was, I think, a few years ago, there was this, you know, interesting story where several groups of scientists studying influenza virus essentially, you know, made experiments to show that this virus can jump from one species to another, you know, by changing, I think, just a couple of residues. And of course, it was very controversial. I think there was a moratorium on this study for a while, but then the study was released. It was published. So why was there a moratorium? Because it shows through engineering it, through modifying it, you can make it jump. Yes. I personally think it is important to study this. I mean, we should be informed. We should try to understand as much as possible in order to prevent it. But so then the engineering aspect there is, can't you then just start searching because there's so many strands of viruses out there. Can't you just search for the ones in bats that are the deadliest from the virologist perspective and then just try to engineer, try to see how to. But see, there's a nice aspect to it. The really nice thing about engineering viruses, it has the same problem as nuclear weapons, it's hard for it to not lead to mutual self-destruction. So you can't control a virus. It can't be used as a weapon, right? Yeah, that's why in the beginning I said, you know, I'm hopeful because there definitely regulations needed to be introduced. And I mean, as the scientific society is, we are in charge of making the right actions, making the right decisions. But I think we will benefit tremendously by understanding the mechanisms by which the virus can jump, by which the virus can become more dangerous to humans. Because all these answers would eventually lead to designing better vaccines, hopefully universal vaccines, right? And that would be a triumph of science. So what's the universal vaccine? So is that something that, how universal is universal? Well, I mean, you know, so- What's the dream, I guess, because you kind of mentioned the dream of this. I would be extremely happy if we design the vaccine that is able, I mean, I'll give you an example, right? So every year we do a seasonal flu shot. The reason we do it is because, you know, we are in the arms race, you know, our vaccines are in the arms race with constantly changing virus, right? Now, if the next pandemic, influenza pandemic will occur, most likely this vaccine would not save us, right? Although it's the same virus, might be different strain. So if we're able to essentially design a vaccine against influenza A virus, no matter what's the strain, no matter which species did a jump from, that would be, I think that would be a huge, huge progress and advancement. So you mentioned smallpox until the 70s might've been something that you would be worried the most about. What about these days? Well, we're sitting here in the middle of a COVID-19 pandemic, but these days, nevertheless, what is your biggest worry virus-wise? What are you keeping your eye out on? It looks like, and you know, based on the past several years of the new viruses emerging, I think we're still dealing with different types of influence. I mean, so the H7N9 avian flu that emerged, I think a couple of years ago in China, I think the mortality rate was incredible. I mean, it was, you know, I think above 30%, you know. So this is huge. I mean, luckily for us, this strain was not pandemic, so it was jumping from birds to human, but I don't think it was actually transmittable between the humans. And, you know, this is actually a very interesting question which scientists try to understand, right? So the balance, the delicate balance between the virus being very contagious, right? So efficient in spreading and virus to be very pathogenic, you know, causing, you know, harms and deaths to the host. So it looks like that the more pathogenic the virus is, the less contagious it is. Is that a property of biology or what is it? I don't have an answer to that. And I think this is still an open question. But, you know, if you look at, you know, with the coronavirus, for example, if you look at, you know, the deadlier relative MERS, MERS was never a pandemic virus. Right. But the, you know, again, the mortality rate from MERS is far above, you know, I think 20 or 30%. So, you know, it's a very interesting question. So. So whatever is making this all happen doesn't want us dead because it's balancing out nicely. I mean, how do you explain that we're not dead yet? Like, because there's so many viruses and they're so good at what they do. Why do they keep us alive? I mean, we also have, you know, a lot of protection, right? So we do the immune system. And so, I mean, we do have, you know, ways to fight against those viruses. And I think with the, now we're much better equipped, right? So with the discoveries of vaccines and, you know, there are vaccines against the viruses that maybe 200 years ago would wipe us out completely. But because of these vaccines, we are actually, we are capable of eradicating pretty much fully as is the case with smallpox. So if we could, can we go to the basics a little bit of the biology of the virus? How does a virus infect the body? So I think there are some key steps that the virus needs to perform. And of course, the first one, the viral particle needs to get attached to the host cell. In the case of coronavirus, there is a lot of evidence that it actually interacts in the same way as the SARS coronavirus. So it gets attached to AC2 human receptor. And so there is, I mean, as we speak, there is a growing number of papers suggesting it. Moreover, most recent, I think most recent results suggest that this virus attaches more efficiently to this human receptor than SARS. So just to sort of back off, so there is a family of viruses, the coronaviruses and SARS, whatever the heck for that, whatever that stands for. So SARS actually stands for the disease that you get, is the syndrome of acute respiratory. So SARS is the first strand and then there's MERS. MERS and there is, yes, but scientists actually know more than three strands. I mean, so there is the MHV strain, which is considered to be economical model, disease model in mice. And so there is a lot of work done on this virus because it's- But it hasn't jumped to humans yet? No, no. Oh, interesting. Yes. That's fascinating. So, and then you mentioned AC2. So when you say attach, proteins are involved on both sides. Yes. So we have this infamous spike protein on the surface of the virion particle and it does look like a spike. And I mean, that's essentially because of this protein, we call the coronavirus coronavirus. So that what makes corona on top of the surface. So this protein, it actually, it acts, so it doesn't act alone. It actually, it makes a three copies and it makes so-called trimer. So this trimer is essentially a functional unit, a single functional unit that starts interacting with the AC2 receptor. So this is again, another protein that now sits on the surface of a human cell, or a host cell, I would say. And that's essentially in that way, the virus anchors itself to the host cell, because then it needs to actually, it needs to get inside. It fuses its membrane with the host membrane. It releases the key components. It releases its RNA. And then essentially hijacks the machinery of the cell because none of the viruses that we know of have ribosome, the machinery that allows us to print out proteins. So in order to print out proteins that are necessary for functioning of this virus, it actually needs to hijack the host ribosomes. So a virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of proteins, one of which is this functional mechanism of a spike protein that does the attachment. So yeah, so if you look at this virus, there are several basic components, right? So we start with the spike protein. This is not the only surface protein, the protein that lives on the surface of the viral particle. There is also perhaps the protein with the highest number of copies is the membrane protein. So it's essentially, it forms the capsid, sorry, the envelope of the protein of the viral particle. And essentially, you know, helps to maintain a certain curvature, helps to make a certain curvature. Then there is another protein called envelope protein or E protein, and it actually occurs in far less quantities. And still there is ongoing research what exactly does this protein do. So these are sort of the three major surface proteins that make the viral envelope. And when we go inside, then we have another structural protein called nuclear protein. And the purpose of this protein is to protect the viral RNA. So it actually binds to the viral RNA, creates a capsid. And so the rest of the viral information is inside of this, you know, RNA. And, you know, if you compare the amount of the genes or, you know, proteins that are made of these genes, it's much, you know, it's significantly higher than of influenza virus, for example. Influenza virus has, I think, around eight or nine proteins where this one has at least 29. Wow, that has to do with the length of the RNA strand. So, I mean, it affects the length of the RNA strand, right? So because you essentially need to have sort of the minimum amount of information to encode those genes. How many proteins did you say? 29. 29 proteins. Yes, so this is, you know, something definitely interesting because, you know, believe it or not, we've been studying, you know, coronaviruses for over two decades. We've yet to uncover all functionalities of its proteins. Could we maybe take a small tangent and can you say how one would try to figure out what a function of a particular protein is? So you've mentioned people are still trying to figure out what the function of the envelope protein might be or what's the process. So this is where the research that computational scientists do might be of help because, you know, in the past several decades we actually have collected pretty decent amount of knowledge about different proteins in different viruses. So what we can actually try to do, and this is sort of, could be sort of our first lead to a possible function is to see whether those, you know, say we have this genome of the coronavirus, of the novel coronavirus, and we identify the potential proteins. Then in order to infer the function, what we can do, we can actually see whether those proteins are similar to those ones that we already know. Okay, in such a way we can, you know, for example, clearly identify, you know, some critical components that RNA polymerase or different types of proteases, these are the proteins that essentially clip the protein sequences. And so this works in many cases. However, in some cases you have truly novel proteins, and this is a much more difficult task. Now as a small pause, when you say similar, like what if some parts are different and some parts are similar? Like how do you disentangle that? You know, it's a big question. Of course, you know, what bioinformatics does, it does predictions, right? So those predictions, they have to be validated by experiments. Functional or structural predictions? Both, I mean, we do structural predictions, we do functional predictions, we do interactions predictions. Oh, so this is interesting. So you just generate a lot of predictions, like reasonable predictions based on structure and function interaction, like you said. And then here you go. That's the power of bioinformatics, is data grounded, good predictions of what should happen. So in a way I see it, we're helping experimental scientists to streamline their discovery process. Yeah. And the experimental scientists, is that what a virologist is? So yeah, virology is one of the experimental sciences that focus on viruses. They often work with other experimental scientists, for example, the molecular imaging scientists, right? So the viruses often can be viewed and reconstructed through electron microscopy techniques. So, but these are specialists that are not necessarily biologists. They work with small particles, small particles, whether it's viruses or it's an organelle of a human cell, whether it's a complex molecular machinery. So the techniques that are used are very similar in their essence. And so, yeah, so typically, and we see it now, the research on the research on, you know, that is emerging and that is needed often involves the collaborations between virologists, you know, biochemists, people from pharmaceutical sciences, computational sciences. So we have to work together. So from my perspective, just to step back, sometimes I look at this stuff, just how much we understand about RNA and DNA, how much we understand about protein, like your work, the amount of proteins that you're exploring. Is it surprising to you that we were able, we descendants of apes, we're able to figure all of this out? Like how, so you're a computer scientist. So for me, from computer science perspective, I know how to write a Python program, things are clear, but biology is a giant mess, it feels like to me from an outsider's perspective, is how surprising is it, amazing is it, that we were able to figure this stuff out? You know, if you look at the, you know, how computational science and computer science was evolving, right? I think it was just a matter of time that we would approach biology. So we started from applications to much more fundamental systems, physics, and now we are, or, you know, small chemical compounds. All right, so now we are approaching the more complex biological systems. And I think it's a natural evolution of, you know, of the computer science, of mathematics. So sure, that's the computer science side. I just meant even in higher level. So that to me is surprising, that computer science can offer help in this messy world. But I just mean it's incredible that the biologists and the chemists can figure all this out. Or does it just sound ridiculous to you that of course they would? It just seems like a very complicated set of problems. Like the variety of the kinds of things that could be produced in the body. Just like you said, 29 pro, I mean, just getting a hang of it so quickly, it just seems impossible to me. I agree. I mean, it's, and I have to say we are, you know, in the very, very beginning of this journey. I mean, we've yet to, I mean, we've yet to comprehend, not even try to understand and figure out all the details, but we've yet to comprehend the complexity of the cell. We know that neuroscience is not even at the beginning of understanding the human mind. So where's biology sit in terms of understanding the function, deeply understanding the function of viruses and cells? So there, sometimes it's easy to say when you talk about function, what you really refer to is perhaps not a deep understanding, but more of a understanding sufficient to be able to mess with it using a antiviral, like mess with it chemically to prevent some of its function, or do you understand the function? Well, I think we are much farther in terms of understanding of the complex genetic disorder, such as cancer, where you have layers of complexity. And we, you know, as in my laboratory, we're trying to contribute to that research, but we're also, you know, we're overwhelmed with how many different layers of complexity, different layers of mechanisms that can be hijacked by cancer simultaneously. And so, you know, I think biology in the past 20 years, again, from the perspective of the outsider, because I'm not a biologist, but I think it has advanced tremendously. And one thing that where computational scientists and data scientists are now becoming very, very helpful is in the fact, it's coming from the fact that we are now able to generate a lot of information about the cell, whether it's next-generation sequencing or transcriptomics, whether it's live imaging information, where it is, you know, complex interactions between proteins or between proteins and small molecules, such as drugs. We are becoming very efficient in generating this information. And now the next step is to become equally efficient in processing this information and extracting the key knowledge from that. That could then be validated with experiment. Yes. So maybe then going all the way back, you said the first step is seeing if we can match the new proteins you found in the virus against something we've seen before to figure out its function. And then you also mentioned that, but there could be cases where it's a totally new thing, a totally new protein. Is there something bioinformatics can offer when it's a totally new protein? This is where many of the methods, and you probably aware of, you know, the case of machine learning, many of these methods rely on the previous knowledge. Right. So things that where we try to do from scratch are incredibly difficult, you know, something that we call ab initio. And this is, I mean, it's not just the function. I mean, you know, we've yet to have a robust method to predict the structures of these proteins in ab initio, you know, by not using any templates of other related proteins. So protein is a chain of amino acids. Residues. Residues, yeah. And then somehow magically, maybe you can tell me, they seem to fold in incredibly weird and complicated 3D shapes. Yes. So, and that's where actually the idea of protein folding, or just not the idea, but the problem of figuring out how they have the concept, the concept, yeah, how they fold into those weird shapes comes in. So that's another side of computational work. So what, can you describe what protein folding from the computational side is, and maybe your thoughts on the folding at home efforts that a lot of people know that you can use your machine to, Oh yeah. To do protein folding. So yeah, protein folding is, you know, one of those $1 million price challenges, right? So the reason for that is we've yet to understand precisely how the protein gets folded so efficiently to the point that in many cases where you, you know, where you try to unfold it due to the high temperature, it actually folds back into its original state, right? So we know a lot about the mechanisms, right? But putting those mechanisms together and making sense, it's computationally very expensive task. In general, do proteins fold, can they fold in arbitrary large number of ways or do they usually fold in a very small number of ways? It's typically, I mean, we tend to think that, you know, there is a one sort of canonical fold for a protein, although there are many cases where the proteins, you know, upon destabilization, it can be folded into a different conformation. And this is especially true when you look at sort of proteins that include more than one structural units. So those structural units, we call them protein domains. Essentially protein domain is a single unit that typically is evolutionary preserved, that typically carries out a single function and typically has a very distinct fold, right? The structure, 3D structure organization. But turns out that if you look at human, an average protein in a human cell would have two or a bit of two or three such subunits. And how they are trying to fold into the sort of, you know, next level fold, right? So within subunit there's folding and then... And then they fold into the larger 3D structure, right? And all of that, there's some understanding of the basic mechanisms, but not to put together to be able to fold it. We're still, I mean, we're still struggling. I mean, we're getting pretty good about folding relatively small proteins up to 100 residues. I mean, but we're still far away from folding larger proteins. And some of them are notoriously difficult. For example, transmembrane proteins, proteins that sit in the membranes of the cell. They're incredibly important, but they are incredibly difficult to solve. And so basically there's a lot of degrees of freedom, how it folds. And so it's a combinatorial problem where it just explodes. There's so many dimensions. Well, it is a combinatorial problem, but it doesn't mean that we cannot approach it from the non-convenient, not from the brute force approach. And so the machine learning approaches have been emerged that try to tackle it. So folding at home, I don't know how familiar you are with it, but is that using machine learning or is it more brute force? No, so folding at home, it was originally, and I remember I was, I mean, it was a long time ago. I was a post-doc and we learned about this game, because it was originally designed as the game. And I took a look at it and it's interesting because it's very transparent, very intuitive. And from what I heard, I've yet to introduce it to my son, but kids are actually getting very good at folding the proteins. And it came to me not as a surprise, but actually as the sort of manifest of our capacity to solve this kind of problems. When a paper was published in one of these top journals, with the co-authors being the actual players of this game. Wow. So, and what happened was that they managed to get better structures than the scientists themselves. So that was very, I mean, it was kind of profound revelation that problems that are so challenging for a computational science, maybe not that challenging for a human brain. Well, that's a really good, that's a hopeful message always when there's the proof of existence, that there's a proof of existence, that there's a proof of existence, the proof of existence, the existence proof that it's possible. That's really interesting. But it seems, what are the best ways to do protein folding now? So if you look at what DeepMind does with AlphaFold. AlphaFold, yes. So they kind of, that's a learning approach. What's your sense? I mean, your background is in machine learning, but is this a learnable problem? Is this still a brute force? Are we in the Gary Kasparov, the blue days, or are we in the AlphaGo playing the game of Go days of folding? Well, I think we are advancing towards this direction. I mean, if you look, so there is sort of Olympic game for protein folders called CASP. And it's essentially, it's a competition where different teams are given exactly the same protein sequences and they try to predict their structures. And of course there are different sort of sub tasks, but in the recent competition, AlphaFold was among the top performing teams, if not the top performing team. So there is definitely a benefit from the data that have been generated in the past several decades, the structural data. And certainly, we are now at the capacity to summarize this data, to generalize this data and to use those principles in order to predict protein structures. That's one of the really cool things here is, there's, maybe you can comment on it. There seems to be these open data sets of protein. How did that, what that? The protein data bank. The protein data bank. I mean, that's crazy. Is this a recent thing for just the coronavirus or has this been? It's been for many, many years. I believe the first protein data bank was designed on flashcards. So yes, this, I mean, this is a great example of the community efforts of everyone contributing. Because every time you solve a protein or a protein complex, this is where you submit it. And the scientists get access to it. Scientists get to test it. And we, bioinformaticians, use this information to make predictions. So there's no culture of hoarding discoveries here. So this, I mean, you've released a few or a bunch of proteins that were matching, whatever, we'll talk about details a little bit. But it's kind of amazing that that's, it's kind of amazing how open the culture here is. It is. And I think this pandemic actually demonstrated the ability of scientific community to, you know, to solve this challenge collaboratively. And this is, I think, if anything, it actually moved us to a brand new level of collaborations of the efficiency in which people establish new collaborations, in which people offer their help to each other. Scientists offer their help to each other. And publish results too, it's very interesting. We're now trying to figure out, there's a few journals that are trying to sort of do the very, accelerated review cycle, but so many pre-prints. So just posting a paper going out, I think it's fundamentally changing the way we think about papers. Yes. I mean, the way we think about knowledge, I would say. Knowledge. Yes, because, yes, I completely agree. I think now it's, the knowledge is becoming sort of the core value, not the paper or the journal where this knowledge is published. And I think this is, again, we are living in the times where it becomes really crystallized, the idea that the most important value is in the knowledge. So maybe you can comment, like, what do you think is the most important value in the knowledge? So maybe you can comment, like, what do you think the future of that knowledge sharing looks like? So you have this paper that we'll, I hope we'll get a chance to talk about a little bit, but it has like a really nice abstract and introduction and related, like, it has all the usual, I mean, probably took a long time to put together. So, but is that going to remain, like you could have communicated a lot of fundamental ideas about that's less traditionally acceptable by the journal context. So, well, you know, so the first version that we posted, not even on the bio archive, because bio archive back then, it was essentially, you know, overwhelmed with the number of submissions. So our submission, I think it took five or six days just for it to be screened and put online. So we, you know, essentially we put the first preprint on our website and, you know, it started getting accessed right away. So, and, you know, so this original preprint was in a much rougher shape than this paper. And, but we tried, I mean, we honestly tried to be as compact as possible with, you know, introducing the information that is necessary to explain our, you know, our results. So maybe we can dive right in if it's okay. Sure. So it's a paper called Structural Genomics of SARS-CoV-2. How do you even pronounce SARS-CoV-2? Co-V-2? Yeah. By the way, COVID is such a terrible name, but it's stuck. Anyway, SARS-CoV-2 indicates evolutionary conserved functional regions of viral proteins. So this is looking at all kinds of proteins that are part of this novel coronavirus and how they match up against the previous other kinds of coronaviruses. I mean, there's a lot of beautiful figures. I was wondering if you could, I mean, there's so many questions I could ask here, but maybe at the, how do you get started at doing this paper? So how do you start to figure out the 3D structure of a novel virus? Yes. So there is actually a little story behind it. And so the story actually dated back in September of 2019. And you probably remember that back then we had another dangerous virus, EEE virus, Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus. Can you maybe linger on it? I have to admit I was sadly completely unaware. So that was actually a virus outbreak that happened in New England only. The danger in this virus was that it actually targeted your brain. So the word death from this virus, it was transferred, the main vector was mosquitoes. And obviously fall time is the time where you have a lot of them in New England. And on one hand, people realize this is actually a very dangerous thing. So it had an impact on the local economy. The schools were closed past six o'clock, no activities outside for the kids because the kids were suffering quite tremendously when infected from this virus. How do I not know about this? Was universities impacted? It was in the news. It was not impacted to a high degree in Boston necessarily, but in the Metro West area and actually spread around I think all the way to New Hampshire, Connecticut. And you mentioned affecting the brain. That's one other comment we should make. So you mentioned AC2 for the coronavirus. So these viruses kind of attach to something in the body. So it essentially attaches to these proteins in those cells in the body where those proteins are expressed, where they actually have them in abundance. So sometimes that could be in the lungs, that could be in the brain. So I think right now from what I read, they have the epithelial cells inside. So the cells essentially inside the cells that are covering the surface, so inside the nasal surfaces, the throat, the lung cells, and I believe liver as a couple of other organs where they are actually expressed in abundance. That's for the AC2, you said? For the AC2 receptors. So back to the story, the outbreak in the fall. So now the impact of this virus is significant. However, it's a pre-local problem to the point that this is something that we would call a neglected disease because it's not big enough to make the drug design companies to design a new antiviral or a new vaccine. It's not big enough to generate a lot of grants from the national funding agencies. So does it mean we cannot do anything about it? And so what I did is I taught a bioinformatics class in Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and we are very much a problem learning institution. So I thought that that would be a perfect project for the class. It's an ongoing case study. So we essentially designed a study where we tried to use bioinformatics to understand as much as possible about this virus. And a very substantial portion of the study was to understand the structures of the proteins, to understand how they interact with each other and with the host proteins, try to understand the evolution of this virus. So obviously, a very important question, where it will evolve further, how it happened here. So we did all these projects, and now I'm trying to put them into a paper where all these undergraduate students will be co-authors. But essentially, the projects were finished right about mid-December. And a couple of weeks later, I heard about this mysterious new virus that was discovered and was reported in Wuhan province. And immediately, I thought that, well, we just did that. Can't we do the same thing with this virus? And so we started waiting for the genome to be released, because that's essentially the first piece of information that is critical. Once you have the genome sequence, you can start doing a lot using bioinformatics. When you say genome sequence, that's referring to the sequence of letters that make up the RNA? The sequence that make up the entire information encoded in the protein. So that includes all 29 genes. What are genes? What's the encoding of information? So genes essentially is a basic functional unit that we can consider. So each gene in the virus would correspond to a protein. So gene by itself doesn't do its function. It needs to be converted or translated into the protein that will become the actual functional unit. Like you said, the printer. So we need the printer for that. Okay. So the first step is to figure out the genome, the sequence of things that will be then used for printing the protein. So then the next step, so once we have this, and so we use the existing information about SARS, because the SARS genomics has been done in abundance. So we have different strains of SARS and actually other related coronaviruses, MERS, the bat coronavirus. And we started by identifying the potential genes, because right now it's just a sequence. So it's a sequence that is roughly less than 30,000 nucleotide long. Just a raw sequence. It's a raw sequence. No other information really. And we now need to define the boundaries of the genes that would then be used to identify the proteins and protein structures. How hard is that problem? It's pretty straightforward, because we use the existing information about SARS proteins and SARS genes. So once again, you kind of... We are relying on the... Yes. And then once we get there, this is where sort of the first more traditional bioinformatics step begins. We're trying to use these protein sequences and get the 3D information about those proteins. So this is where we are relying heavily on the structure information, specifically from the protein data bank that we were talking about. And here you're looking for similar proteins. Yes. So the concept that we are operating when we do this kind of modeling, it's called homology or template-based modeling. So essentially using the concept that if you have two sequences that are similar in terms of the letters, the structures of the sequences are expected to be similar as well. And this is at the micro, at the very local scale and... At the scale of the whole protein. The whole protein. So actually, of course, the devil is in the details, and this is why we need actually pre-sophisticated modeling tools to do so. Once we get these structures of the individual proteins, we try to see whether or not these proteins act alone or they have to be forming protein complexes in order to perform this function. And again, so this is sort of the next level of the modeling because now you need to understand how proteins interact. And it could be the case that the protein interacts with itself and makes sort of a multimeric complex. The same protein just repeated multiple times, and we have quite a few such proteins in SARS-CoV-2, specifically spike protein needs three copies to function, envelope protein needs five copies to function, and there are some other multimeric complexes. That's what you mean by interacting with itself and you see multiple copies. So how do you make a good guess whether something's going to interact? Well, again, so there are two approaches. One is look at the previously solved complexes. Now we're looking not at the individual structures, but the structures of the whole complex. Complexes of multiple proteins. Yes, so it's a bunch of proteins essentially glued together. And when you say glued, that's the interaction. That's the interaction. So there are different forces, different sort of physical forces behind this. Sorry to keep asking dumb questions, but is the interaction fundamentally structural or is it functional in the way you're thinking about it? That's actually a very good way to ask this question because turns out that the interaction is structural, but in the way it forms the structure, it actually also carries out the function. So interaction is often needed to carry out very specific function or protein. But in terms of on the reverse side, figuring out you're really starting at the structure before you figure out the function. So there's a beautiful figure too in the paper of all the different proteins that make up, able to figure out the make up the novel coronavirus. What are we looking at? So these are like, that's through the step two that you mentioned, when you try to guess at the possible proteins, that's what you're going to get is these blue cyan blobs. Yes. So those are the individual proteins for which we have at least some information from the previous studies. So there is advantage and disadvantage of using previous studies. The biggest disadvantage is that we may not necessarily have the coverage of all 29 proteins. However, the biggest advantage is that the accuracy in which we can model these proteins is very high, much higher compared to ab initio methods that do not use any template information. But nevertheless, this figure also has such a beautiful, I love these pictures so much, it has like the pink parts, which are the parts that are different. So the difference you find is on the 2D sequence, and then you try to infer what that will look like on the 3D. So the difference actually is on 1D sequence. 1D, sorry, not 2D, right. And so this is one of these first questions that we tried to answer is that, well, if you take this new virus and you take the closest relatives, which are SARS and a couple of bad coronavirus strains, they are already the closest relatives that we are aware of. Now, what are the difference between this virus and its close relatives? And if you look, typically when you take a sequence, those differences could be quite far away from each other. So what 3D structure makes those difference to do, very often they tend to cluster together. And over sudden, the differences that may look completely unrelated actually relate to each other. And sometimes they are there because they attack the functional site. So they are there because this is the functional site that is highly mutated. So that's a computational approach to figuring something out. And when it comes together like that, that's kind of a nice clean indication that there's something, this could be actually indicative of what's happening. Yes. So we need this information. And the 3D structure gives us just a very intuitive way to look at this information. And then start asking questions such as, so this place of this protein that is highly mutated, is it the functional part of the protein? So does this part of the protein interact with some other proteins or maybe with some other ligands, small molecules? So we will try now to functionally inform this 3D structure. So you have a bunch of these mutated parts. How many are there in the novel coronavirus when you compare to SARS? We're talking about hundreds, thousands, these pink regions. No, no, much less than that. And it's very interesting that if you look at that, so the first thing that you start seeing, you look at patterns. And the first pattern that becomes obvious is that some of the proteins in the new coronavirus are pretty much intact. So they're pretty much exactly the same as SARS, as the bad coronavirus, whereas some others are heavily mutated. So it looks like that the evolution is not occurring uniformly across the entire viral genome, but actually target very specific proteins. And what do you do with that, like from the Sherlock Holmes perspective? Well, so one of the most interesting findings we had was the fact that the binding sites on the viral surfaces that get targeted by the known small molecules, they were pretty much not affected at all. And so that means that the same small drugs or small drug-like compounds can be efficient for the new coronavirus. So this all actually maps to the drug compounds too. So you're actually mapping out what old stuff is going to work on this thing, and then possibilities for new stuff to work by mapping out that things have mutated. Yes. So we essentially know which parts behave differently and which parts are likely to behave similar. And again, of course, all our predictions need to be validated by experiments. But hopefully that sort of helps us to delineate the regions of this virus that can be promising in terms of the drug discovery. You kind of mentioned this already, but maybe you can elaborate. So how different from the structural and functional perspective does the new coronavirus appear to be relative to SARS? We now are trying to understand the overall structural characteristics of this virus, because that's our next step, trying to model the single viral particle of this virus. So that means you have the individual proteins. Like you said, you have to figure out what their interaction is. Is that where this graph kind of interactome? So the interactome is essentially our prediction on the potential interactions, some of them that we already deciphered from the structural knowledge, but some of them that are essentially deciphered from the knowledge of the existing interactions that people previously obtained for SARS, for MERS, or other related viruses. Is there kind of interactomes? Am I pronouncing that correctly by the way? Yeah, interactome. Are those already converged towards for SARS? I think there are a couple of papers that now investigate the large-scale sets of interactions between the new SARS and its host. And so I think that's an ongoing study. And the success of that, the result would be an interactome. Yes. And so when you say not trying to figure out the entire particle, the entire thing. So structure, right? So what this viral particle looks like, right? So as I said, the surface of it is an envelope, which is essentially a so-called lipid bilayer with proteins integrated into the surface. So an average particle is around 18 nanometers, right? So this particle can have about 50 to 100 spike proteins. So at least we suspect it, and based on the micrographs images, it's very comparable to MHV virus in mice and SARS virus. Micrographs are actual pictures of the actual... Virus. Okay, so these are models. These are the actual images, right? What are they? Sorry for the tangents, but what are these things? So when you look on the Internet, the models and the pictures are... and the models you have here are just gorgeous and beautiful. When you actually take pictures of them with a micrograph, what do we look... Well, they typically are not perfect. So most of the images that you see now is the sphere with those spikes. Do you actually see the spikes? Yes, you do see the spikes. And now, our collaborators for Texas A&M University, Benjamin Newman, he actually... In the recent paper about SARS, he proposed, and there's some actually evidence behind it, that the particle is not a sphere, but it actually is an elongated ellipsoid-like particle. So that's what we are trying to incorporate into our model. And if you look at the actual micrographs, you see that those particles are not symmetric. So there are some of them. And of course, it could be due to the treatment of the material. It could be due to some noise in the imaging. So there's a lot of uncertainty in all this. So structurally figuring out the entire part... By the way, again, sorry for the tangents, but why the term particle? Or is it just something that's stuck? It's a single... We call it the virion. So virion particle, it's essentially a single virus. Single virus, but it just feels like... Because particle to me, from the physics perspective, feels like the most basic unit. Because there seems to be so much going on inside the virus. It doesn't feel like a particle to me. Yeah, it's probably... I think virion is a good way to call it. Okay, so trying to figure out the entirety of the system. Yes. So virion has 50 to 100 trimer spikes. It has roughly 200 to 400 membrane protein dimers. And those are arranged in the very nice lattice, so you can actually see it's like a carpet. On the surface again. Exactly, on the surface. And occasionally you also see this envelope protein inside. Is that the one we don't know what it does? Exactly. The one that forms the pentamer, this very nice pentameric ring. And so this is what we're trying to put now all our knowledge together and see whether we can actually generate this overall virion model with an idea to understand, well, first of all, to understand how it looks like, how far it is from those images that were generated. But the implications are there is a potential for the nanoparticle design that will mimic this virion particle. Is the process of nanoparticle design meaning artificially designing something that looks similar? Yes. The one that can potentially compete with the actual virion particles and therefore reduce the effect of the infection. So is this the idea of like what is a vaccine? So there are two ways of essentially treating and in the case of vaccine is preventing the infection. So vaccine is a way to train our immune system. So our immune system becomes aware of this new danger and therefore is capable of generating the antibodies then will essentially bind to the spike proteins because that's the main target for the vaccines design and block its functioning. If you have the spike with the antibody on top, it can no longer interact with AC2 receptor. So the process of designing a vaccine then is you have to understand enough about the structure of the virus itself to be able to create an artificial particle? Well, I mean, so the nanoparticle is a very exciting and new research. So there are already established ways to make vaccines and there are several different ones. So there is one where essentially the virus gets through the cell culture multiple times. So it becomes essentially adjusted to the specific embryonic cell and as a result becomes less compatible with the host human cells. So therefore it's sort of the idea of the live vaccine where the particles are there, but they are not so efficient. So they cannot replicate as rapidly as before the vaccine and they can be introduced to the immune system. The immune system will learn and the person who gets this vaccine won't get sick or will have mild symptoms. So then there is sort of different types of the way to introduce the non-functional parts of this virus or the virus where some of the information is stripped down. For example, the virus with no genetic material, so with no RNA genome. Exactly. So it cannot replicate. It cannot essentially perform most of its functions. This is fascinating. What is the biggest hurdle to design one of these, to arrive at one of these? Is it the work that you're doing in the fundamental understanding of this new virus or is it from our perspective complicated world of experimental validation and sort of going through the whole process of showing this is actually going to work with FDA approval, all that kind of stuff? I think it's both. I mean, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms will allow us to design, to have more efficient designs of the vaccines. However, once you design the vaccine, it needs to be tested. But when you look at the 18 months and the different projections, it seems like an exceptionally, historically speaking, maybe you can correct me, but even 18 months seems like a very accelerated timeline. It is. I mean, I remember reading in a book about some previous vaccines that it could take up to 10 years to design and properly test a vaccine before its mass production. So yeah, everything is accelerated these days. I mean, for better, for worse, but we definitely need that. Well, especially with the coronavirus, I mean, the scientific community is really stepping up and working together. The collaborative aspect is really interesting. You mentioned, so the vaccine is one, and then there's antivirals, antiviral drugs. So antiviral drugs, so where, you know, vaccines are typically needed to prevent the infection, right? But once you have an infection, one, you know, so what we try to do, we try to stop it. So we try to stop virus from functioning. And so the antiviral drugs are designed to block some critical functioning of the proteins from the virus. So there are a number of interesting candidates. And I think, you know, if you ask me, I think Remdesivir is perhaps the most promising. It has been shown to be, you know, an efficient and effective antiviral for SARS. Originally, it was the antiviral drug developed for a completely different virus, I think, for Ebola and Marburg. At a high level, do you know how it works? So it tries to mimic one of the nucleotides in RNA, and essentially that stops the replication. So messes, I guess that's what, so antiviral drugs mess with some aspect of this process. So, you know, so essentially we try to stop certain functions of the virus. There are some other ones, you know, that are designed to inhibit the protease, the thing that clips protein sequences. There is one that was originally designed for malaria, which is a bacterial disease. This is so cool. But that's exactly where your work steps in, is you're figuring out the functional and the structure of these different, so like providing candidates for where drugs can plug in. Exactly. Well, yes, because, you know, one thing that we don't know is whether or not, so let's say we have a perfect drug candidate that is efficient against SARS and against MERS. Now, is it going to be efficient against new SARS-CoV-2? We don't know that, and there are multiple aspects that can affect this efficiency. So, for instance, if the binding site, so the part of the protein where this ligand gets attached, if this site is mutated, then the ligand may not be attachable to this part any longer. And, you know, our work and the work of other bioinformatics groups, you know, essentially are trying to understand whether or not that will be the case. And it looks like for the ligands that we looked at, the ligand binding sites are pretty much intact, which is very promising. So if we could just like zoom out for a second. Are you optimistic? So there's two, well, there's three possible ends to the coronavirus pandemic. So one is there's, or drugs or vaccines get figured out very quickly, probably drugs first. The other is the pandemic runs its course for this wave, at least. And then the third is, you know, things go much worse in some in some dark, bad, very bad direction. Do you see, let's focus on the first two. Do you see the anti drugs of the work you're doing being relevant for us right now? In us stopping the pandemic, or do you hope that the pandemic will run its course? So the social distancing, things like wearing masks, all those discussions that we're having will be the method with which we fight coronavirus in the short term. Or do you think that it'll have to be anti viral drugs? I think I think antivirals would be, I would view that as the at least the short term solution. I see more and more cases in the news of those new drug candidates being administered in hospitals. And I mean, this is right now the best what we have. Or do we need it to reopen the economy? I mean, we definitely need it. I cannot speculate on how that will affect reopening of the economy because we are, you know, we are kind of deep in into the pandemic. And it's not just the states, it's also worldwide. Of course, there is also the possibility of the second wave, as you mentioned. And this is why we need to be super careful. We need to follow all the precautions that the doctors tell us to do. Are you worried about the mutation of the virus? It's, of course, a real possibility. Now, how to what extent this virus can mutate? It's an open question. I mean, we know that it is able to mutate, to jump from one species to another and to become transmittable between humans. Right. So, will it, you know, so let's imagine that we have the new antiviral. Will this virus become eventually resistant to this antiviral? We don't know. I mean, this is what needs to be studied. It's such a beautiful and terrifying process that a virus, some viruses may be able to mutate to respond to the mutate around the thing we've put before. Can you explain that process? Like, how does that happen? Is that just the way of evolution? I would say so, yes. I mean, it's the evolutionary mechanisms. There is nothing imprinted into this virus that makes it, you know, it just the way it evolves. And actually, it's the way it co-evolves with its host. It's just amazing, especially the evolutionary mechanisms, especially amazing given how simple the virus is. It's incredible that it's, I mean, it's beautiful. It's beautiful because it's one of the cleanest examples of evolution working. Well, I think, I mean, one of the sort of the reasons for its simplicity is because it does not require all the necessary functions to be stored. So it actually can hijack the majority of the necessary functions from the host cell. So the ability to do so, in my view, reduces the complexity of this machine drastically. Although if you look at the most recent discoveries, right, so the scientists discovered viruses that are as large as bacteria, right? These Mimim viruses and Mama viruses, it actually, those discoveries made scientists to reconsider the origins of the virus, you know, and what are the mechanisms and how, you know, what are the mechanisms, the evolutionary mechanisms that leads to the appearance of the viruses. By the way, I mean, you did mention that viruses are, I think you mentioned that they're not living. Yes, they are not living organisms. But let me ask that question again. Why do you think they're not living organisms? Well, because they are dependent. The majority of the functions of the virus are dependent on the host. So let me do the devil's advocate. Let me be the philosophical devil's advocate here and say, well, humans, which we would say are living, need our host planet to survive. So you can basically take every living organism that we think of as definitively living. It's always going to have some aspects of its host that it needs of its environment. So is that really the key aspect of why a virus is that dependence? Because it seems to be very good at doing so many things that we consider to be intelligent. It's just that dependence part. Well, I mean, it's difficult to answer in this way. I mean, the way I think about the virus is in order for it to function, it needs to have the critical component, the critical tools that it doesn't have. So, I mean, in my way, it's not autonomous. That's how I separate the idea of the living organism on a very high level between the living organism and... And you have some... I mean, these are just terms and perhaps they don't mean much, but we have some kind of sense of what autonomous means and that humans are autonomous. You've also done excellent work in the epidemiological modeling, the simulation of these things. So the zooming out outside of the body, doing the agent-based simulation. So that's where you actually simulate individual human beings and then the spread of viruses from one to the other. How does at a high level agent-based simulation work? All right. So it's also one of these irony of timing. Because I mean, we've worked on this project for the past five years and the New Year's Eve, I got an email from my PG student that the last experiments were completed. And three weeks after that, we get this diamond princess story and emailing each other with the same news saying... So the diamond princess is a cruise ship. And what was the project that you worked on? So the project, I mean, it's... The code name, it started with a bunch of undergraduates. The code name was zombies on a cruise ship. So they wanted to essentially model the zombie apocalypse on a cruise ship. And after having some fun, we then thought about the fact that if you look at the cruise ships, I mean, the infectious outbreak has been one of the biggest threats to the cruise ship economy. So perhaps the most frequently occurring is the Norwalk virus. And this is essentially one of these stomach flus that you have. And it can be quite devastating. Occasionally, there are cruise ships, they get canceled, they get returned back to the origin. And so we wanted to study, and this is very different from the traditional epidemiological studies where the scale is much larger. So we wanted to study this in a confined environment, which is a cruise ship. It could be a school, it could be other places such as this large company where people are in interaction. And the benefit of this model is we can actually track that in the real time. So we can actually see the whole course of the evolution, the whole course of the interaction between the infected host and the host and the pathogen, et cetera. So agent-based system or multi-agent system to be more precisely is a good way to approach this problem because we can introduce the behavior of the passengers, of the cruise. And what we did for the first time, that's where we introduced some novelty is we introduced a pathogen agent explicitly. So that allowed us to essentially model the behavior on the host side as well on the pathogen side. And over sudden we can have a flexible model that allows us to integrate all the key parameters about the infections. So for example, the virus, the ways of transmitting the virus between the host, how long does virus survive on the surface, the formite? What is, how much of the viral particles does a host shed when he or she is asymptomatic versus symptomatic? You can encode all of that into this pathogen. It's just for people who don't know. So agent-based simulation, usually the agent represents a single human being. And then there's some graphs, like contact graphs that represent the interaction between those human beings. So yes, so we, so essentially, you know, so agents are, you know, individual programs that are run in parallel and we can provide instructions for these agents how to interact with each other, how to exchange information, in this case, exchange the infection. But in this case, in your case, you've added a pathogen as an agent. I mean, that's kind of fascinating. It's a, it's kind of a brilliant, like a brilliant way to condense the parameters to aggregate, to bring the parameters together that represent the pathogen, the virus. Yes. That's fascinating, actually. So yeah, it was, you know, we realized that, you know, by bringing in the virus, we can actually start modeling. I mean, we're not no longer bounded by very specific sort of aspects of the specific virus. So we end up, we started with, you know, Norwalk virus and of course zombies, but we continued to modeling Ebola virus outbreak, flu, SARS. And because I felt that we need to add a little bit more sort of excitement for our undergraduate students. So we actually modeled the virus from the contagion movie. Yes. So MEV1. And, you know, unfortunately that virus, and we tried to extract as much information. Luckily, the, this movie was, the scientific consultant was Jan Lipkin, a virologist from Columbia University who is actually, who provided, I think he designed this virus for this movie based on Nipah virus. And I think with some ideas behind SARS of flu, like airborne viruses. And, you know, the movie surprisingly contained enough details for us to extract and to model it. I was hoping you would like publish a paper of how this virus works. Yeah, we are planning to publish. I would love it if you did. But it would be nice if the, you know, if the, the origin of the virus, but you're now actually being a scientist and studying the virus from that perspective. But the origin of the virus, you know, the first time, actually, so this movie is assignment number one in my bioinformatics class that they give. Because it also tells you that, you know, bioinformatics can be of use. Cause if, I don't know, you watched it? Have you watched it? A long time ago, yeah. So there is, you know, approximately a week from the, you know, virus detection, we see a screenshot of scientists looking at the structure of the surface protein. And this is where I tell my students that, you know, if you ask a experimental biologist, they will tell you that it's impossible because it takes months, maybe years to get the crystal structure of this, you know, the structure that is represented. If you ask a bioinformatician, they tell you, sure, why not? Just get it modeled. And yes, but it was very interesting to see that there is actually, you know, and if you do screenshots, you actually see the phylogenetic tree, the evolutionary tree that relate this virus with other viruses. So it was a lot of scientific thought put into the movie. And one thing that I was actually, you know, it was interesting to learn is that the origin of this virus was there were two animals that led to the, you know, the zoonotic origin of this virus were fruit bat and a pig. So, you know, so, so, so this is, this is, this doesn't feel like we're this, this definitely feels like we're living in a simulation. Okay. But maybe a big picture. Aging based simulation now larger scale, sort of not focused on a crucial, but larger scale are used now to drive some policy. So politicians use them to tell stories and narratives and try to figure out how, how to move forward under so much, so much uncertainty. But in your sense, our agent based simulation useful for actually predicting the future or are they useful mostly for comparing relative comparison of different intervention methods? Well, I think both because, you know, in the case of new coronavirus, we, we essentially learning that the current intervention methods may not be efficient enough. One thing that one important aspect that I find to be so critical and yet something that was overlooked, you know, during the past pandemics is the effect of the symptomatic period. This virus is different because it has such a long symptomatic period and over sudden that creates a completely new game when trying to contain this virus. In terms of the dynamics of the infection. Exactly. Do you also, I don't know how close you're tracking this, but do you also think that there's a different like rate of infection for when you're asymptomatic like that? That aspect or does a virus not care? So there were a couple of works. So one important parameter that tells us how contagious the person with asymptomatic versus asymptomatic is looking at the number of viral particles this person sheds, you know, as a function of time. So far what I saw is the study that tells us that the, you know, the person during the asymptomatic period is already contagious and it sheds, the person sheds enough viruses to infect another host. And I think there's so many excellent papers coming out, but I think I just saw maybe a nature paper that said the first week is when you're symptomatic or asymptomatic, you're the most contagious. So the highest level of the like the plot sort of in the 14 day period, they collected a bunch of subjects and I think the first week is when it's the most. Yeah, I think, I mean, I'm waiting to see sort of more populated studies with higher numbers. My one of my favorite studies was again, very recent one where scientists determined that tears are not contagious. So there is, you know, so there is no viral shedding done through tears. So they found one like moist thing that's not contagious. And I mean, there's a lot of, I'm personally been, because I'm going to survey paper somehow that's looking at masks. And there's been so much interesting debates on the efficacy of masks and there's a lot of work and there's a lot of interesting work on whether this virus is airborne. I mean, it's a totally open question is it's leaning one way right now, but it's a totally open question whether it can travel and aerosols long distances. I mean, do you have a, do you think about this stuff? Do you track this stuff? Are you focused on them? Yeah, I mean, I mean, this is. This is a very important aspect for our epidemiology study. I think the, I mean, and it's sort of a very simple sort of idea, but I agree with people who say that the mask, the masks work in both ways. So it not only protects you from the incoming viral particles, it also, you know, it makes the potentially contagious person not to spread the viral particles. Who is when they're asymptomatic may not even know that they're. Exactly. In fact, it seems to be there's evidence that they don't surgical and certainly homemade masks, which is what's needed now actually because there's a huge shortage of they don't work as to protect you that well. They work much better to protect others. So it's, it's a motivation for us to all wear one. Exactly, because I mean, you know, you don't know where, you know, and about 30% as far as I remember, at least 30% of the asymptomatic cases are completely asymptomatic. Yeah. Right. So you don't really cough. You don't. I mean, you don't have any symptoms yet. You shed viruses. Do you think it's possible that we'll all wear masks? I wore a mask at a grocery store and you just, you get looks. I mean, this was like a week ago. Maybe it's already changed because I think CDC or somebody's, I think the CDC has said that we should be wearing masks like the LA they starting to happen. But do you, it just seems like something that this country will really struggle doing or no. I hope not. I mean, you know, it was interesting. I was looking through the old pictures during the Spanish flu. And you could see that the, you know, pretty much everyone was wearing masks with some exceptions. And there were like, you know, sort of iconic photograph of the, I think it was San Francisco, this tram who was refusing to let in a, you know, someone without the mask. So I think, well, you know, it's also, you know, it's related to the fact of, you know, how much we are scared. Right. So how much do we treat this problem seriously? And, you know, my take on it is we should, because it is very serious. Yeah. I, from a psychology perspective, just worry about the entirety, the entire big mess of a psychology experiment that this is whether mask will help it or hurt it. You know, the masks have a way of distancing us from others by removing the emotional expression and all that kind of stuff. But at the same time, mask also signal that I care about your wellbeing. So it's a really interesting trade off. That's just a. Yeah, it's interesting, right? About distancing. Aren't we distanced enough? Right. Exactly. And when we try to come closer together, when they do reopen the economy, that's going to be a long road of rebuilding trust and not all being huge germaphobes. Let me ask sort of, you have a bit of a Russian accent. Russian or no Russian accent? Were you born in Russia? Yes. And you're too kind. I have a pretty thick Russian accent. What are your favorite memories of Russia? So I moved first to Canada and then to the United States back in 99. So by that time I was 22. So whatever Russian accent I got back then, it stuck with me for the rest of my life. So by the time the Soviet Union collapsed, I was a kid, but sort of old enough to realize that there are changes. Did you want to be a scientist back then? Oh, yes. I mean, the first sort of 10 years of my sort of juvenile life, I wanted to be a pilot of a passenger jet plane. Wow. So yes, it was like I was getting ready to go to a college to get the degree. But I've been always fascinated by science. And so not just by math, of course, math was one of my favorite subjects, but biology, chemistry, physics, somehow I liked those four subjects together. And yes, so essentially after a certain period of time, I wanted to actually, back then it was a very popular sort of area of science called cybernetics. So it's not really computer science, but it was like computational robotics in this sense. And so I really wanted to do that. But then I realized that my biggest passion was in mathematics. And later when studying in Moscow State University, I also realized that I really want to apply the knowledge. So I really wanted to mix the mathematical knowledge that I get with real life problems. And that could be you mentioned chemistry and now biology. And I sort of, does it make you sad? Maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like it's difficult to be in collaboration to do open big science in Russia. From my distant perspective in computer science, I don't, I'm not, I can go to conferences in Russia. I sadly don't have many collaborators in Russia. I don't know many people doing great AI work in Russia. Does it make, does that make you sad? Am I wrong in seeing it this way? Well, I mean, I am, I have to tell you, I'm privileged to have collaborators in bioinformatics in Russia. And I think this is the bioinformatics school in Russia is very strong. In Moscow? In Moscow, in Novosibirsk, in St. Petersburg, have great collaborators in Kazan. And so at least, in terms of my area of research. There's strong people there. Yeah, strong people, a lot of great ideas, very open to collaborations. So I, perhaps, you know, it's my luck, but, you know, I haven't experienced, you know, any difficulties in establishing collaborations. That's bioinformatics though. It could be bioinformatics too. And it could, yeah, it could be person by person related, but I just don't feel the warmth and love that I would, you know, you talk about the seminal people who are French in artificial intelligence. France welcomes them with open arms in so many ways. I just don't feel the love from Russia. I do on the human beings, like people in general, like friends and just cool, interesting people. But from the scientific community, no conferences, no big conferences. Yeah, it's actually, you know, I'm trying to think. Yeah, I cannot recall any big AI conferences in Russia. It has an effect on, for me, I haven't sadly been back to Russia. But my problem is it's very difficult. So now I have to renounce the citizenship. Oh, is that right? I mean, I'm a citizen in the United States and it makes it very difficult. There's a mess now, right? So I want to be able to travel like, you know, legitimately. And it's not an obvious process that will make it super easy. I mean, that's part of that. Like, you know, it should be super easy for me to travel there. Well, you know, hopefully this unfortunate circumstances that we are in will actually promote the remote collaborations. And I think what we are experiencing right now is that you still can do science, you know, being quarantined in your own homes, especially when it comes, I mean, you know, I certainly understand there is a very challenging time for experimental scientists. I mean, I have many collaborators who are affected by that, but for computational scientists. Yeah, we're really leading into the remote communication. Nevertheless, I had to force you to talk to you in person because there's something that you just can't do in terms of conversation like this. I don't know why. But in person is very much needed. So I really appreciate you doing it. You have a collection of science bobbleheads. Yes. Which look amazing. Which which bobblehead is your favorite and which real world version, which scientist is your favorite? Yeah. So, yeah, by the way, I was trying to bring it in, but they are quarantined now in my in my office. They sort of demonstrate the social distance. So they're nicely spaced away from each other. But so, you know, it's interesting. So I've been collecting those bobbleheads for the past, maybe 12 or 13 years. And it, you know, interestingly enough, it started with the two bobbleheads of Watson and Creek. And interestingly enough, my last bobblehead in this collection for now and my favorite one, because I felt so good when I got it, was the Rosalind Franklin. And so, you know, when I got it, who is the full group? So I have Watson, Creek, Newton, Einstein, Marie Curie, Tesla. Of course, Charles Darwin, Charles Darwin. And Rosalind Franklin. I am definitely missing quite a few of my favorite scientists. And but so, you know, if I were to add to this collection, so I would add, of course, Kalmagorov. That's, you know, I've been always fascinated by his, well, his dedication to science, but also his dedication to educating young people, the next generation. So it's very inspiring. He's one of the, okay, yeah, he's one of the Russia's greats. Yes. Yes. So he also, you know, the school, the high school that I attended was named after him and he was great. So he founded this school and he actually taught there. Is this in Moscow? Yes. So, but then, I mean, you know, other people that I would definitely like to see in my collections was, would be Alan Turing, would be John Von Neumann. Yeah, you're a little bit late on the computer scientists. Yes. Well, I mean, they don't, they don't make them, you know, I still am amazed they haven't made Alan Turing. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And I would also add Linus Pauling. Linus Pauling. Who is Linus Pauling? Yeah. So this is, this is to me is one of the greatest chemists and the person who actually discovered the secondary structure of proteins, who was very close to solving the DNA structure. And, you know, people argue, but some of them were pretty sure that if not for this, you know, photograph 51 by Rosalind Franklin that, you know, Watson and Crick got access to, he would be, he would be the one who would solve it. Science is a funny race. It is. Let me ask the biggest and the most ridiculous question. So you've kind of studied the human body and its defenses and these enemies that are about from a biological perspective, bioinformatics perspective, a computer scientist perspective. How has that made you see your own life, sort of the meaning of it, or just even seeing your, what it means to be human? Well, it certainly makes me realizing how fragile the human life is. If you think about this little tiny thing can impact the life of the whole human kind to such extent. So, you know, it's something to appreciate and to, you know, to remember that, you know, we are fragile. We have to bond together as a society. And, you know, it also gives me sort of hope that what we do as scientists is useful. I don't think there's a better way to end it, Dmitry. Thank you so much for talking today. It was an honor.

{"text":"So if you live on planet Earth and you're one of seven billion people that eats food every day, I need you to pay attention, because over the next three decades, we will need to address one of the most critical global challenges of our generation. And I'm not talking about climate change. I'm talking about food and agriculture. In 2050, our global population is projected to reach 9.8 billion, with 68 percent of us living in urban city centers. In order to feed this massive population, we will need to increase our agricultural output by 70 percent over current levels. Just to put this number into perspective, we will need to grow more food in the next 35 to 40 years than the previous 10,000 years combined. Put simply, not only is our global population becoming bigger, but it's also getting denser, and we will need to grow significantly more food using significantly less land and resources. Complicating our current efforts to address these major demographic shifts are the challenges facing the agricultural industry today. Globally, one third of all the food that we produce is wasted, acquitting to 1.6 billion tons of food that spoiled on the way to the market or expired in our refrigerators or were simply thrown out by supermarkets and restaurants at the end of the day. Every single year, up to 600 million people will get sick eating contaminated food, highlighting the challenge that we have of maintaining global food safety. And, maybe unsurprisingly, the agricultural industry is the single largest consumer of fresh water, accounting for 70 percent of global usage. Now, you'll be relieved to know that the agricultural industry and that the global movement by universities, companies and NGOs is putting together comprehensive research and developing novel technology to address all of these issues. And many have been doing it for decades. But one of the more recent innovations in food production being deployed in industrial parks in North America, in the urban city centers of Asia, and even in the arid deserts of the Middle East is controlled environment agriculture. Controlled environment agriculture is actually just a fancy way of saying weather- or climate-proof farming, and many of these farms grow food three-dimensionally in vertical racks, as opposed to the two dimensions of conventional farms. And so this type of food production is also referred to as indoor vertical farming. I've been involved in the indoor vertical farming space for the past five and a half years, developing technology to make this type of food production more efficient and affordable. This picture was taken outside of a decommissioned shipping container that we converted into an indoor farm and then launched into the heart and the heat of Dubai. Indoor vertical farming is a relatively recent phenomena, commercially speaking, and the reason for this is that consumers care more about food safety and where their food comes from, and also, the necessary technology to make this possible is more readily available and lower cost, and the overall cost of food production globally is actually increasing, making this type of food production more competitive. So if you want to build an indoor vertical farm, you will need to replace some of the conventional elements of farming with artificial substitutes, starting with sunlight. In indoor vertical farms, natural sunlight is replaced with artificial lighting like LEDs. While there are many different types of LEDs being used, the one that we decided to install here is called \"full spectrum LEDs,\" which was optimized for the type of vegetables that we were growing. Also, in order to maximize production for a given space, indoor vertical farms also utilize and install racking systems to grow vegetables vertically, and some of the biggest facilities stack their production 14 to 16 floors high. Now most of these farms are hydroponic or aeroponic systems, which means that instead of using soil, they use a substitute material like polyurethane sponges, biodegradable peat moss and even use inorganic materials like perlite and clay pellets. Another unique aspects about these farms is that they use a precise nutrient formula that is circulated and recycled throughout the facility, and this is pumped directly to the vegetables' root zone to promote plant growth. And lastly, these farms use a sophisticated monitoring and automation system to significantly increase productivity, efficiency and consistency, and these tools also provide the added benefit of producing food that is more traceable and safe. Some of the obvious benefits of growing food in this way is that you have year-round vegetable production, you have consistent quality and you have predictable output. Some of the other major benefits include significant resource use efficiencies, particularly water. For every kilogram of vegetables grown in this way, hundreds of liters of water is conserved compared to conventional farming methods. And with the water savings come similar savings in the use of fertilizer. One of the highest-yielding farms grows over 350 times more food per square meter than a conventional farm. And weatherproofing means complete control of incoming contaminants and pests, completely eliminating the need for the use of chemical pesticides. And not to be mistaken, these farms can produce enormous amounts of food, with one of the biggest facilities producing 30,000 heads of vegetables a day. However, as with any new technology or innovation, there are some drawbacks. As you would imagine, growing food in this way can be incredibly energy-intensive. Also, these farms can only produce a small variety of vegetables commercially and the overall cost of the production still is quite high. And in order to address these issues, some of the biggest and most sophisticated farms are making significant investments, starting with energy efficiency. In order to reduce the high energy usage, there are efforts to develop higher-efficiency LEDs, to develop lasers optimized for plant growth and using even fiber-optic cables like these to channel sunlight directly into an indoor vertical farm during the day to reduce the need for artificial lighting. Also, to reduce the labor costs associated with hiring a more sophisticated, more urban and also more high-skilled labor force, robotics in automation is used extensively in large-scale facilities. And you can never really be too resource-efficient. Building indoor vertical farms in and around urban city centers can help to shorten the agricultural supply chain and also help to maintain the nutritional content in vegetables. Also, there are food deserts in many countries that have little to no access to nutritious vegetables, and as this industry matures, it will become possible to provide more equitable access to high-quality, highly nutritious vegetables in even the most underprivileged of communities. And finally, and this is really exciting for me personally, indoor vertical farming can actually be integrated seamlessly into the cityscape to help repurpose idle, underutilized and unused urban infrastructure. In fact, this is already happening today. Ride-sharing services have taken hundreds of thousands of cars off the road and they have significantly reduced the need for parking. This is a farm that we installed in central Beijing in an underutilized underground parking structure to grow vegetables for the nearby hotels. Underutilized infrastructure is not simply limited to large-scale civil engineering projects, and they can also include smaller spaces like idle restaurant corners. This is an example of a farm that we installed directly into the partition of a hotel entrance in order to grow fresh herbs and microgreens on-site for the chefs. Honestly, if you look around, you will find underutilized space everywhere, under, around and inside of urban developments. This is a farm that we installed into an empty office corner to grow fresh vegetables for the employees in nearby cafes. I get to be a part of all these cool projects and working in the agricultural industry to improve access and affordability to fresh and nutritious produce, hopefully soon by anyone anywhere, has been the greatest joy and also the most humbling and intellectually challenging thing I've ever done. And now that I've convinced you that agriculture can be quite sexy, you'll be surprised and shocked to know that I still have trouble fully articulating how and why I decided to work, and continue to work, in the agricultural industry. But a couple of years ago, I found a rather unique answer hiding in plain sight. You see, I read an article about how your name, particularly your last name, can have a strong influence on everything from your personality to your professional career. This is my Japanese last name: Oda. And the characters translate literally into \"small farm.\" (Laughter) Thank you. (Applause)","label":1}

{"text":" The following is a conversation with Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and author of The Selfish Gene, The Blind Watchmaker, The God Delusion, The Magic of Reality, and The Greatest Show of Earth and his latest, All-Growing God. He is the originator and popularizer of a lot of fascinating ideas in evolutionary biology and science in general, including, funny enough, the introduction of the word meme in his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene, which, in the context of a gene-centered view of evolution, is an exceptionally powerful idea. He's outspoken, bold, and often fearless in the defense of science and reason, and in this way, is one of the most influential thinkers of our time. This conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic. For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis, I'm sending love your way.

And now here's my conversation with Richard Dawkins. Do you think there's intelligent life out there in the universe? Well, if we accept that there's intelligent life here and we accept that the number of planets in the universe is gigantic, I mean, 10 to 22 stars has been estimated, it seems to me highly likely that there is not only life in the universe elsewhere, but also intelligent life. If you deny that, then you're committed to the view that the things that happened on this planet are staggeringly improbable. I mean, ludicrously, off the charts improbable. And I don't think it's that improbable. Certainly the origin of life itself, there are really two steps, the origin of life, which is probably fairly improbable, and then the subsequent evolution to intelligent life, which is also fairly improbable. So the juxtaposition of those two, you could say is pretty improbable, but not 10 to the 22. It's an interesting question, maybe you're coming onto it, how we would recognize intelligence from outer space if we encountered it. The most likely way we would come across them would be by radio. It's highly unlikely they'd ever visit us. But it's not that unlikely that we would pick up radio signals. And then we would have to have some means of deciding that it was intelligent. People involved in the SETI program discuss how they would do it, and things like prime numbers would be an obvious thing to, an obvious way for them to broadcast, to say we are intelligent, we are here. I suspect it probably would be obvious, actually. Well, it's interesting, prime numbers, so the mathematical patterns, it's an open question whether mathematics is the same for us as it would be for aliens. I suppose we could assume that ultimately, if we regard it as a mathematical pattern, if we're governed by the same laws of physics, then we should be governed by the same laws of mathematics. I think so. I suspect that they will have Pythagoras theorem, et cetera. I don't think that their mathematics will be that different. Do you think evolution would also be a force on the alien planets as well? I stuck my neck out and said that if ever that we do discover life elsewhere, it will be Darwinian life, in the sense that it will work by some kind of natural selection, the non-random survival of randomly generated codes. It doesn't mean that the genetic, it would have to have some kind of genetics, but it doesn't have to be DNA genetics, probably wouldn't be actually. But I think it would have to be Darwinian, yes. So some kind of selection process. Yes, in the general sense, it would be Darwinian. So let me ask kind of an artificial intelligence engineering question. So you've been an outspoken critic of, I guess what could be called intelligent design, which is an attempt to describe the creation of a human mind, a body, by some religious folks, religious folks used to describe. So broadly speaking, evolution is, as far as I know, again, you can correct me, is the only scientific theory we have for the development of intelligent life. Like there's no alternative theory, as far as I understand. None has ever been suggested, and I suspect it never will be. Well, of course, whenever somebody says that, 100 years later. I know, it's a risk. It's a risk. But what a bet, I mean, I'm pretty confident. But it would look, sorry, yes, it would probably look very similar, but it's almost like Einstein's general relativity versus Newtonian physics. It'll be maybe an alteration of the theory or something like that, but it won't be fundamentally different. But okay, so now for the past 70 years, even before the AI community has been trying to engineer intelligence, in a sense to do what intelligent design says was done here on Earth. What's your intuition? Do you think it's possible to build intelligence, to build computers that are intelligent, or do we need to do something like the evolutionary process? Like there's no shortcuts here. That's an interesting question. I'm committed to the belief that it's ultimately possible because I think there's nothing non-physical in our brains. I think our brains work by the laws of physics. And so it must in principle, it'd be possible to replicate that. In practice though, it might be very difficult. And as you suggest, it may be the only way to do it is by something like an evolutionary process. I'd be surprised, I suspect that it will come, but it's certainly been slower incoming than some of the early pioneers thought. I thought it would be, yeah. But in your sense, is the evolutionary process efficient? So you can see it as exceptionally wasteful in one perspective, but at the same time, maybe that is the only path. It's a paradox, isn't it? I mean, on the one side, it is deplorably wasteful. It's fundamentally based on waste. On the other hand, it does produce magnificent results. The design of a soaring bird, an albatross, a vulture, an eagle is superb. An engineer would be proud to have done it. On the other hand, an engineer would not be proud to have done some of the other things that evolution has served up. Some of the sort of botched jobs that you can easily understand because of their historical origins, but they don't look well designed. Do you have examples of bad design? My favorite example is the current laryngeal nerve. I've used this many times. This is a nerve, it's one of the cranial nerves which goes from the brain and the end organ that it supplies is the voice box, the larynx, but it doesn't go straight to the larynx. It goes right down into the chest and then loops around an artery in the chest and then comes straight back up again to the larynx. And I've assisted in the dissection of a giraffe's neck, which happened to have died in a zoo. And we watched the, we saw the recurrent laryngeal nerve going, whizzing straight past the larynx within an inch of the larynx, down into the chest and then back up again, which is a detour of many feet. Very, very inefficient. The reason is historical. The ancestors are fish ancestors, the ancestors of all mammals and fish. The most direct pathway of that, of the equivalent of that nerve, there wasn't a larynx in those days, but it innovated part of the gills. The most direct pathway was behind that artery. And then when the mammal, when the tetrapods, when the land vertebra started evolving and then the neck started to stretch, the marginal cost of changing the embryological design to jump that nerve over the artery was too great, or rather was, each step of the way was a very small cost, but the marginal, but the cost of actually jumping it over would have been very large. As the neck lengthened, it was a negligible change to just increase the length of the detour, a tiny bit, a tiny bit, a tiny bit, each millimeter at a time didn't make any difference. And so, but finally, when you get to a giraffe, it's a huge detour and no doubt is very inefficient. Now that's bad design. Any engineer would reject that piece of design, it's ridiculous. And there are quite a number of examples, as you'd expect. It's not surprising that we find examples of that sort. In a way, what's surprising is there aren't more of them. In a way, what's surprising is that the design of living things is so good. So natural selection manages to achieve excellent results, partly by tinkering, partly by coming along and cleaning up initial mistakes, and as it were, making the best of a bad job. That's really interesting. I mean, it is surprising and beautiful. And it's a mystery from an engineering perspective that so many things are well designed. I suppose the thing we're forgetting is how many generations have to die for that. That's the inefficiency of it. Yes, that's the horrible wastefulness of it. So yeah, we marvel at the final product, but yeah, the process is painful. Elon Musk describes human beings as potentially the, what he calls the biological bootloader for artificial intelligence, or artificial general intelligence is used as the term. It's kind of like super intelligence. Do you see superhuman level intelligence as potentially the next step in the evolutionary process? Yes, I think that if superhuman intelligence is to be found, it will be artificial. I don't have any hope that we ourselves, our brains, will go on getting larger in ordinary biological evolution. I think that's probably come to an end. It is the dominant trend, or one of the dominant trends in our fossil history for the last two or three million years. Brain size? Brain size, yes. So it's been swelling rather dramatically over the last two or three million years. That is unlikely to continue. The only way that happens is because natural selection favors those individuals with the biggest brains, and that's not happening anymore. Right, so in general in humans, the selection pressures are not, I mean, are they active in any form? Well, in order for them to be active, it would be necessary that the most, let's call it an intelligence. Not that intelligence is simply correlated with brain size, but let's talk about intelligence. In order for that to evolve, it's necessary that the most intelligent beings have the most, individuals have the most children. And so intelligence may buy you money, it may buy you worldly success, it may buy you a nice house and a nice car and things like that if you have a successful career, it may buy you the admiration of your fellow people, but it doesn't increase the number of offspring that you have, it doesn't increase your genetic legacy to the next generation. On the other hand, artificial intelligence, I mean, computers and technology generally is evolving by a non-genetic means by leaps and bounds, of course. And so what do you think, I don't know if you're familiar, there's a company called Neuralink, but there's a general effort of brain computer interfaces, which is to try to build a connection between the computer and the brain to send signals both directions. And the long-term dream there is to do exactly that, which is expand, I guess expand the size of the brain, expand the capabilities of the brain. Do you see this as interesting? And do you see this as a promising possible technology or is the interface between the computer and the brain, like the brain is this wet messy thing that's just impossible to interface with? Well, of course it's interesting, whether it's promising, I'm really not qualified to say. What I do find puzzling is that the brain being as small as it is compared to a computer and the individual components being as slow as they are compared to our electronic components, it is astonishing what it can do. I mean, imagine building a computer that fits into the size of a human skull and with the equivalent of transistors or integrated circuits, which work as slowly as neurons do. It's something mysterious about that. Something must be going on that we don't understand. So I've just talked to Roger Penrose, I'm not sure if you're familiar with his work. He also describes this kind of mystery in the mind, in the brain that as he sees a materialist, so there's no sort of mystical thing going on, but there's so much about the material of the brain that we don't understand, that might be quantum mechanical in nature and so on. So there the idea is about consciousness. Do you have any, have you ever thought about, do you ever think about ideas of consciousness or a little bit more about the mystery of intelligence and consciousness that seems to pop up just like you're saying from our brain? I agree with Roger Penrose that there is a mystery there. I mean, he's one of the world's greatest physicists, so I can't possibly argue with his. But nobody knows anything about consciousness. And in fact, if we talk about religion and so on, the mystery of consciousness is so awe-inspiring and we know so little about it that the leap to sort of religious or mystical explanations is too easy to make. I think that it's just an act of cowardice to leap to religious explanations. Roger doesn't do that, of course. But I accept that there may be something that we don't understand about it. So correct me if I'm wrong, but in your book Selfish Gene, the gene-centered view of evolution allows us to think of the physical organisms as just the medium through which the software of our genetics and the ideas sort of propagate. So maybe can we start just with the basics? What in this context does the word meme mean? It would mean the cultural equivalent of a gene, cultural equivalent in the sense of that which plays the same role as the gene in the transmission of culture and the transmission of ideas in the broadest sense. And it's only a useful word if there's something Darwinian going on. Obviously culture is transmitted, but is there anything Darwinian going on? And if there is, that means there has to be something like a gene which becomes more numerous or less numerous in the population. So it can replicate? It can replicate. Well, it clearly does replicate. There's no question about that. The question is, does it replicate in a sort of differential way in a Darwinian fashion? Could you say that certain ideas propagate because they're successful in the meme pool? In a sort of trivial sense, you can. Would you wish to say though that in the same way as a animal body is modified, adapted to serve as a machine for propagating genes, is it also a machine for propagating memes? Could you actually say that something about the way a human is, is modified, adapted for the function of being propagation? That's such a fascinating possibility if that's true. If it's not just about the genes which seems somehow more comprehensible, it's like these things of biology. The idea that culture or maybe ideas, you can really broadly define it, operates under these mechanisms. Even morphology, even anatomy, does evolve by memetic means. I mean, things like hairstyles, styles of makeup, circumcision, these things are actual changes in the body form which are non-genetic and which get passed on from generation to generation or sideways like a virus in a quasi genetic way. But the moment you start drifting away from the physical, it becomes interesting because the space of ideas, ideologies, political systems. Of course, yes. What's your sense? Are memes a metaphor more or are they really, is there something fundamental, almost physical presence of memes? Well, I think they're a bit more than a metaphor and I think that, and I mentioned the physical bodily characteristics which are a bit trivial in a way, but when things like the propagation of religious ideas, both longitudinally down generations and transversely as in a sort of epidemiology of ideas, when a charismatic preacher converts people, that resembles viral transmission. Whereas the longitudinal transmission from grandparent to parent to child, et cetera, is more like conventional genetic transmission. That's such a beautiful, especially in the modern day idea. Do you think about this implication in social networks where the propagation of ideas, the viral propagation of ideas, enhance the new use of the word meme to describe? The internet, of course, provides extremely valuable and only rapid method of transmission. Before, when I first coined the word, the internet didn't exist. And so I was thinking then in terms of books, newspapers, broad radio, television, that kind of thing. Now an idea can just leap around the world in all directions instantly. And so the internet provides a step change in the facility of propagation of memes. How does that make you feel? Isn't it fascinating that sort of ideas, it's like you have Galapagos Islands or something, it's the 70s, and the internet allowed all these species to just like globalize. And in a matter of seconds, you can spread a message to millions of people. And these ideas, these memes can breed, can evolve, can mutate, and there's a selection, and there's like different, I guess, groups that evolve, like there's a dynamics that's fascinating here. Do you think, basically, do you think your work in this direction, while fundamentally was focused on life on earth, do you think it should continue? Like to be taken further? I mean, I do think it would probably be a good idea to think in a Darwinian way about this sort of thing. We can mention you think of the transmission of ideas in evolutionary context as being limited to, in our ancestors, people living in villages, living in small bands where everybody knew each other and ideas could propagate within the village, and they might hop to a neighboring village occasionally, and maybe even to a neighboring continent eventually. And that was a slow process. Nowadays, villages are international. I mean, you have people, it's been called echo chambers, where people are in a sort of internet village, where the other members of the village may be geographically distributed all over the world, but they just happen to be interested in the same things, use the same terminology, the same jargon, have the same enthusiasm. So people like the Flat Earth Society, they don't all live in one place, they find each other, and they talk the same language to each other, they talk the same nonsense to each other. And so this is a kind of distributed version of the primitive idea of people living in villages and propagating their ideas in a local way. Is there Darwinist parallel here? So is there evolutionary purpose of villages, or is that just a... I wouldn't use the word evolutionary purpose in that case, but villages will be something that just emerged, that's the way people happen to live. And in just the same kind of way, the Flat Earth Society, societies of ideas emerge in the same kind of way in this digital space. Is there something interesting to say about the... I guess from a perspective of Darwin, could we fully interpret the dynamics of social interaction in these social networks? Or is there some much more complicated thing need to be developed? Like, what's your sense? Well, a Darwinian selection idea would involve investigating which ideas spread and which don't. So in some ideas, don't have the ability to spread. I mean, the Flat Earthism, there are a few people believe in it, but it's not gonna spread because it's obvious nonsense. But other ideas, even if they are wrong, can spread because they are attractive in some sense. So the spreading and the selection in the Darwinian context is, it just has to be attractive in some sense. Like we don't have to define, like it doesn't have to be attractive in the way that animals attract each other. It could be attractive in some other way. Yes, all that matters is all that is needed is that it should spread. And it doesn't have to be true to spread. In truth is one criterion which might help an idea to spread. But there are other criteria which might help it to spread. As you say, attraction in animals is not necessarily valuable for survival. The famous peacock's tail doesn't help the peacock to survive, it helps it to pass on its genes. Similarly, an idea which is actually rubbish, but which people don't know is rubbish and think is very attractive will spread. In the same way as a peacock's genes spread. As a small sidestep, I remember reading somewhere, I think recently that in some species of birds, sort of the idea that beauty may have its own purpose and the idea that some birds, I'm being in eloquent here, but there is some aspects of their feathers and so on that serve no evolutionary purpose whatsoever. There's somebody making an argument that there are some things about beauty that animals do that may be its own purpose. Does that ring a bell for you? Is it sound ridiculous? I think it's a rather distorted bell. Darwin, when he coined the phrase sexual selection, didn't feel the need to suggest that what was attractive to females, usually is males attracting females, that what females found attractive had to be useful. He said it didn't have to be useful. It was enough that females found it attractive. And so it could be completely useless, probably was completely useless in the conventional sense, but was not at all useless in the sense of passing on, well, Darwin didn't call them genes, but in the sense of reproducing. Others, starting with Wallace, the co-discoverer of natural selection, didn't like that idea. And they wanted sexually selected characteristics like peacock's tails to be in some sense useful. It's a bit of a stretch to think of a peacock's tail as being useful, in the sense of survival, but others have run with that idea and have brought it up to date. And so there are two schools of thought on sexual selection, which are still active and about equally supported now. Those who follow Darwin in thinking that it's just enough to say it's attractive, and those who follow Wallace and say that it has to be in some sense useful. Do you fall into one category or the other? No, I'm open-minded. I think they both could be correct in different cases. Oh. I mean, they've both been made sophisticated in a mathematical sense, more so than when Darwin and Wallace first started talking about it. I'm Russian, I romanticize things, so I prefer the former. Yes. Where the beauty in itself is a powerful, so attraction is a powerful force in evolution. On religion, do you think there will ever be a time in our future where almost nobody believes in God, or God is not a part of the moral fabric of our society? Yes, I do. I think it may happen after a very long time. I think it may take a long time for that to happen. So do you think ultimately for everybody on Earth, religion, other forms of doctrines, ideas, could do a better job than what religion does? Yes. I mean, following truth. Well, truth is a funny word. And reason, too. There's, yeah, it's a difficult idea now with truth on the internet, right, and fake news and so on. I suppose when you say reason, you mean the very basic sort of inarguable conclusions of science versus which political system is better. Yes, yes. I mean truth about the real world, which is ascertainable by, not just by the more rigorous methods of science, but by just ordinary sensory observation. So do you think there will ever be a time when we move past it? Like, I guess another way to ask it, are we hopelessly, fundamentally tied to religion in the way our society functions? Well, clearly all individuals are not hopelessly tied to it because many individuals don't believe. You could mean something like society needs religion in order to function properly, something like that. And some people have suggested that. What's your intuition on that? Well, I've read books on it and they're persuasive. I don't think they're that persuasive, though. I mean, some people suggested that society needs a sort of figurehead, which can be a non-existent figurehead in order to function properly. I think there's something rather patronizing about the idea that, well, you and I are intelligent enough not to believe in God, but the plebs need it sort of thing. And I think that's patronizing. And I'd like to think that that was not the right way to proceed. But at the individual level, do you think there's some value of spirituality? Sort of, if I think sort of as a scientist, the amount of things we actually know about our universe is a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of what we could possibly know. So just from everything, even the certainty we have about the laws of physics, it seems to be that there's yet a huge amount to discover. And therefore, we're sitting where 99.999% of things are just still shrouded in mystery. Do you think there's a role in a kind of spiritual view of that, sort of a humbled spiritual view? I think it's right to be humble. I think it's right to admit that there's a lot we don't know, a lot that we don't understand, a lot that we still need to work on. We're working on it. What I don't think is that it helps to invoke supernatural explanations. What we, if our current scientific explanations aren't adequate to do the job, then we need better ones. We need to work more. And of course, the history of science shows just that, that as science goes on, problems get solved one after another, and the science advances, the science gets better. But to invoke a non-scientific, non-physical explanation is simply to lie down in a cowardly way and say, we can't solve it, so we're going to invoke magic. Don't let's do that. Let's say we need better science, we need more science. It may be that the science will never do it. It may be that we will never actually understand everything. And that's okay, but let's keep working on it. A challenging question there is, do you think science can lead us astray in terms of the humbleness? So there's some aspect of science, maybe it's the aspect of scientists and not science, but of sort of a mix of ego and confidence that can lead us astray in terms of discovering the, you know, some of the big open questions about the universe. I think that's right. I mean, there are arrogant people in any walk of life, and scientists are no exception to that. And so there are arrogant scientists who think we've solved everything. Of course, we haven't. So humility is a proper stance for a scientist. I mean, it's a proper working stance because it encourages further work. But in a way, to resort to a supernatural explanation is a kind of arrogance because it's saying, well, we don't understand it scientifically, therefore the non-scientific religious supernatural explanation must be the right one. That's arrogant. What is humble is to say, we don't know. And we need to work further on it. So maybe if I could psychoanalyze you for a second, you have at times been just slightly frustrated with people who have a supernatural. Has that changed over the years? Have you become, like, how do people that kind of have, seek supernatural explanations, how do you see those people as human beings? Do you see them as dishonest? Do you see them as sort of ignorant? Do you see them as, I don't know, like, how do you think of those? Certainly not dishonest. And I mean, obviously many of them are perfectly nice people, so I don't sort of despise them in that sense. I think it's often a misunderstanding that people will jump from the admission that we don't understand something. They will jump straight to what they think of as an alternative explanation, which is the supernatural one, which is not an alternative. It's a non-explanation. Instead of jumping to the conclusion that science needs more work, that we need to actually do some better science. So I don't have, I mean, personal antipathy towards such people. I just think they're misguided. So what about this really interesting space that I have trouble with? So religion, I have a better grasp on, but there's large communities, like you said, flat earth community that I've recently, because I've made a few jokes about it, I saw that there's, I've noticed that there's people that take it quite seriously. So there's this bigger world of conspiracy theorists, which is a kind of, I mean, there's elements of it that are religious as well, but I think they're also scientific. So the basic credo of a conspiracy theorist is to question everything, which is also the credo of a good scientist, I would say. So what do you make of this? I mean, I think it's probably too easy to say that by labeling something conspiracy, you therefore dismiss it. I mean, occasionally conspiracies are right. And so we shouldn't dismiss conspiracy theories out of hand, we should examine them on their own merits. Flat earth is obvious nonsense. We don't have to examine that much further. But I mean, there may be other conspiracy theories which are actually right. So I grew up in the Soviet Union, so the space race was very influential for me on both sides of the coin. There's a conspiracy theory, we never went to the moon, right? And it's like, I cannot understand it and it's very difficult to rigorously scientifically show one way or the other. It's just, you have to use some of the human intuition about who would have to lie, who would have to work together. And it's clear that very unlikely good, behind that is my general intuition that most people in this world are good. In order to really put together some conspiracy theories, there has to be a large number of people working together and essentially being dishonest. Yes, which is improbable. The sheer number who would have to be in on this conspiracy and the sheer detail, the attention to detail they'd have had to have had and so on. I'd also can worry about the motive and why would anyone want to suggest that it didn't happen? What's the, why is it so hard to believe? I mean, the physics of it, the mathematics of it, the idea of computing orbits and trajectories and things, it all works mathematically. Why wouldn't you believe it? It's a psychology question because there's something really pleasant about pointing out that the emperor has no clothes when everybody, like thinking outside the box and coming up with a true answer where everybody else is deluded. There's something, I mean, I have that for science, right? You wanna prove the entire scientific community wrong. That's the whole... No, that's right. And of course, historically, lone geniuses have come out right sometimes. But often people who think they're a lone genius have much more often turned out not to. So you have to judge each case on its merits. The mere fact that you're a maverick, the mere fact that you're going against the current tide doesn't make you right. You've got to show your right by looking at the evidence. So because you've focused so much on religion and disassembled a lot of ideas there and I was wondering if you have ideas about conspiracy theory groups, because it's such a prevalent, even reaching into presidential politics and so on, it seems like it's a very large communities that believe different kinds of conspiracy theorists. Is there some connection there to your thinking on religion? It is curious. It's a matter, it's an obviously difficult thing. I don't understand why people believe things that are clearly nonsense like, well, flat earth and also the conspiracy about not landing on the moon or that the United States engineered 9-11, that kind of thing. So it's not clearly nonsense, it's extremely unlikely. Okay, it's extremely unlikely. Religion is a bit different because it's passed down from generation to generation and so many of the people who are religious got it from their parents, who got it from their parents, who got it from their parents and childhood indoctrination is a very powerful force. But these things like the 9-11 conspiracy theory, the Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory, the man on the moon conspiracy theory, these are not childhood indoctrination. These are presumably dreamed up by somebody who then tells somebody else, who then wants to believe it. And I don't know why people are so eager to fall in line with just some person that they happen to read or meet who spins some yarn. I can kind of understand why they believe what their parents and teachers told them when they were very tiny and not capable of critical thinking for themselves. So I sort of get why the great religions of the world like Catholicism and Islam go on persisting. It's because of childhood indoctrination. But that's not true of flat earthism. And sure enough, flat earthism is a very minority cult. Way larger than I ever realized. Well, yes, I know. But so that's a really clean idea. You've articulated that in your new book and then the outgrown God and in God Delusion is the early indoctrination. That's really interesting. You can get away with a lot of out there ideas in terms of religious texts. If the age at which you convey those ideas at first is a young age. So indoctrination is sort of an essential element of propagation of religion. So let me ask on the morality side in the books that I mentioned, God Delusion and Outgrown God, you described that human beings don't need religion to be moral. So from an engineering perspective, we wanna engineer morality into AI systems. So in general, where do you think morals come from in humans? A very complicated and interesting question. It's clear to me that the moral standards, the moral values of our civilization changes as the decades go by, certainly as the centuries go by, even as the decades go by. And we in the 21st century are quite clearly labeled 21st century people in terms of our moral values. There's a spread. I mean, some of us are a little bit more ruthless, some of us more conservative, some of us more liberal and so on. But we all subscribe to pretty much the same views when you compare us with say 18th century, 17th century people, even 19th century, 20th century people. So we're much less racist, we're much less sexist and so on than we used to be. Some people are still racist and some are still sexist, but the spread has shifted. The Gaussian distribution has moved and moves steadily as the centuries go by. And that is the most powerful influence I can see on our moral values. And that doesn't have anything to do with religion. I mean, the morals of the Old Testament are Bronze Age models, they're deplorable and they are to be understood in terms of the people in the desert who made them up at the time. And so human sacrifice, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, petty revenge, killing people for breaking the Sabbath, all that kind of thing, inconceivable now. So at some point, religious texts may have in part reflected that Gaussian distribution at that time. I'm sure they did, I'm sure they always reflect that, yes. And then now, but the sort of, almost like the meme as you describe it of ideas moves much faster than religious texts do, than you religiously. Yeah, so basing your morals on religious texts which were written millennia ago is not a great way to proceed. I think that's pretty clear. So not only should we not get our morals from such texts, but we don't, we quite clearly don't. If we did, then we'd be discriminating against women and we'd be racist, we'd be killing homosexuals and so on. So we don't and we shouldn't. Now, of course it's possible to use your 21st century standards of morality and you can look at the Bible and you can cherry pick particular verses which conform to our modern morality. And you'll find that Jesus says some pretty nice things, which is great, but you're using your 21st century morality to decide which verses to pick, which verses to reject. And so why not cut out the middle man of the Bible and go straight to the 21st century morality, which is where that comes from. It's a much more complicated question. Why is it that morality, moral values change as the centuries go by? They undoubtedly do. And it's a very interesting question to ask why. It's another example of cultural evolution just as technology progresses. So moral values progress for probably very different reasons. But it's interesting if the direction in which that progress is happening has some evolutionary value or if it's merely a drift that can go into any direction. I'm not sure it's any direction and I'm not sure it's evolutionarily valuable. What it is is progressive in the sense that each step is a step in the same direction as the previous step. So it becomes more gentle, more decent by modern standards, more liberal, less violent. See, but more decent, I think you're using terms and interpreting everything in the context of the 21st century. Because Genghis Khan would probably say that this is not more decent because we're now, there's a lot of weak members of society. They were not murdering. Yes, and I was careful to say by the standards of the 21st century, by our standards, if we with hindsight look back at history, what we see is a trend in the direction towards us, towards our present, our present value system. For us, we see progress, but it's an open question whether that won't, you know, I don't see necessarily why we can never return to Genghis Khan times. Well, we could. I suspect we won't. But if you look at the history of moral values over the centuries, it is in a progressive, I use the word progressive not in a value judgment sense, in the sense of a transitive sense. Each step is the same direction as the previous step. So things like we don't derive entertainment from torturing cats. We don't derive entertainment from, like the Romans did in the Colosseum, from state. Or rather we suppress the desire to get, I mean, to have, it's probably in us somewhere. So there's a bunch of parts of our brain, one that probably, you know, limbic system that wants certain pleasures. And that's- I mean, I wouldn't have said that, but you're at liberty to think that. Well, there's a Dan Carlin of hardcore history that's a really nice explanation of how we've enjoyed watching the torture of people, the fighting of people, just the torture, the suffering of people throughout history as entertainment until quite recently. And now everything we do with sports, we're kind of channeling that feeling into something else. So, I mean, there is some dark aspects of human nature that are underneath everything. And I do hope this like higher level software we've built will keep us at bay. I'm also Jewish and have history with the Soviet Union and the Holocaust. And I clearly remember that some of the darker aspects of human nature creeped up there. They do, there have been steps backwards admittedly, and the Holocaust is obvious one. But if you take a broad view of history, it's the same direction. So, Pamela McCordick in Machines Who Think has written that AI began with an ancient wish to forge the gods. Do you see, it's a poetic description, I suppose, but do you see a connection between our civilization's historic desire to create gods, to create religions, and our modern desire to create technology and intelligent technology? I suppose there's a link between an ancient desire to explain away mystery and science, but artificial intelligence creating gods, creating new gods. I mean, I forget, I read somewhere a somewhat facetious paper which said that we have a new god, it's called Google, and we pray to it and we worship it and we ask its advice like an oracle and so on. That's fun. You see that as a fun statement, a facetious statement. You don't see that as a kind of truth of us creating things that are more powerful than ourselves and natural. It has a kind of poetic resonance to it, which I get. But I wouldn't. But not a scientific one. I wouldn't have bothered to make the point myself, put it that way. All right. So you don't think AI will become our new religion, a new gods, like Google? Well, yes, I mean, I can see that the future of intelligent machines or indeed intelligent aliens from outer space might yield beings that we would regard as gods in the sense that they are so superior to us that we might as well worship them. That's highly plausible, I think. But I see a very fundamental distinction between a god who is simply defined as something very, very powerful and intelligent on the one hand, and a god who doesn't need explaining by a progressive step-by-step process like evolution or like engineering design. Suppose we did meet an alien from outer space who was marvelously, magnificently more intelligent than us and we would sort of worship it for that reason. Nevertheless, it would not be a god in the very important sense that it did not just happen by to be there like God is supposed to. It must have come about by a gradual step-by-step, incremental progressive process, presumably like Darwinian evolution. There's all the difference in the world between those two. Intelligence, design, comes into the universe late as a product of a progressive evolutionary process or progressive engineering design process. So most of the work is done through this slow moving Exactly. Progress. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, but there's still this desire to get answers to the why question that if the world is a simulation, if we're living in a simulation, that there's a programmer like creature that we can ask questions of. Okay, well, let's pursue the idea that we're living in a simulation, which is not totally ridiculous, by the way. There we go. Then you still need to explain the programmer. The programmer had to come into existence by some, even if we're in a simulation, the programmer must have evolved. Or if he's in a sort of- Or she. Or she. If she's in a meta simulation, then the meta programmer must have evolved by a gradual process. You can't escape that. Fundamentally, you've got to come back to a gradual incremental process of explanation to start with. There's no shortcuts in this world. No, exactly. But maybe to linger on that point about the simulation, do you think it's an interesting, basically, talk to, board the heck out of everybody asking this question, but whether you live in a simulation. Do you think, first, do you think we live in a simulation? Second, do you think it's an interesting thought experiment? It's certainly an interesting thought experiment. I first met it in a science fiction novel by Daniel Galloy, called Counterfeit World, in which it's all about, I mean, our heroes are running a gigantic computer which simulates the world, and something goes wrong. And so one of them has to go down into the simulated world in order to fix it. And then the denouement of the thing, the climax to the novel is that they discover that they themselves are in another simulation at a higher level. So I was intrigued by this, and I love others of Daniel Galloy's science fiction novels. Then it was revived seriously by Nick Bostrom. Bostrom talking to him in an hour. Okay. And he goes further, not just treat it as a science fiction speculation, he actually thinks it's positively likely. I mean, he thinks it's very likely, actually. Well, he makes like a probabilistic argument which you can use to come up with very interesting conclusions about the nature of this universe. I mean, he thinks that we're in a simulation done by, so to speak, our descendants of the future, but it's still a product of evolution. It's still ultimately going to be a product of evolution, even though the super intelligent people of the future have created our world, and you and I are just a simulation, and this table is a simulation, and so on. I don't actually, in my heart of hearts, believe it, but I like his argument. Well, so the interesting thing is, I agree with you, but the interesting thing to me, if I were to say, if we're living in a simulation, that in that simulation, to make it work, you still have to do everything gradually, just like you said. That even though it's programmed, I don't think there can be miracles. Otherwise, it's- Well, no. I mean, the programmer, the upper ones, have to have evolved gradually. However, the simulation they create could be instantaneous. I mean, it could be switched on, and we come into the world with fabricated memories. True, but what I'm trying to convey, so you're saying the broader statement, but I'm saying from an engineering perspective, both the programmer has to be slowly evolved and the simulation, because it's- Oh, yeah. From an engineering perspective- Oh, yeah, it takes a long time to write a program. No, I don't think you can create the universe in a snap. I think you have to grow it. Okay, well, that's a good point. That's an arguable point. By the way, I have thought about using the Nick Bostrom idea to solve the riddle of how you were talking. We were talking earlier about why the human brain can achieve so much. I thought of this when my then 100-year-old mother was marveling at what I could do with a smartphone, and I could look up anything in the encyclopedia, I could play her music that she liked and so on. She said, but it's all in that tiny little phone. No, it's out there, it's in the cloud. And maybe most of what we do is in a cloud. So maybe if we are a simulation, then all the power that we think is in our skull, it actually may be like the power that we think is in the iPhone, but is that actually out there in an- Interface to something else. Yeah. Including Roger Penrose with panpsychism that consciousness is somehow a fundamental part of physics, that it doesn't have to actually all reside inside our brain. But Roger thinks it does reside in the skull, whereas I'm suggesting that it doesn't, that there's a cloud. That'd be a fascinating notion. On a small tangent, are you familiar with the work of Donald Hoffman, I guess? Maybe not saying his name correctly, but just forget the name, the idea that there's a difference between reality and perception. So like we biological organisms perceive the world in order for the natural selection process to be able to survive and so on. But that doesn't mean that our perception actually reflects the fundamental reality, the physical reality underneath. Well, I do think that, although it reflects the fundamental reality, I do believe there is a fundamental reality, I do think that our perception is constructive in the sense that we construct in our minds a model of what we're seeing. And so this is really the view of people who work on visual illusions like Richard Gregory, who point out the things like a Necker cube, which flip from a two dimensional picture of a cube on sheet of paper. But we see it as a three dimensional cube, and it flips from one orientation to another at regular intervals. What's going on is that the brain is constructing a cube, but the sense data are compatible with two alternative cubes. And so rather than stick with one of them, it alternates between them. I think that's just a model for what we do all the time. When we see a table, when we see a person, when we see anything, we're using the sense data to construct or make use of a perhaps previously constructed model. I noticed this when I meet somebody who actually is say a friend of mine, but until I kind of realized that it is him, he looks different. And then when I finally clock that it's him, his features switch like a Necker cube into the familiar form. As it were, I've taken his face out of the filing cabinet inside and grafted it onto, or used the sense data to invoke it. Yeah, we do some kind of miraculous compression on this whole thing to be able to filter out most of the sense data and makes sense of it. That's just a magical thing that we do. So you've written several, many amazing books, but let me ask what books, technical or fiction or philosophical had a big impact on your own life? What books would you recommend people consider reading in their own intellectual journey? Darwin, of course. And- The original, I've actually ashamed to say I've never read Darwin in the original. He's astonishingly prescient because considering he was writing in the middle of the 19th century, Michael Gieselin said he's working a hundred years ahead of his time. Everything except genetics is amazingly right and amazingly far ahead of his time. And of course you need to read the updatings that have happened since his time as well. And he would be astonished by, well, let alone Watson and Crick, of course, but he'd be astonished by Mendelian genetics as well. And- Yeah, it'd be fascinating to see what he thought about, he would think about DNA. I mean, yes, it would. Because in many ways it clears up what appeared in his time to be a riddle. The digital nature of genetics clears up what was a problem, what was a big problem. Gosh, there's so much that I could think of. I can't really- Is there something outside sort of more fiction? Is there, when you think young, was there books that just kind of, outside of kind of the realm of science, religion, that just kind of sparked your journey? Yes, well, actually I have, I suppose I could say that I've learned some science from science fiction. I mentioned Daniel Galloy, and that's one example, but another of his novels called Dark Universe, which is not terribly well known, but it's a very, very nice science fiction story. It's about a world of perpetual darkness. And we're not told at the beginning of the book why these people are in darkness. They stumble around in some kind of underground world of caverns and passages, using echolocation like bats and whales to get around. And they've adapted, presumably by Darwinian means, to survive in perpetual total darkness. But what's interesting is that their mythology, their religion has echoes of Christianity, but it's based on light. And so there's been a fall from a paradise world that once existed where light reigns supreme. And because of the sin of mankind, light banished them. So then they no longer are in light's presence, but light survives in the form of mythology and in the form of sayings like, they're great light almighty, oh, for light's sake, don't do that. And I hear what you mean rather than I see what you mean. So some of the same religious elements are present in this other totally kind of absurd different form. Yes. And so it's a wonderful, I wouldn't call it satire because it's too good nature for that. I mean, there were a wonderful parable about Christianity and the doctrine, the theological doctrine of the fall. So I find that kind of science fiction immensely stimulating. Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud, oh, by the way, anything by Arthur C. Clarke, I find very, very wonderful too. Fred Hoyle's The Black Cloud, his first science fiction novel where he, well, I learned a lot of science from that. It suffers from an obnoxious hero, unfortunately, but apart from that, you learn a lot of science from it. Another of his novels, the Aether Andromeda, which by the way, the theme of that is taken up by Carl Sagan's science fiction novel, another wonderful writer, Carl Sagan Contact, where the idea is, again, we will not be visited from outer space by physical bodies. We will be visited possibly, we might be visited by radio, but the radio signals could manipulate us and actually have a concrete influence on the world if they make us or persuade us to build a computer which runs their software, so that they can then transmit their software by radio, and then the computer takes over the world. And this is the same theme in both Hoyle's book and Sagan's book. I presume, I don't know whether Sagan knew about Hoyle's book, probably did. And it's a clever idea that we will never be invaded by physical bodies. The war of the worlds of H.G. Wells will never happen, but we could be invaded by radio signals, code, coded information, which is sort of like DNA. And we are, I call them, we are survival machines of our DNA, so it has great resonance for me, because I think of us, I think of bodies, physical bodies, biological bodies, as being manipulated by coded information, DNA, which has come down through generations. And in a space of memes, it doesn't have to be physical, it can be transmitted through the space of information. That's a fascinating possibility that from outer space, we can be infiltrated by other memes, by other ideas, and thereby controlled in that way. Let me ask the last, the silliest, or maybe the most important question. What is the meaning of life? What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness? From a scientific point of view, the meaning of life is the propagation of DNA, but that's not what I feel. That's not the meaning of my life. So the meaning of my life is something which is probably different from yours and different from other people's, but we each make our own meaning. So we set up goals we want to achieve, we want to write a book, we want to do whatever it is we do write a quartet, we want to win a football match. And these are short-term goals, well, maybe even quite long-term goals, which are set up by our brains, which have goal-seeking machinery built into them. But what we feel, we don't feel motivated by the desire to pass on our DNA mostly. We have other goals, which can be very moving, very important. They could even be called spiritual in some cases. We want to understand the riddle of the universe. We want to understand consciousness. We want to understand how the brain works. These are all noble goals. Some of them can be noble goals anyway. And they are a far cry from the fundamental biological goal, which is the propagation of DNA. But the machinery that enables us to set up these higher level goals is originally programmed into us by natural selection of DNA. The propagation of DNA, but what do you make of this unfortunate fact that we are mortal? Do you ponder your mortality? Does it make you sad? Does it? I ponder it. It makes me sad that I shall have to leave and not see what's going to happen next. If there's something frightening about mortality, apart from sort of missing, as I've said, something more deeply, darkly frightening, it's the idea of eternity. But eternity is only frightening if you're there. Eternity before we were born, billions of years before we were born, and we were effectively dead before we were born. As I think it was Mark Twain said, I was dead for billions of years before I was born and never suffered the smallest inconvenience. That's how it's going to be after we leave. So I think of it as really, eternity is a frightening prospect. And so the best way to spend it is under a general anesthetic, which is what it'll be. Beautifully put. Richard, it is a huge honor to meet you, to talk to you. Thank you so much for your time. Thank you very much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Richard Dawkins, and thank you to our presenting sponsor, Cash App. Please consider supporting the podcast by downloading Cash App and using code LexPodcast. If you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on YouTube, review with five stars on Apple Podcasts, support on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman. And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Richard Dawkins. We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place, but who will in fact never see the light of day, outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly, those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds, it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few who won the lottery of birth against all odds. How dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.","label":1}

It has moved and moved in second at the public here of Council Bill 760 is open. May we have the staff report process?\nSpeaker 13: Good evening, council members. Thanks for hanging in there. Thanks, everyone, for hanging in there. And congratulations on just 1\/2.\nSpeaker 3: Hey, as you're exiting, could you please could you please lower your voice just so we can get going on this council? Bill. Thank you.\nSpeaker 13: So again, congratulations. And I am a barge with the Department of Community Planning and Development here to bring the 38th and Blake Station area height amendments to you for final consideration. These are amendments to five plans that overlap in the 38th and Blake Station area. It's a bit unusual to specifically amend plans in this way. There there is a reason we know, of course, and just previously discussed the level of change going on throughout the city of Denver. But this area, of course, is just right at the vanguard of that change. It's changing so rapidly and there's so much development opportunity. And and there also is a lot of public investment that has already gone into this area and that will go into this area. And that presents an opportunity more technically. These five overlapping plans have obscured the vision, I would say, for heights in this, the most critical area right around the station. And and we seek to improve and clarify that. And then throughout the process of looking at the height amendments, some things came up that we'll also discuss in terms of the need for new tools to promote higher design quality in the area. And you're you haven't escaped yet. Affordable housing is also part of this discussion. So I mentioned the public improvements here. You're all aware of the Brighton Boulevard streetscape improvements that are are just starting really significant improvements there. The Planned River, North Park, the new commuter rail station at 38th. And Blake, together, they represent essentially hundreds of millions of dollars worth of public improvements in the area where this plant amendment will occur. And I think that that relates to a concept that I want to discuss a little bit regarding value capture. And that is the idea that with all of this investment, that the community that the public is putting into this area, along with the idea that actually it might be more appropriate for there to be even more intense level of private development near the station than was anticipated in the previous plans. But that provides an opportunity to capture some of the value that all of this creates for the community, specifically in the form of higher quality design and the integration of affordable housing into the station area. And that's what we heard really specifically from the community throughout this process, that high density tower development. Yes, it's appropriate. It's it has to provide benefits. This sets a little bit of a of a new precedent, this idea for specifically capturing value in an area like this. But I think it's something and I and I know Brad Buchannan, the director of Community Planning and development, feels this way, too, that this is an important precedent to set and this is an important or a very appropriate place to do it. The 38th and Blake area to look at how all of this investment, all of this development potential can really specifically produce benefits for the community beyond just the development itself. So and then just looking at that, the technical reasons for amending the plan, those five overlapping plans start with the 2003 River North Area Plan. There was a stationary plan in 2009, the Northeast Downtown Neighborhoods Plan in 2011, and then the 2014 Globeville plan and most recently the 2015 Elyria and Swansea. A neighborhood plan all make recommendations that overlap at least some part of the area that we're talking about tonight. A lot of them agree, or at least are clear, that the newer plan sets precedent over the older plan. But you have to look at all of these different plans to figure out what's going on. And it tells a story that's that's a little hard to read. Also the most recent plan earlier in Swansea, a neighborhood plan, you know, in some cases it says things like taller building heights may be appropriate in certain locations or that provide community benefits but doesn't say what those locations are or what the benefits are. We're we're fixing that with these plan amendments. So before I I'll run through the the four major recommendations of the plan. The process began early this year. Tim Watkins, with Community Planning and Development, was the project manager throughout most of the process. As many of you know by now, he's moved on to a job in Utah, which is where he's lived for years. So that's the whole it was a long time coming. And so Tim is no longer with the department, but he he really ran a very inclusive public process for this amendment effort that included four major public workshops. Thanks to the folks at XDA for hosting those we had, you know, I think more than a couple hundred people at that, at least one of them. So they were very well attended. This hearing tonight, the final adoption hearing concludes the the adoption process. But we actually are ready to move into implementation right away. Essentially, this is these are very targeted amendments. And we're looking at doing the implementation for the higher building design quality that I'll talk more about and the integration of affordable housing, essentially starting tomorrow, if you give us the green light. So the the recommendation of the plan amendments, the first and kind of most overarching recommendation is to promote taller building heights that some that support transit oriented development or TOD in the station area. And that means what we heard as part of the the community process develop these amendments that taller heights are appropriate particularly near the station platform than were recommended in the previously adopted plan. So just to be clear, the this these amendments do recommend taller heights. But those taller heights would have to come with transitions to surrounding neighborhoods. Cole and Curtis Park have the most exposure, but also Globeville and Elyria. Swansea, and that those taller heights have to come along with the provision of community benefits. So this is an important map in the plan amendments. It's on page seven of the of the plan amendments in your packets. It's a little bit more complex than the typical heat map in a plan because it's showing two different things. The colors, the red, for instance, that's around the station area marked by a T there shows the maximum incentive height, showing that as 16 stories near the station platform. But we're also showing those those white numbers and the white lines are showing what the maximum base heights are. And what that is, is are the heights that are recommended by all those overlapping, existing adopted plans. Typically, when we had a new plan, we'd be setting those aside and moving on. In this case, there's there's a couple of specific reasons to keep those heights on the book and on the books. We're calling them Base Heights. Number one is just to clarify where we're starting from when we say that the development that takes advantage of the heights that are enabled by this plan amendments provides community benefits. So it's the development clearly that's above those heights that are in white. Number two is more technically that we're we're able to clarify the status of map amendments that will be coming through the system. So at least two MAP amendments in this area will come to you before we're able to create the tools that would require the higher design quality and the integrated affordable housing. But what we're saying is that. Map amendments that seek only the heights that were recommended in the previous plans that don't seek to take advantage of these new, taller heights can be appropriate in the interim. But the plan amendments are very direct in saying that map amendments that seek the taller building heights, for example, 16 storeys at the platform would not be appropriate until the tools have actually been developed to compel the community benefits to to require integrated, affordable housing and higher design quality. So that first recommendation to promote Taller Building Heights comes along with the need to promote height transitions. Here we're looking from a point in the whole neighborhood. If you look at this viewpoint right now, you wouldn't see much down there at the end of the street if that area around the platform were built out. According to the currently adopted plans, it might look something like this off in the distance. The plan amendments would allow for taller building heights over there. So you might see something like this, but those taller building heights would come along with the specific community benefits. Recommendation number two really just gets more specific about the need to adopt a regulatory approach to ensure greater design quality throughout the station area. Talks about what greater design quality means a little bit more specifically or what it would seek to achieve in terms of active and walkable public realm, minimizing parking visibility and how and how we intend to more specifically accomplish that or regulate the higher design quality. So just visually looking at what higher design quality might mean, it might mean that there's mass reduction in buildings, that these bigger buildings have to be broken down into smaller parts or can't just be big boxes, that there's greater activation at the pedestrian level, like taller ground floor heights or more specific requirements about ground floor uses. These images on the upper right, you'll see screened parking is one of the things that is in the category of higher design quality specific requirements about the design of any structured parking that's visible from the street. And then I mentioned mass reduction kind of on the left center slide there, meaning that, yes, the plan amendments are saying that taller buildings are appropriate, but that doesn't just mean a 16 storey box say that there's going to be a tool applied to compel something to be happening with that box, whether it's upper story setbacks or or other mechanisms that break down the mass and scale of the building. Recommendation number three is to establish the river corridor as an amenity and a resource. This was something that most people that we talked to in the planning process really felt strongly about, that we needed to be very clear on how the river should be treated. And what that means specifically is that it should be treated as if it were a primary street in terms of what level of transparency would be required, and that all of these tools that will require higher design quality should should be applied to the frontages facing the river as well. The final recommendation regards the integration of affordable housing into the station area. And talks about the increased heights as an incentive for affordable housing built within walking distance of the station. And that this needs to be coordinated with citywide, affordable housing programs. We now have a new citywide affordable housing program. As of moments ago, the intent is that we develop a tool subsequent to the adoption of these plan amendments that works with the new citywide regulations to promote affordable housing that's actually provided specifically within this area. And will will go through a separate process to actually develop those tools. So there's still some unknowns with it. But the basic objectives are it it promotes housing that's there by the station and that it works with this system that you just adopted. So we're not using different metrics. We're requiring the same kind of housing. The final part of the plan, amendments on beginning on the last page, just get a little bit more specific about the next steps. The really important one being this are regulatory and policy strategies saying that, yes, you know, we are directed with adoption of these plan amendments to move forward with tools such as a design overlay district to implement regulations or recommendations for greater design quality and for integration of affordable and mixed income housing near the station area. And I'll just mention, and I think a couple of members of our steering committee may speak about this when I'm finished as well. But the River North R.A. has been working for some time on a request for a design overlay district for River North that really addresses many of the ideas that came out as part of the 30th and Blake Station area process. And what we're looking at doing is taking that design overlay request and using that as the foundation for for what greater design quality means at 30th and Blake and then throughout the rest of of river north as well. The moving forward recommendations also just emphasize that some of the more general recommendations in those previous plans really need to be emphasized specifically in terms of public investment strategies and the need to continue partnerships. Those are more broad recommendations that we continue to work on those things as opposed to the really that specific first recommendation that we move forward right away with the implementation of the regulatory tools. And just to know the way that will accomplish or that we plan to accomplish the plan amendments is to have them as a standalone document, as you saw in your package. But then to on the covers of all of the affected plans to note that that part of the plan has been amendment amended and that you should review the other the newly adopted document. So I'll just go there's a lot more detail about this in your staff report, so I won't spend much time here, but just running through the criteria for adoption of a plan or plan amendments in this case, the first being plan consistency and staff finds that the proposed plan amendments are consistent with the Denver Comprehensive Plan and the relevant plan amendments that are listed on this slide, which include the five plans that will be updated. That an inclusive public process was used to create the plan amendments. As I mentioned previously, there were four big public workshops as part of the process. This was all assisted by a great steering committee, which included representatives of all of the affected RINO's. They met very regularly throughout the process. Tim Watkins actually went to a lot of neighborhood meetings and gave presentations and answered questions throughout the process. And we had the usual electronic outreach, including a website. The final criteria is that the plan or plan amendments take a long term view, and we find that the 30th and Blake stationary amendments establish a vision framework that will guide change in the neighborhood for the next 20 years and that that's an appropriate long term perspective. So our staff recommendation, based on the findings of the plan amendment, is consistent with the Denver comprehensive plan and applicable supplements. Then an inclusive public process was utilized and that the plan includes a long term view is that City Council adopt the plan amendments as a supplement to the Denver Comprehensive Plan. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Well done, Abe filling in for our friend. We're going to call up our eight speakers tonight. That's okay. And I'm sure there will be plenty of questions. Maybe not at this hour, but so stand by, Joe Noble. First up, Cindy. Cindy Candy CdeBaca. Do not see her. Mike Duggan. Do not see him. Jamie Lynn Co. Jamie's back there and then bring up. Oh, no, no. Miguel is not here. John, he. Come on up. You each have 3 minutes. Go ahead, John.\nSpeaker 10: Good evening, counsel. My name is Joel Noble. I serve on the board of directors of Curtis Park Neighbors. The position for Curtis Park neighbors will be given later by John Hayden. Curtis Park Neighbors President. I served on the steering committee for this effort representing Curtis Park neighbors and wanted to give a few reflections on the process. The first is this is very rare that we amend plans enter neighborhood cooperation a couple of years ago adopted a zoning and planning position statement. That platform that among many other things said it should be possible to amend plans. Plans take a long term perspective and last 20 years. But sometimes things change in the public's view for what should happen. And it's going to take a long time if the public's view has shifted to see that reflected in a new plan. Well, how do we know that the public's view has shifted? It's not a problem that we have many different plans overlapping in this area. The issue is that the plans show an evolution in thinking. So if you were to go back in the slide deck, you would see that the very latest plans, the clearest wants a plan that comes down to 38th Street envisions up to 12 stories on that side of the street, whereas the plan right across 38th Street and again, this is an a mixed use area. I envision much lower heights, only five stories maximum. And you have to look at the at the total result of all these overlapping plans and say this was not thought through because they were done piecemeal and they were done piecemeal with disjoint map segments. And that points to the vision of the community evolving over time, but not being fully captured. And so we were able to take the public's call for the ability to have a plan, amendments with a clear, crying out for map amendments and do that here. The process was wonderful. I think they captured it at a high level. But because plan amendments are rare, we have visitors from other neighborhoods not in the area coming to see what was going on. Is, is someone getting away with something here? Is the public really being represented? And I think when they saw that lots of community members, residential neighbors were represented as well as the business owners and property owners, they were satisfied that this process was proceeding as it should and we stopped seeing them at the meetings. But it was good that we watched their processes are working right. I don't have a lot of time left, so I just wanted to finally touch on the visualizations, the the SketchUp visualizations that you saw. If you look this direction, if things were built to the maximum the current plans had, here's what your view would be. And in this new plan, here's what it would be were crucial to assuring neighborhoods. What are you buying into? What does it look like in the distance? Especially the whole neighborhood, which is the closest residential neighborhood to the platform? You'll see in your packet letters of support from all the residential neighborhoods nearby. And I hope you lend us your support.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Noble. Excuse me. Did you see Kennedy, see tobacco or no. Okay. Okay. We'll go straight to Jamie. Let's go.\nSpeaker 6: Good evening, counsel. Thanks for the opportunity to comment. My name is Jamie Lygo. I serve as the executive director for the Rhino Art District, the Rhino Business Improvement District, the Rhino General Improvement District. I'll keep my comments brief tonight, but I just want to say, first of all, thanks to Councilman Brooks, thanks to CPD, who did a tremendous job, thanks to all the neighborhood participants that were involved in this process. It was an incredibly strong show of kind of community input and support for what we went through. You all know by now that Rhino is a place that likes to do things completely differently. They like to challenge convention, and I love that. It's a neighborhood that set the standard for trying to challenge the conversation and push. We are at the epicenter of urban growth in the neighborhood and we are a developing neighborhood. So we have the opportunity to do that. So I just want to say a couple of things about this that I saw from the process that the neighborhood really supports, just so you know. First of all, obviously, the affordable housing component is really important, but also the opportunity to use density, the density conversation as a way to push a conversation about what our neighborhoods should look like for people, for bicyclists from the public realm perspective, and how we can encourage transit oriented development in a way that also supports building neighborhoods that will stand the test of time as they develop out. And I believe this process has really addressed that in a really beautiful way. And the outcome we've gotten to is supported and celebrated by the neighborhood. And you can't ask for much more than that. So thank you very much.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Okay. Let's see who's here. John Hayden? Yes.\nSpeaker 8: Good evening. Members of Council. I am here as the president of Curtis Park Neighbors and I wanted to let you know that our board voted in favor of this amendment. In addition, we had a presentation at our general meeting done by CPD that was remarkable in that at the end of the meeting, almost all 50 people in the in the neighbor that came to the meeting were like, Yeah, let's do it. So I was pretty excited that we have something that, that our community is fully behind here and we are coming to you saying, yes, please bring density here, bring affordable housing to our community. We want to see that happen. And so we support this.\nSpeaker 3: Thanks. Thank you. Can you say that again? I'm just joking. Let me get Andy Feinstein and Justin Grove.\nSpeaker 14: Good evening, counsel, and thank you for giving us the opportunity to speak this evening. I just want to augment a lot of the comments. Everybody else said, you know, we just we just witnessed a very robust debate and discussion on affordable housing. And as Jamie took one step back, sorry, I am the cochairman of the right now our district. I'm a resident business owner and property owner in the district. And I've been there for over seven years. So very invested in neighborhood. We just witnessed a terrific conversation on affordable housing. And as Jamie mentioned, we in Reno really pride ourselves on doing things different. And we believe that this opportunity to, you know, move on from the intent of all these plans going back to 2003, which was to have as much density as possible around the station. Unfortunately, when these plans were created in 2003, 2009, 2011, as Abe showed you, even then, the intent was to maximize density on the station. When they were created, no one foresaw 3000 people a month moving to Denver, the 4500 people a month moving to the metro area. So we believe and I know that to combat these challenges that we have, like affordability, like ground floor activation, we got to build up and we want to do this. You know, we want to do this at our station. And we've worked very collaboratively, very robustly with the public conversation to to get to this point. And thanks to Councilman Brooks, his leadership speed has been unbelievable. And our steering committee, I think we're there. So we welcome your support. We're excited about this opportunity. And hopefully Reinoehl can serve as a template for the whole city of how to incentivize affordability for other people to move down that path as well. So thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Feinstein. Justin Kroft Last but not least.\nSpeaker 13: Thank you, President Brooks. I want to also echoed the sentiment that this was a pretty amazing process with multiple neighborhoods involved and I think great leadership from city staff, from Councilman Brooks and from the steering committee. My name is Justin Croft. I'm a resident of coal. I work in Reno and I was on the steering committee. I am the chairman of the Reno bid. I think what's so interesting about this process is this very easily could have been more of a technical exercise to align planning documents. It also could have accidentally been a way to just entitle a bunch of ground without anything tied to it. Instead, the community really prioritized this idea that we want to get the best parts of density and not the worst parts of density. And that takes a little bit of thinking around the policy that would be attached to adding extra density around the station. Some of the ideas that we talked about with getting the best parts of density were making sure that the district is walkable, that the population that is moving in is really supporting local goods and services. The idea is that they're buying art. They're buying beer from our breweries. They're supporting retail. They're supporting office. They're supporting services in the district, increase civic engagement, diversity of incomes and cultural exchange really happening on the street. These are markers of a vital urban neighborhood. Some things that can happen if you don't plan correctly, are more of a drive in, drive out situation. Vertical suburbanization, I like to call it. So the idea that you have these buildings around the transit center that people really are treating similarly to if they lived in a multifamily building or even a single family building out in the suburbs, I'm not getting some of those benefits there by clogging streets. People are driving to every single kind of goods service job that they need. What is the benefit of really having that kind of density around a transit station in the first place? And if we're ending up with a more homogeneous population and not a more diverse population, it seems like we've failed in that regard to the ideas that since we always talk about building more density around transit to take advantage of it, if instead we're adding more cars to the street, we've probably failed in that. We talk about really wanting to increase affordability around transit citywide, and if in fact we're creating a more homogeneous situation, we've probably failed at that. So the idea behind this plan is really tying it to these two factors design with the idea being that you activate the street, you create commercial spaces on the ground floor that thereby reduce the need for everyone to have to drive to every good and service job that they need to attend. And then also requiring affordability, but making it a density bonus in effect, so that as a developer it's working better for you, or at least as well economically, while providing a great situation for some of the lower income folks that are at such a critical piece to a diverse neighborhood. So in closing, I just want to say thank you for the time, and I ask that you please support this.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Mr. Kraft. All right. This concludes our speakers questions by members of council. It comes from an article.\nSpeaker 9: So I am thinking, Mr. President, I'm. Trying to understand the direct interface with the other stationary of plans. So such as, you know, 41st and Fox. I mean, they're they're on the maps in these documents. And it's not clear if this particular bill tonight is having the effect of ultimately increasing the density in those areas without those having to come back here. Yeah. Can somebody just.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman? I can do that. And even if I miss a beat, let me know. So these are just the neighborhood plans. This is the 30th in Blake's stationary plan. This is northeast downtown area plans, this Globeville or Swansea neighborhood plans. And we're amending those. So this has nothing to do with 41st and Fox and.\nSpeaker 9: Colorado and 40. So we're amending the neighborhood plans that address the issue of density as it. Affects the proximity to transit because that's primarily where we're going to be seeing the increase in density, right?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. But I just I just wanted to be clear that we weren't amending the other station area plans, as you stated in your first question. And and I don't know if you heard Abe at the beginning, a lot of these oh, it was Jill Noble. A lot of these plans were conflicting with one another because they were started a very different times in the earlier global or Swansea. A plan in particular had, as Joel was saying, 12 on on one side of the street in a different. So what we were trying to do is say how can we bring some congruency to all of these plans together and in the process raise the question, are we at the right heights around this station area? Have we taking full advantage of this infrastructure?\nSpeaker 9: So let me just clarify that with an additional question. So it's because those neighborhood plans all in some way touch on the 38th and Blake that we're having to amend and update those neighborhood plans.\nSpeaker 3: Yes.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman Black.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. Quick question, Abe. It's just about the design guidelines. Is is that something that is required? Only to get the extra height or is it required for all the zoning in that?\nSpeaker 13: That's a that's a very good question. One thing that we heard when talking about the design quality was that it really was something that the community's looking for in the area, regardless of what happens with the height increases. And so there's a little bit of a distinction to be made with the integrated affordable housing where we're saying that's really about the the new increment of height that would be enabled and ensuring that when you're taking advantage of that, you're providing onsite affordable housing. The design quality is intended to apply to all projects in the area. However, it's quite likely that some of the specific design requirements would only apply to two bigger projects. For example, the tallest buildings might have the most meaningful mass reduction requirements and that kind of thing.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you. I think that's great. But the other question is, are they just guidelines as far as shapes and how dense they are and how whatever to step back or is it? Is there like a committee that reviews the architecture?\nSpeaker 13: No committee except that Reno kind of wants to have its own ad hoc committee. But really what we're talking about here to implement this plan will be effectively zoning requirements implemented through a design overlay, which is a tool enabled by the zoning code to apply specific standards to to a certain area. So there'll be there'll be quantitative rules.\nSpeaker 6: Yeah. Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Mass reduction and things like that. Just to carry on. Don't. Councilman.\nSpeaker 10: You know, I was looking at the affordable housing about the regulatory approach. What are you are you talking about something different than the affordable housing now, or are you talking about something like inclusionary housing be apply there or or something like inclusionary housing applying to apartments for the first time? What are what are we talking about?\nSpeaker 3: EB I'm going to actually take this one.\nSpeaker 13: Because I think you're, you're the best person.\nSpeaker 3: This is one of the more complex ones. But now that we are passed this bill, we feel it gives us a little leeway to start to put this regulatory framework together. We did not want our regulatory framework for affordable housing to conflict with this bill. And so you will see both rental units and for sale units covered under this. And the way the way you do it is you incentivize if someone wants to go up to that, well, that's 616 stories. They will be able to do that for a percentage of affordable units.\nSpeaker 10: So be done with incentives and not penalties like the idea.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, well if. Yes.\nSpeaker 10: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 8: I first have to apologize. She's not here. But Susan Sue Powers, because I didn't raise my hand when I was asked if I had any affordable housing groundbreaking. I couldn't remember. But I did get eight units, despite the total loss of affordability that we've had in northwest Denver. But to this I mean, this is this is a great tool. I really have a this question might be two. Like I would like to hear from maybe three of you that were participants. You know, you guys were both the beneficiaries of having plans that overlapped and needing this sort of discussion to sort of rewrite and revisit these these plans. But is there anything in areas? So I'll just be frank. You know, we got the station area up at 41st and Fox Lake Councilwoman Ortega mentioned where we do have a stationary plan, but we don't you know, our plans are go back 30 years. And with with some vision about when we get around to it in the future. But is there anything in your process that you think that, you know, could could those be could these ideas and these steps be captured without having the plans in place, you know, because the outcome is valuable, invalid. And we do have some direction in our stationary plan. And it's important where where you're going with with this forum design guidelines and standards and the incentives for affordability that we capture that in in that area as well. If you've been paying attention and hopefully you haven't, we've had other discussions about Globeville and Forty-firsts and Fox and sort of the LAC, I mean, the constant rezoning, but the lack of tools to actually implement the vision of the Globeville plan. So having been through it all, you know, can we go from 0 to 2 this without having those incremental plans in place? And A, you can do it. But I'd also like the guys that did the the lifting from the community. Do you think the community is prepared to do that.\nSpeaker 2: As well as they're.\nSpeaker 0: Going.\nSpeaker 13: To turn it over to any of.\nSpeaker 3: You? I think John Noble and Josh, you guys want to just answer?\nSpeaker 10: I'll give it a try here. So the what happened here and why this happened here first is in a city that values affordable housing and is concerned about a lack of affordability, accelerating a lack of affordability in the Reno arts district, where the arts is in their name, they're seeing that artists not be able to afford to live there anymore. That caused a coming together to say, we understand there's a citywide thing, the inclusionary housing ordinance that's been revised. We understand that there's a new and better approach being taken, but none of that is going to require that the affordability be right here and driven by the Reno Arts District, need to keep affordability, especially if it can be preferred towards artists. Maybe that's not in the regulations, but but encouraged that that brought the conversation here. First, it's my belief that if we figure out how to do incentives, zoning, right, where if you do this, if you afford this affordability, you get significantly higher development potential, then this is something we can replicate , adapt and learn from at other station areas because it's been commented on by council here tonight. It's it's a shame that although we're getting more density around station areas, it's generally market rate and being near a station is hot and so that gets bid up and there's not a lot of affordability unless you're lucky enough to have a nonprofit, do some land banking in that area. And then you get sort of one thing that's affordable, but you don't generally incentivize affordability. So I think this is a laboratory and we're going to try we've we've tried incentive zoning in Denver before, not too far from here, Arapahoe Square. There were far incentives that essentially nobody ever took advantage of. So we had a lots of discussions to say, how can we do this better? And part of it is not asking too much that people won't want to do it, but also offering a significant enough bonus. If you look at the difference between the numbers and the colors on the map on page seven, you'll see it's a significant bonus that we hope people will choose to take and have. The affordability not only happen, but happen here.\nSpeaker 8: Yeah, actually, you're the right person. And this is going to go to both of you guys. And this is not intended to sting, but I would like to have you guys on record. So there's both numbers. I mean, there's numbers and colors. There's checkerboard mean dashed lines, defining where those numbers are. How fluid are those lines? Because remember, we've had other rezonings where there's clear delineation on a map where people have negotiated and discussed where those where these heights are supposed to be. Now we're talking about where these bonuses are supposed to be. But if you have a developer that wants to cross that line, is, is that part of the plan?\nSpeaker 10: I'll try as a community member and then hand it to the office. These these were refined and refined and refined with multiple community meetings, and they moved by half a block. And if you look at some of the shading in the Cole area, on the right side of the diagram, you'll see them stepping down in these very deliberate stair steps. So as a community member, I would be disturbed if if these didn't describe an envelope within which buildings were built.\nSpeaker 8: Great. I have that on record. Is that the intention of CPD as well?\nSpeaker 13: Yes, the intention is that this map guides future map amendments. The area in particular that Joel just described is one where, you know, there might be a little bit of interpretation necessary to decide exactly where the boundary is. But the intent is pretty clear that the development is stepping down towards the neighborhood and will be furthering that conversation. When we look at the tools that are in the design overlay as well to see exactly how that's going to be accomplished.\nSpeaker 3: Can I bring Justin up as well? Justin, we actually Councilman Espinosa, you're going to feel really proud right now. We actually had the conversation because you brought it up. Obviously, it was in my district when you brought it up. But we it was I want you to give your interpretation of a community's perspective in dealing with that developer who took that line further than than it had in the actual plan document.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.\nSpeaker 13: So you're talking about there's a developer I mean, you're talking about the same example between Larimer and Walnut Street. You know, you got five stories that stops Mid-Block, but the language is a little bit ambiguous. So on the one hand, if you've got a neighborhood that's not particularly. Organized. I think that can be a real negative because it'd be pretty easy to push that line. Fortunately, I think we have been having conversations for three or four years now about what livability looks like in our district and our tools to be able to influence that have been somewhat limited when it comes to development specifically and even more specifically, more institutional type development that isn't modeled after more of a mixed use sort of format. So if you've got a community that really I think has its priorities identified and can use the fact that changing that zoning requires the developer to get the community's support or they're not going to get the community support vocally . It's actually a way to influence the design. So because we didn't have a design overlay and because of that full block development, I mean, it's a full block, it will have a massive impact on the community for its life for 50 plus years. So that development had no active ground floor uses its, you know, its active uses or the leasing center in the gym in the typical situation. So we were able to sit down with them and have what was initially a pretty difficult conversation, but actually turned into a fairly amicable one where we said, if you activate these corners , if you move your live work units to Walnut Street to help activate that space, because artists could potentially use those as galleries as well, then we will support this shifting of this line. And I think that the the way that the neighborhood actually lives shifting that line has less of a negative impact than four sides of a dead block development. That's an entire city block. So but I think the prerequisite for that is that the neighborhoods already had the conversation, really worked out what its goals are, and then is able to use that tool to sort of implement those and influence the design. So I would say for the entire process, the really the same thing applies where, you know, the end result of this is there's value that's being given, there's entitlement that's been given. And so how do we capture it and make sure that there's a give back factor to the community or all the work that leads up to that is what is that give back factor and why is it important? And how do you build sort of, I guess, unity around those ideas? So, you know, we started with neighborhood meetings with seven people in 2012 and said, what is regional look like in the future? What is a really urban, livable neighborhood look like? And right now it's a little bit of a blank slate and then tracked through a lot of those priorities over years. When faced with this opportunity and said there's an ask that there be additional height given we had the conversation, what is the tradeoff? What are the downsides of potentially giving away this density? And how do we turn this into a positive for the community?\nSpeaker 8: Are there plans? Is there is there language already in there or plan to be language that you can't even if you have ground for activation, that you can't have 100% residential development in certain locations?\nSpeaker 13: Or we are contemplating that for the design overlay.\nSpeaker 8: Okay, great. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilman Espinosa. Councilman. And thank you, Jason. Councilman Ortega.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask a question of either Justin or maybe even Joel about. Whether the issue of train safety came up, where we're talking about adding, you know, higher densities of people adjacent to this particular, you know, station area where obviously there there's an interest to see more development happening. But the the issue of train safety is something that we've been talking about, particularly where we have, you know, these corridors that carry freight and specifically flammable liquids and hazardous materials. And so can somebody speak to whether or not that issue came up at all? And, you know, as part of this this big picture planning for this area. So if you do speak to it, it did not.\nSpeaker 13: But yeah, I don't think it it really came up. Joel, did you have anything you wanted to add or Andy?\nSpeaker 9: I mean, I understand the entire area is not next to the track.\nSpeaker 14: And Councilwoman in.\nSpeaker 9: The area where I mean, we know that that corridor, you know, will have development on both sides of those tracks. And so where we have development that will be happening adjacent to the tracks. I'm just curious to know whether that was even discussed, because it's a real issue.\nSpeaker 14: So, Councilman, you have actually we've talked about this, I think, for a couple of years now, and it's a it's a absolutely justifiable concern. And we did not discuss it. You know, if you look at the riverfront area behind Union Station, you've got development on all sides of those tracks throughout that entire area. And I don't see why this would be any different. So we just it wasn't something that came up in the course of our steering committee discussion.\nSpeaker 9: Well, and you need to know that those residents who live down in that area are some of the very first people who started raising this question as a real concern. And it would be different if we didn't have the kind of flammable liquids that travel through this city and oftentimes stage in the center of the city and more frequently actually stage in this very corridor where we're talking about this development, where the potential impact to human life and property could be catastrophic, you know, with the wrong situation occurring. And so just planning appropriately for how we deal with that becomes really vital to ensure that we're doing our job. When we say we're truly addressing health, safety and welfare of the communities that we're going to, you know, encourage to live. And or work in these developments that happen to be right next to, you know, trains to carry these products. So I appreciate you addressing the question. I just raise the concern and we will continue to do that. We have work that was done by a working group that was chaired by our fire chief. We've got a report that was submitted to the mayor. We've got next steps to then meet with the development community before our agencies start to actually utilize the recommendations that came out of that. And so stay tuned. This issue is not isolated to this corridor. We have this challenge all across the city where we will have transit lines adjacent to these freight lines and where we will see continued pressure for large and higher density development, where I think it's inherent or incumbent upon us to really be looking at doing the right thing.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. There's no more questions. A public hearing for Council Bill 760 is now closed. Comments by members of council. I call on myself. Why not? Right. It's 11:00. The last bill was the most important bill that I've been a part of. And since I've been on city council, this bill is probably. The most intriguing cool bill that I've been a part of. And here's why we had the number was actually 250 people at the meeting and there were architects, developers and folks from coal Curtis Park, Whittier, Gloria, Swansea during a time of Platt to Park here. So they actually showed up to the meeting upset and came by and came back in all of the tables that there were intermixed with all of these professionals. And we had one of the most fruitful discussions. And I think that's why you see an empty room and not pitchforks and, you know, everything else, because we really did have a good conversation around, you know, we don't want to be bolder. So let's talk about heights because if you don't have the ability for density in a city. It's a supply and demand factor. And so your homes are going to be mostly expensive. And so we had a great discussion. This is not over. This is just the plan amendment. The last time a plan has been amended in the city of Denver, 90 to 91, I believe it is. So this is really cool. And we hope that we can continue doing this, that small area plans do get a chance to get amended, be amended for more certainty for for neighbors and business folks alike. So I will be supporting this. You will see us again at a legislative rezoning once the regulatory framework of affordable housing has been set. Once the overlay district of the design standard. When I got to I got to think, you know, Justin Croft and a lot of folks at Rhino for really working hard on that. But thank you CPD for your involvement. And if you hadn't done this before and I feel like you're super flexible. And Tim in Utah, Salt Lake City somewhere. Thank you, buddy. You've been amazing. Councilman Lockett. Councilman Espinosa.\nSpeaker 8: Oh, yeah. Just thank you to Abe. Thank you to Tim. If you're watching and CPD and all the stakeholders help get this hate amendment through. It was a real pleasure when it came to committee to see this, because this is exactly what we've been thinking we needed to be doing for a long time. And I'm a proponent for wisely incorporating density in mixed income developments near TOD sites. So I believe these height amendments are a step in the right direction along with your guidelines and standards that are in the future. So just well done, well done to CPD staff and the community and everyone involved. So thank you.\nSpeaker 3: AS Hear that. ESPINOSA Well done. All right, Councilman Clark.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Mr. President. Lots of talk about density and affordable housing. I just wanted to, before it got away, point out that what this does in terms of focus on the river, I think is unique in Denver and I think can set a precedent for how we treat the river and development that the river is not the back where you put all of your utilities and all of the bad stuff that we treat the river as a street, as a main street, as the front door to your building. And I think that's absolutely critical as we continue to revitalize and restore our river. And I hope that this is kind of we can all look back as we're walking up and down the riverfront in Denver for decades to come and say this is what really started not making that voluntary anymore, making that something that we as a city value and that we require. So I thank you for that. I'm really excited. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 3: And thank you, Councilman Clark. Great comments, Councilwoman Black.\nSpeaker 6: I think it's really incredibly cool.\nSpeaker 7: And so kudos to all of you. And someday in District four, maybe we'll have one plan. Maybe someday we can amend it.\nSpeaker 3: But that Councilwoman Black, that was the perfect way to end tonight is remove to say Madam Secretary Rocha.\nSpeaker 5: Black Eye Clarke, I Espinosa Flynn, I. Gilmore, I. Herndon, i cashman. Kenny Lopez. I Knew Ortega Susman. Mr. President.\nSpeaker 3: I close vote. Announce the results.\nSpeaker 5: Councilwoman Black.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman Black. You are hanging fire keeping.\nSpeaker 5: 39. Wow.","label":1}

{"text":"A powerful truncated Newton method for potential energy minimization\n\nWith advances in computer architecture and software, Newton methods are becoming not only feasible for large\u2010scale nonlinear optimization problems, but also reliable, fast and efficient. Truncated Newton methods, in particular, are emerging as a versatile subclass. In this article we present a truncated Newton algorithm specifically developed for potential energy minimization. The method is globally convergent with local quadratic convergence. Its key ingredients are: (1) approximation of the Newton direction far away from local minima, (2) solution of the Newton equation iteratively by the linear Conjugate Gradient method, and (3) preconditioning of the Newton equation by the analytic second\u2010derivative components of the \u201clocal\u201d chemical interactions: bond length, bond angle and torsional potentials. Relaxation of the required accuracy of the Newton search direction diverts the minimization search away from regions where the function is nonconvex and towards physically interesting regions. The preconditioning strategy significantly accelerates the iterative solution for the Newton search direction, and therefore reduces the computation time for each iteration. With algorithmic variations, the truncated Newton method can be formulated so that storage and computational requirements are comparable to those of the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient method. As the convergence rate of nonlinear Conjugate Gradient methods is linear and performance less predictable, the application of the truncated Newton code to potential energy functions is promising.","label":0}

{"text":"The periodic table is instantly recognizable. It's not just in every chemistry lab worldwide, it's found on t-shirts, coffee mugs, and shower curtains. But the periodic table isn't just another trendy icon. It's a massive slab of human genius, up there with the Taj Mahal, the Mona Lisa, and the ice cream sandwich \u2014 and the table's creator, Dmitri Mendeleev, is a bonafide science hall-of-famer. But why? What's so great about him and his table? Is it because he made a comprehensive list of the known elements? Nah, you don't earn a spot in science Valhalla just for making a list. Besides, Mendeleev was far from the first person to do that. Is it because Mendeleev arranged elements with similar properties together? Not really, that had already been done too. So what was Mendeleev's genius? Let's look at one of the first versions of the periodic table from around 1870. Here we see elements designated by their two-letter symbols arranged in a table. Check out the entry of the third column, fifth row. There's a dash there. From that unassuming placeholder springs the raw brilliance of Mendeleev. That dash is science. By putting that dash there, Dmitri was making a bold statement. He said \u2014 and I'm paraphrasing here \u2014 Y'all haven't discovered this element yet. In the meantime, I'm going to give it a name. It's one step away from aluminum, so we'll call it eka-aluminum, \"eka\" being Sanskrit for one. Nobody's found eka-aluminum yet, so we don't know anything about it, right? Wrong! Based on where it's located, I can tell you all about it. First of all, an atom of eka-aluminum has an atomic weight of 68, about 68 times heavier than a hydrogen atom. When eka-aluminum is isolated, you'll see it's a solid metal at room temperature. It's shiny, it conducts heat really well, it can be flattened into a sheet, stretched into a wire, but its melting point is low. Like, freakishly low. Oh, and a cubic centimeter of it will weigh six grams. Mendeleev could predict all of these things simply from where the blank spot was, and his understanding of how the elements surrounding it behave. A few years after this prediction, a French guy named Paul Emile Lecoq de Boisbaudran discovered a new element in ore samples and named it gallium after Gaul, the historical name for France. Gallium is one step away from aluminum on the periodic table. It's eka-aluminum. So were Mendeleev's predictions right? Gallium's atomic weight is 69.72. A cubic centimeter of it weighs 5.9 grams. it's a solid metal at room temperature, but it melts at a paltry 30 degrees Celcius, 85 degrees Fahrenheit. It melts in your mouth and in your hand. Not only did Mendeleev completely nail gallium, he predicted other elements that were unknown at the time: scandium, germanium, rhenium. The element he called eka-manganese is now called technetium. Technetium is so rare it couldn't be isolated until it was synthesized in a cyclotron in 1937, almost 70 years after Dmitri predicted its existence, 30 years after he died. Dmitri died without a Nobel Prize in 1907, but he wound up receiving a much more exclusive honor. In 1955, scientists at UC Berkeley successfully created 17 atoms of a previously undiscovered element. This element filled an empty spot in the perodic table at number 101, and was officially named Mendelevium in 1963. There have been well over 800 Nobel Prize winners, but only 15 scientists have an element named after them. So the next time you stare at a periodic table, whether it's on the wall of a university classroom or on a five-dollar coffee mug, Dmitri Mendeleev, the architect of the periodic table, will be staring back.","label":1}

{"text":" The following is a conversation with Jed Buckwald, a professor of history and a philosopher of science at Caltech. Interested especially in the development of scientific concepts and the instruments used to create and explore new effects and ideas in science. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here is my conversation with Jed Buckwald. Does science progress via paradigm shifts and revolutions as philosopher Thomas Kuhn said, or does it progress gradually? What do you think? Well, I got into this field because I was Tom Kuhn's research assistant 50 years ago, 52 years ago. He pulled me into it out of physics instead. So I know his work pretty well. And in the years when I was at MIT running an institute, he was then in the philosophy department, used to come over all the time to the talks we held and so on. So what would I say about that? He, of course, developed his ideas a lot over the years. The thing that he's famous for, the structure of scientific revolutions came out in 62. And as you just said, it offered an outline for what he called a paradigmatic structure, namely the notion that you have to look at what scientists do as forming a community of investigators. And that they're trying to solve various puzzles, as he would put it, that crop up, figuring out how this works, how that works and so on. And of course, they don't do it out of the blue. They do it within a certain framework. The framework can be pretty vague. He called it a paradigm. And his notion was that eventually they run into troubles or what he called anomalies. That kind of cracks things. Somebody new comes along with a different way of doing it, etc. Do I think things work that way? No, not really. Tom and I used to have lengthy discussions about that over the years. I do think there is a common structure that formulates both theoretical and experimental practices. And historians nowadays of science like to refer to scientific work as what scientists practice. It's almost craftsman-like. They can usually adapt in various ways. And I can give you all kinds of examples of that. I once wrote a book on the origins of wave theory of light. And that is one of the paradigmatic examples that Tom used. Only it didn't work that way exactly. Because he thought that what happened was that the wave theory ran into trouble with a certain phenomenon, which it couldn't crack. Well, it turned out that, in fact, historically that phenomenon was actually not relevant later on to the wave theory. And when the wave theory came in, the alternative to it, which had prevailed, which was Newton's views of light as particles, that it seemed couldn't explain what the wave theory could explain. Again, not true. Not true. Much more complex than that. The wave theory offered the opportunity to deploy novel experimental and mathematical structures, which gave younger scientists, mathematicians and others, the opportunity to effect, manufacture, make new sorts of devices. It's not that the alternative couldn't sort of explain these things, but it never was able to generate them de novo as novelties. In other words, if you think of it as something scientists wanted to progress in the sense of finding new stuff to solve, then I think what often happens is that it's not so much that the prevailing view can't crack something as that it doesn't give you the opportunity to do new stuff. When you say new stuff, are we referring to experimental science here or new stuff in the space of new theories? Could be both. Could be both, actually. So how does that, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the story of the wave? Sure. The prevailing view of light, at least in France, where the wave theory really first took off, although it had been introduced in England by Thomas Young, the prevailing theory dates back to Newton, that light is a stream of particles and that refraction and reflection involve sort of repulsive and attractive forces that deflect and bend the paths of these particles. Newton was not able successfully to deal with the phenomenon of what happens when light goes past a knife's edge or a sharp edge, what we now call diffraction. He had cooked up something about it that no mathematical structure could be applied. Thomas Young first, but really this guy named Augustin Fresnel in France, deployed, in Fresnel's case, rather advanced calculus forms of mathematics which enabled computations to be done and observations to be melded with these computations in a way that you could not do or see how to do with Newton. Did that mean that the Newtonian explanation of what goes on in diffraction fails? Not really. You can actually make it work, but you can't generate anything new out of it. Whereas using the mathematics of wave optics in respect to a particular phenomenon called polarization, which ironically was discovered by partisans of Newton's way of doing things, you were able to generate devices which reflect light in crystals, do various things, that the Newtonian way could accommodate only after the fact. They couldn't generate it from the beginning. And so if you want to be somebody who is working a novel vein, which increasingly becomes the case with people who become what we now call physicists in the 1820s, 30s, and 40s in particular, then that's the direction you're going to go. But there were holdouts until the 1850s. I want to try to elaborate on the nature of the disagreement you have with Thomas Kuhn. So do you still believe in paradigm shifts? Do you still see that there is ideas that really have a transformational effect on science? The nature of the disagreement has to do with how those paradigm shifts come to be? How they come to be and how they change. I certainly think they exist. How strong they may be at any given time is maybe not quite as powerful as Tom thought in general, although towards the end of his life, he was beginning to develop different modifications of his original way of thinking. But I don't think that the changes happen quite so neatly, if you will, in reaction to novel experimental observations. They get much more complex than that. In terms of neatness, how much of science progresses by individual lone geniuses and how much by the messy collaboration of competing and cooperating humans? I don't think you can cut that with a knife to say it's this percent and that percent. It's almost always the case that there are one or two or maybe three individuals who are sort of central to what goes on when things begin to shift. Are they inevitably and solely responsible for what then begins to happen in a major way? I think not. It depends. You can go very far back with this, even into antiquity to see what goes on. The major locus we always talk about from the beginning is if you're talking about Galileo's work on motion, for example, were there ways of accommodating it that others could adapt to without buying into the whole scheme? Yes. Did it eventually evolve and start convincing people because you could also do other things with it that you couldn't otherwise do? Also, yes. Let me give you an example. The great French mathematician philosopher Descartes, who was a mechanical philosopher, he believed the world was matter in motion, he never thought much of what Galileo had done in respect to motion because he thought, well, at best it's some sort of approximative scheme or something like that. But one of his initial, I wouldn't call him a disciple, but follower who then broke with him in a number of ways was a man named Christian Huygens, who was, along with Newton, one of the two greatest scientists of the 17th century. Huygens is older than Newton. Huygens nicely deployed Galilean relationships in respect to motion to develop all sorts of things, including the first pendulum governed clock and even figured out how to build one, which keeps perfect time, except it didn't work, but he had the mathematical structure for it. How well known is Huygens? Oh, very well known. Should I know him well? Yes, you should. Interesting. You should definitely know him. No, no, no, no. Can we define should here? Okay. Because I don't. Right. So is this should like, yeah, can you define should? Should means this. If you had taken up to a second year of physics courses, you should, you would have heard his name because one of the fundamental principles in optics is called Huygens principle. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So I have, and I have heard his name. There you go. No, but I don't remember. But you don't remember. So, I mean, there's a very different thing between names attached to principles and laws and so on that you sometimes let go of. You just remember the equations of the principles themselves and the personalities of science. And there's certain personalities, certain human beings that stand out. And that's why there's a sense to which the lone inventor, the lone scientists is the way I personally, I mean, I think a lot of people think about the history of science is these lone geniuses without them. The sense is if you remove Newton from the picture, if you remove Galileo from the picture, then science would, there's almost a feeling like it would just have stopped there. Or at the very least, there's a feeling like it would take much longer to develop the things that were developed. Is that a silly way to look at the history? That's not entirely incorrect, I suppose. I find it difficult to believe that had Galileo not existed, that eventually someone like Huygens, for instance, given the context of the time, what was floating around in the belief structure concerning the nature of the world and so on, the developments in mathematics and whatnot, that sooner or later, whether it would have been exactly the same or not, I cannot say. But would things have evolved? Evolved? Yes. If we look at the long arc of history of science, from back when we were in the caves trying to knock two rocks together or maybe make a basic tool to a long time from now, many centuries from now when human civilization finally destroys itself. If you look at that history and imagine you're a historian at the end, like with the fire of the apocalypse coming upon us, and you look back at this time in the 21st century, how far along are we on that arc? Do you sense? Have we invented and discovered everything that's to be discovered or are we at like below 1%? You're going to get a lot of absurd questions today. I apologize. It's a lugubrious picture you're painting there. I don't even know what the word lugubrious means, but I love it. Lugubrious. Well, let me try and separate the question of whether we're all going to die in an apocalypse in several hundred years or not from the question of where science may be sitting. Take this as an assumption. Okay. I find that hard to say. I find it hard to say because in the deepest sense of the term, as it's usually deployed by philosophers of science today, I'm not fundamentally a realist. That is to say, I think our access to the inner workings of nature is inevitably mediated by what we can do with the materials and factors around us. We can probe things in various ways. Does that mean that I don't think that the standard model in quantum electrodynamics is in... Of course not. I wouldn't even dream of saying such a thing. It can do a lot, especially when it comes to figuring out what's happening in very large expensive particle accelerators and applying results in cosmology and so on as well. Do I think that we have inevitably probed the depths of reality through this? I do not agree with Steven Weinberg who thinks we have about such things. Do I, on the other hand, think that the way in which science has been moving for the last 100 years, physics in particular is what I have in mind, will continue on the same course? In that sense, I don't because we're not going to be building bigger and bigger and more and more expensive machines to rip apart particles in various ways. In which case, what are physicists going to do? They'll turn their attention to other aspects. There are all sorts of things we've never explained about the material world. We don't have theories that go beyond a certain point for all sorts of things. Can we, for example, start with the standard model and work our way up all the way to chemical transformations? You can make an argument about it and you can justify things, but in chemistry, that's not the way people work. They work with much higher level quantum mechanical relationships and so on. This notion of the deep theory to explain everything is a long-standing belief which goes back pretty far, although I think it only takes its fullest form sometime towards the end of the 19th century. Maybe we just speak to that. You're referring to a hope, a dream, a reality of coming up with a theory of everything that explains everything. There's a very specific thing that currently means in physics, is the unification of the laws of physics. I'm sure in antiquity or before it meant maybe something else or is it always about physics? I think as you've implied, in physics there's a sense once you get to the theory of everything, you've understood everything, but there's a very deep sense in which you've actually understood not very much at all. You've understood at that particular level how things work, but you don't understand how the abstractions on top of abstractions form. Or you don't understand how the abstractions on top of abstractions form all the way to the chemistry, to the human mind, and the human societies and all those kinds of things. Maybe you can speak to the theory of everything in its history and comment on what the heck does that even mean, the theory of everything. Well, I don't think you can go back that far with something like that, maybe to the, at best to the 17th century. If you go back all the way in antiquity, there are of course discussions about the nature of the world. But first of all, you have to recognize that the manipulative character of physics and chemistry, the probing of, let me put it this way, we assume and have known for a long time, I'll come back to when in a moment, that if I take a little device, which is really complicatedly made out of all kinds of things, and I put a piece of some material in it, and I monkey around with it and do all kinds of unnatural things to it, things that wouldn't happen naturally, and I find out how it behaves and whatnot. And then I try and make an argument about how that really applies even in the natural world without any artificial structures and so on. That's not a belief that was widely held by pretty much anyone until sometime maybe in the 1500s. And when it was first held, it was held by people we now call alchemists. So alchemy was the first, the early days of the theory of everything, of a dream of a theory of everything. I would put it a little differently. I think it's more along the way a dream that by probing nature in artificially constructed ways, we can find out what's going on deep down there. So that was, that's distinct from science being an observing thing where you observe nature and you study nature. You're talking about probing, like messing with nature to understand it. Indeed I am, but that of course is the very essence of experimental science. You have to manipulate nature to find out things about it, and then you have to convince others that you haven't so manipulated it that what you've done is to produce what amounts to fake, artifactual behavior that doesn't really hold purely naturally. So where are we today in your sense to jump around a little bit with the theory of everything? Maybe a quick kind of sense you have about the journey in the world of physics that we're taking towards the theory of everything. Well, I'm of course not a practicing physicist. I mean, I was trained in physics at Princeton a long time ago. Until Thomas Kuhn stole you away. More or less. I was taking graduate courses in those days in general relativity. I was an undergraduate, but I moved up and then I took a course with him. Well, you made the mistake of being compelled by charismatic philosophers and never looked back. I suppose so in a way. From what I understand, talking especially to my friends at Caltech, like Kip Thorne and others, the fundamental notion is that actually the laws that even at the deepest level we can sort of divine and work with in the universe that we inhabit are perhaps quite unique to this particular universe as it formed at the Big Bang. The question is, how deep does it go? If you are very mathematically inclined, the prevailing notion for several decades now has been what's called string theory, but that has not been able to figure a way to generate probative experimental evidence, although it's pretty good apparently at accommodating things. Then the question is, what's before the Big Bang? Actually, the word before doesn't mean anything given the nature of time, but why do we have the laws that prevail in our universe? Well, there is a notion that those laws prevail in our universe because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here. That's a bit of a cyclical but nevertheless, a compelling definition. There's all kinds of things like it seems like the unification of those laws could be discovered by looking inside of a black hole because you get both the general relativity and the quantum mechanics, quantum field theory in there. Experimentally, of course, there's a lot of interesting ideas. We can't really look close to the Big Bang. We can't look that far back. Caltech and MIT will lie go looking at gravitational waves, perhaps allows us to march backwards and so on. It's a really exciting space. There's of course the theory of everything, like with a lot of things in science, captivates the dreams of those who are perhaps completely outside of science. It's the dream of discovering the key to the nature of how everything works. That feels deeply human. That's perhaps the thing, the basic elements of what makes up a scientist in the end is that curiosity, that longing to understand. Let me ask, you mentioned a disagreement with Weinberg on reality. Could you elaborate a little bit? Obviously, I don't disagree with Steve Weinberg on physics itself. I wouldn't know enough to even begin to do that. Clearly, he's one of the founders of the standard model and so on. It works to a level of accuracy that no physical theorist can ever understand. A level of accuracy that no physical theory has ever worked at before. I suppose the question in my mind is something that in one way could go back to the philosopher Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, namely, can we really ever convince ourselves that we have come to grips with something that is not in itself knowable to us by our senses or even except in the most remote way through the complex instruments that we make as to what it is that underlies everything? Can we corral it with mathematics and experimental structures? Yes. Do I think that a particular way of corralling nature will inevitably play itself out? I don't know. It always has. I'll put it to you that way. The basic question is, can we know reality? Is that the con question? Is that the Weinberg question? We humans, with our brains, can we comprehend reality? Sounds like a very trippy question because a lot of it rests on definitions of know and comprehend and reality, but get to the bottom of it. Turtles on top of turtles. Can we get to the bottom turtle and say hello? Well, maybe I can put it to you this way in a way that I often begin discussions in a class on the history of science and so on and say, I'm looking at you. You are in fact a figment of my imagination. You have a messed up imagination, yes. Well, what do I mean by that? If I were a dragonfly looking at you, whatever my nervous system would form by way of a perceptual structure would clearly be utterly different from what my brain and perceptual system altogether is forming when I look at you. Who's right? Is it me or the dragonfly? Well, the dragonfly is certainly very impressive, so I don't know. But yes, the observer matters. Well, what is that supposed to tell us about objective reality? Well, I think it means that it's very difficult to get beyond the constructs that our perceptual system is leading us to. When we make apparatus and devices and so on, we're still making things, the results of which are the outputs of which we process perceptually in various ways. An analogy I like to use with the students sometimes is this. All right, they all have their laptops open in front of them, of course. I've sent them something to read and I say, okay, click on it and open it up. So PDF opens up. I said, what are you looking at? They said, well, I'm looking at the paper that you sent me. I said, no, you're not. What you're looking at is a stream of light coming off LEDs or LCDs coming off a screen. And I said, what happens when you use your mouse and move that fake piece of paper on the screen around? What are you doing? You're not moving a piece of paper around, are you? You're moving a construct around, a construct that's being processed so that our perceptual system can interact with it in the way we interact with pieces of paper. But it's not real. So are there things outside of the reach of science? Can you maybe, as an example, talk about consciousness? I'm asking for a friend, trying to figure this thing out. Well, boy, I mean, I read a fair bit about that, but I certainly can't really say much about it. I'm a materialist in the deepest sense of the term. I don't think there is anything out there except material structures which interact in various ways. Do I have to say that? I think, for example, that this bottle of water is conscious? No, I do not. Although how would I know? I can't talk to it. It's a hypothesis you have. It's an opinion, an educated opinion that may be very wrong. Well, I know that you're conscious because I can interact directly with you. But am I? Well, unless you're a figment of my imagination, of course. Or I'm a robot that's able to generate the illusion of consciousness effectively enough to facilitate a good conversation, because we humans do want to pretend that we're talking to other conscious beings, because that's how we respect them. If it's not conscious, we don't respect them. We're not good at talking to robots. That's true. Of course, we generalize from our own inner sense, which is the kind of thing Descartes said from the beginning. We generalize from that. But I do think that consciousness must be something, whatever it is, that occurs as a result of some particular organizational structure of material elements. Does materialism mean that it's all within the reach of science? My sense would be that especially as neuroscience progresses more and more, and at Caltech we just built a whole neuroscience arena and so on, and as more knowledge is gained about the ways in which animals, when they behave, what patterns show up at various parts of the brain and nervous system, and perhaps extending it to humans eventually as well, we'll get more of a handle on what brain activity is associated with experiences that we have as humans. Can we move from the brain activity to the experiences in terms of our person? No, you can't. Brain is perception. That's a hypothesis once again. Maybe consciousness is just one of the laws of physics that's yet to be discovered. Maybe it permeates all matter. Maybe it's as simple as trying to plug it in and plug into the ability to generate and control that kind of law of physics that would crack open, or we would understand that the bottled water is in fact conscious, just much less conscious than us humans, and then we would be able to then generate beings that are more conscious. Well, that'll be unfortunate. I'd have to stop drinking the water after that. Every time you take a sip, there's a little bit of a suffering going on. What do you think is the most interesting, beautiful moments in the history of science? What stands out? Then we can pull at that thread. Right. Well, I like to think of events that have a major impact and involve both beautiful conceptual, mathematical, if we're talking physical structures work, and are associated as well with probing experimental situations. Among my favorites is one of the most famous, which was the young Isaac Newton's work with the colors produced when you pass sunlight through a prism. Why do I like that? It's not profoundly mathematical in one sense. It doesn't need it initially. It needs the following though, which begins to show you, I think, a little bit about what gets involved when you've got a smart individual who's trying to monkey around with stuff and finds new things about it. First let me say that the notion, the prevailing notion going back to antiquity was that colors are produced in a sense by modifying or tinting white light, that they're modifications of white light. In other words, the colors are not in the sunlight in any way. Now, what Newton did following experiments done by Descartes before him, who came to very different conclusions, he took a prism. You might ask, where do you get prisms in the 1660s? That's the question. County fairs. They were very popular. They were pretty crude with bubbles in them and everything, but they produced colors, so you could buy them at county fairs and things, very popular. They were modifying the white light to create colors. Well, they were creating colors from it, well known. What he did was the following. He was by this time, even though he's very young, a very good mathematician. He could use the then known laws for how light behaves when it goes through glass to calculate what should happen if you took light from the sun, passed it from a hole through a little hole, then hit the prism, goes out of the prism, strikes a wall a long distance away and makes a splash of light. Never mind the colors for a moment. Makes a splash of light there. He was very smart. First of all, he abstracts from the colors themselves, even though that's what everybody's paying attention to initially. What he knows is this. He knows that if you take this prism and you turn it to a certain particular angle that he knew what it should be because he could calculate things. Very few other people in Europe at the time could calculate things like he could. That if you turn the prism to that particular angle, then the sun, which is of course a circle, when its light passes through this little hole and then into the prism on the far distant wall should still make a circle, but it doesn't. It makes a very long image. This led him to a very different conception of light indicating that there are different types of light in the sunlight. To go beyond that, what's particularly interesting I think is the following. When he published this paper, which got him into a controversy, he really didn't describe at all what he did. He just gave you some numbers. Now I just told you that you had to set this prism at a certain angle. You would think, because we do have his notes and so on, you would think that he took some kind of complicated measuring device to set the prism. He didn't. He held it in his hand. That's all. He twiddled it around. What was he doing? It turns out that when you twiddle the prism around at the point where you should get a circle from a circle, it also is the place where the image does not move very fast. If you want to get close to there, you just twiddle it. This is manipulative experimentation taking advantage through his mathematical knowledge of the inherent inaccuracies that let you come to exact conclusions regardless of the built-in problematics of measurement. He's the only one I know of doing anything like that at this time. At the time. Yeah. There's very few people that are able to calculate as well as he did to be a theoretician and an experimentalist in the same moment. It's true, although until really well into the 20th century, maybe the beginning of the 20th century really, most of the most significant experimental results produced in the 1800s, which laid the foundations for light, electricity, electrodynamics, and so on, even hydrodynamics and whatnot, were also produced by people who were both excellent calculators, very talented mathematicians, and good with their hands experimentally. That led to the 21st century with Enrico Fermi that one of the last people that was able to do both of those things very well, and that he built a little device called an atomic bomb that has some positives and negatives. Well, right, of course that actually did involve some pretty large scale elaborate equipment. While holding a prism in your hands. Right, no. What's the controversy that you'd gotten into with that paper when you published it? In a number of ways, it's a complicated story. There was a very talented character known as a mechanic. Mechanic means somebody who was a craftsman who could build and make really good stuff. He was very talented. His name was Robert Hook. He was the guy who at the weekly meetings of the Royal Society in London, and Newton's not in London, he's at Cambridge, he's a young guy. He would demonstrate new things. He was very clever. He had written a book, in fact, called The Micrographia, which by the way, he used a microscope to make the first depictions of things like a fly's eye, the structure of, you know, it had a big influence. And in there, he also talked about light. And so he had a different view of light. When he read what Newton wrote, he had a double reaction. On the one hand, he said, anything in there that is correct, I already knew. And anything that I didn't already know is probably not right anyway. I got a love egos. Okay. Can you, can we just step back? Can you say who was Isaac Newton? What are the things he contributed to this world in the space of ideas? Wow. Who was he? He was born in 1642 and near the small town of Grantham in England. In fact, the house he was born in and that his mother died in is still there and can be visited. His father died before he was born. And his mother eventually remarried a man named Reverend Smith, whom Newton did not like at all. Because Reverend Smith took his mother away to live with him a few miles away, leaving Newton to be brought up more or less by his grandmother over there. And he had huge resentment about that his whole life. I think that gives you a little inkling that a little bit of trauma in childhood, maybe a complicated father-son relationship can be useful to create a good scientist. Could be, although in this case it would be right, the absent father-nonfather relationship, so to speak. He was known as a kid, little that we do know for being very clever about flying kites. And there are stories about him putting candles and flying kites and scaring the living devil out of people at night by doing that and things like that, making things. Most of the physicists and natural philosophers I've dealt with actually as children were very fond of making and playing with things. I can't think of one I know of who wasn't actually. They were very good with their hands and whatnot. His mother wanted him to take over the manor. It was a kind of farming manor. They were the class of what are known as yeomans. There are stories that he wasn't very good at that. One day one of the stories is he's sitting out in the field and the cows come home without him and he doesn't know what's going on. He had relatives and he manages to get to Cambridge, sent to Cambridge because he's known to be smart. He's read books that he got from local dignitaries and some relatives. And he goes there as what's known as a subsizer. What does that mean? Well, it's not too pleasant. Basically a subsizer was a student who had to clean the bedpans of the richer kids. That didn't last too long. He makes his way and he becomes absorbed in some of the new ways of thinking that are being talked about on the parts of Descartes and others as well. There's also the traditional curriculum which he follows. And we have his notes. We have his student notebooks and so on. We can see gradually this young man's mind focusing and coming to grips with deeper questions of the nature of the world and perception even and how we know things and also probing and learning mathematical structures to such an extent that he builds on some of the investigations that had been done in the period before him to create the foundations of a way of investigating processes that happen and change continuously instead of by leaps and bounds and so on. Forming the foundation of what we now call the calculus. Can you maybe just paint a little bit of a picture? You've already started. What were the things that bothered him the most, that stood out to him the most about the traditional curriculum, about the way people saw the world? You mentioned discrete versus continuous. Is there something where he began thinking in a revolutionary way? Because it's fascinating. Most of us go to college, Cambridge or otherwise, and we just kind of take what we hear as gospel, right? Like not gospel, but as like facts. You don't begin to sort of see how can I expand on this aggressively or how can I challenge everything that I hear like rigorously, mathematically through the, I mean, I don't even know how rigorous the mathematics was at that point. I'm sure it was geometry and so on. No calculus, huh? There are elements of what turned into the calculus that predate Newton, but- How much rigor was there? How much- Well, rigor, no. And then of course, no scientific method. Not really. I mean, somewhat. I mean, appreciation of data. That is a separate question from a question of method. Appreciation of data is a significant question as to what you do with data. There's lots of things you're asking. I apologize. So maybe let's backtrack. And the first question is, was there something that was bothering him that he especially thought he could contribute or work on? Well, of course, we can't go back and talk to him, but we do have these student notebooks. There's two of them. One's called the philosophical questions and the other is called the waste book. The philosophical questions has discussions of the nature of reality and various issues concerning it. And the waste book has things that have to do with motion in various ways, what happens in collisions and things of that sort. It's a complicated story, but among the things that I think are interesting is he took notes in the philosophical questions on stuff that was traditionally given to you in the curriculums going back several hundred years, namely on what scholars refer to as scholastic or neo-scholastic ways of thinking about the world dating back to the reformulation of Aristotle in the Middle Ages by Thomas Aquinas in the church. This is a totally different way of thinking about things, which actually connects to something we were saying a moment ago. For instance, so I'm wearing a blue shirt and I will sometimes ask students, where is the blue? And they'll usually say, what's in your shirt? And then some of them get clear and they say, well, no, you know, light is striking it, photons are re-emitted, they strike the back of your retina and et cetera, et cetera. And I said, yes, what that means is that the blue is actually an artifact of our perceptual system considered as the percept of blue. It's not out there, it's in here. That's not how things were thought about well into the 16th century. The general notion dating back even to Aristotelian antiquity and formalized by the 12th century at Paris, Oxford and elsewhere is that qualities are there in the world. They're not in us. We have senses and our senses can be wrong. You know, you could go blind, things like that. But if they're working properly, you get the actual qualities of the world. Now that break, which is occurring towards the end of the 16th century and is most visible in Descartes is the break between conceiving that the qualities of the world are very different from the qualities that we perceive. That in fact, the qualities of the world consist almost entirely in shapes of various kinds and maybe hard particles or whatever, but not colors, not sounds, not smells, not softness and hardness. They're not in the world, they're in us. That break Newton is picking up as he reads Descartes. He's going to disagree with a lot in Descartes, but that break he is among other things picking up very strongly. And that underlies a lot of the way he works later on when he becomes skeptical of the evidence provided by the senses. Yeah, that's actually, I don't know, the way you're describing it is so powerful. It just makes me realize how liberating that is as a scientist, as somebody who's trying to understand reality, that our senses are not to be trusted, that reality is to be investigated through tools that are beyond our senses. Yes, or that improve our senses in some ways. That's pretty powerful. That is for a human being, that's like Einstein level. For a human being to realize I can't trust my own senses at that time, that's pretty trippy. It's coming in, it's coming in and I think it arises probably a fair number of decades before that, perhaps in part with all chemical experimentation and manipulations, that you have to go through elaborate structures to produce things and ways you think about it. But let me give you an example that I think you might find interesting because it involves that guy named Hook that Newton had an argument with. And he had lots of arguments with Hook, although Hook was a very clever guy and gave him some things that stimulated him later. Anyway, Hook, who was argumentative and he really was convinced that the only way to gain real knowledge of nature is through carefully constructed devices. And he was an expert mechanic, if you will, at building such things. Now there was a rather wealthy man in Danzig by the name of Hevelius, Latinized name. He was a brewer in town and he had become fascinated with the telescope. This is 30 years or so, 20 or 30 years after the telescope had moved out and become more common. He built a large observatory on the top of his brewery, actually, and working with his wife, they used these very elaborately constructed grass and metal instruments to make observations of positions of the stars. And he published a whole new catalog of where the stars are. And he claimed it was incredibly accurate. He claimed it was so accurate that nothing had ever come close to it. Hook reads this and he says, wait a minute, you didn't use a telescope here of any kind because what's the point? Unless you do something to the telescope, all you see are dots with stars. You just use your eye, your eyes can't be that good. It's impossible. So what did Hook do to prove this? He said, what you should have done is you should have put a little device in the telescope that lets you measure distances between these dots. You didn't do that and because you didn't, there's no way you could have been that good. At two successive meetings of the Royal Society, he hauls the members out into the courtyard and he takes a card and he makes successive black and white stripes on the card and he pastes the card up on a wall and he takes them one by one. He says, now move back looking at it, presumably with one eye until you can't tell the black ones from the white stripes. He says, that I can then measure the distance, I can see the angles, I can give a number then for what is the best possible, what we would call perceptual acuity of human vision. And it turned out, he thought, to be something like 10 or more times worse than this guy Hevelius had claimed. So obviously says Hook Hevelius, well, years ago I calculated Hevelius's numbers and so on using modern tables from NASA and so on and they are even more accurate than Hevelius claimed. But worse than that, the Royal Society sent a young astronomer named Halley over to Danzig to work with him and Halley writes back and he says, I couldn't believe it, but he taught me how to do it and I could get just as good as he, how is it possible? Well here, this shows you something very interesting about experiments, perception and everything else. Hook was right, but he was also wrong. He was wrong for the right reasons and he was right for the wrong reasons. And what do I mean by that? What he actually found was the number for what we now call 20-20 vision. He was right. You can't tell except a few people much better than that. But he was observing the wrong thing. What Hevelius was observing was a bright dot, a star moving past a pointer. Our eyes are rather similar to frogs' eyes. You know, I'm sure you've heard the story, if I hold a dead fly on a string in front of a frog and don't move it, the frog pays no attention. As soon as I move the fly, the frog immediately tongue-lots out because the visual system of the frog responds to motion. So does ours. And our acuity for distinguishing motion from statics, five or more times better. That's fascinating. Damn. And of course, maybe you can comment on their understanding of the human perceptual system at the time was probably really terrible. I've recently been working with almost as a fun side thing with vision scientists and peripheral vision. It's a beautiful complex mess, that whole thing. We still don't understand all the weird ways that human perception works. And they were probably terrible at it. They probably didn't even have any conceptual peripheral vision or the fovea or basically anything. They had some, I mean, because actually it was Newton himself who probed a lot of this. For instance, the young Newton trying to work his way around what's going on with colors, wanted to try and distinguish colors that occur through natural processes out there and colors that are a result of our eyes not operating right. You know what he did? It's a famous thing. He took a stick and he stuck that stick under his lower eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball. And what that did was produced colored circles at diametrically opposite positions of the stick in the eyeball. And he moved it around to see how they moved, trying to distinguish. Legit. Right? I always have to tell my students, don't do this. Or do it if you want to be great and remembered by human history. There's a lot of equivalent to sticking a stick into your eye in modern day that may pay off in the end. Okay. As a small aside, is the Newton and the Apple story true? No. Was it a different fruit? As a colleague of mine named Simon Schaffer in England once said on a NOVA program that we were both on, the role of fruit in the history of science has been vastly exaggerated. Okay. So was there any, I mean, to zoom out, moments of epiphany? Is there something to moments of epiphany? Again, this is the paradigm shift versus the gradualism. There is a shift. It's a much more complex one than that. As it happens, a colleague of mine and I are writing a paper right now on one of the aspects of these things based on the work that many of our colleagues have done over the last 30 and 40 years. Let me try and see if I could put it to you this way. Newton, until the early 1670s and probably really until a fair time after that, first of all was not very interested in questions of motion. He was working actually in all chemical relationships or what is called by historians, chemistry, a kind of early modern chemical structure. Things of ours at Indiana have even reproduced the amalgams that... Anyway, his way of thinking about motion involved a certain set of relationships which was not conducive to any application that would yield computationally direct results for things like planetary motions, which he wasn't terribly interested in anyway. He enters a correspondence with his original nemesis Robert Hooke. Hooke says, well, have you ever thought about... Then Hooke tells him a certain way you might think about it. When Newton hears that, he recognizes that there is a way to inject time that would enable him to solve certain problems. It's not that there was anything he thought before that was contrary to that way of thinking. It's just that that particular technical insight was not something that for a lot of reasons that are complex had never occurred to him at all. That sent him a different way of thinking. But to answer your question about the Apple business, which is always about gravity and the moon and all of that being... No. The reason there is that the idea that what goes on here in the neighborhood of the earth and what goes on at the moon, let us say, remind the sun and the planet, can be due to a direct relationship between the earth, let's say, and the moon is contrary to fundamental beliefs held by many of the mechanical philosophers, as they're called at the time, in which everything has to involve at least a sequence of direct contacts. It has to be something between here and there that's involved. And Hooke, probably not thinking terribly deeply about it based on what he said, along with others like the architect and mathematician Christopher Wren, hearken back to the notion that, well, maybe there is a kind of magnetic relationship between the moon and maybe the planets and the earth and gravity and so on. Vague, but establishing a direct connection somehow, however it's happening, forget about it. Newton wouldn't have cared about that if that's all they said, but it was when Hooke mentioned this different way of thinking about the motion, a way he could certainly have thought of because it does not contradict anything. Newton is a brilliant mathematician and he could see that you could suddenly start to do things with that that you otherwise wouldn't connect. This led eventually to another controversy with Hooke in which Hooke said, well, after Newton published his great Principia, I gave him how to do this. And then Newton, of course, got ticked off about that and said, well, listen to this. I did everything. And because he had a picayune little idea, he thinks he can take credit for it. Okay. So his ability to play with his ideas mathematically is what solidified the initial intuition that you could have. Was that the first time he was born the idea that you have action at a distance, that you can have forces without contact, which is another revolutionary idea? I would say that in the sense of dealing with the mechanics of force-like effects considered to act at some distance, it is novel with both Hooke and Newton at the time. The notion that two things might interact at a distance with one another without direct contact, that goes back to antiquity. Only there it would have thought of more as a sympathetic reaction to a magnet and a piece of iron. They have a kind of mutual sympathy for one another. Like what, love? What are we talking about? Well, actually, they do sometimes talk like that. That is love. See, now I talk like that all the time. I think love is somehow in consciousness or forces of physics that yet to be discovered. Okay. Now there is the other side of things, which is calculus that you began to talk about. So Newton brought a lot of things to this world. One of them is calculus. What is calculus? And what was Newton's role in bringing it to life? What was it like? What was the story of bringing calculus to this world? Well, since the publication starting many decades ago by Tom Whiteside, who is now deceased, of Newton's mathematical papers, we know a lot about how he was pushing things and how he was developing things. It's a complex question to say what calculus is. Calculus is the set of mathematical techniques that enable you to investigate what we now call functions, mathematical functions, which are continuous, that is, that are not formed out of discrete sets like the counting numbers, for instance. Newton, there were already procedures for solving problems involving such things as finding areas under curves and tangents to curves by using geometrical structures, but only for certain limited types of curves, if you will. Newton as a young man, we know this is what happened, is looking at a formula which involves an expansion in separate terms, polynomial terms, as we say, for certain functions. I know I don't want to get complicated here about this, and he realizes it could be generalized, and he tries the generalization, and that leads him to an expansion formula called the binomial theorem. That enables him to move ahead with the notion that if I take something that has a certain value and I add a little bit to it, and I use this binomial theorem and expand things out, I can begin to do new things. The new things that he begins to do leads him to a recognition that the calculations of areas and the calculations of tangents to curves are reciprocal to one another, and the procedures that he develops is a particular form of the calculus in which he considers small increments and then continuous flows and changes of curves and so on. We have relics of it in physics today, the notation in which you put a dot over a variable indicating the rate of change of the variable, that's Newton's original type of notation. The dot. Yeah, the dot notation. Possibly independently of Newton because he didn't publish this thing, although he became quite well known as quite a brilliant young man, in part because people heard about his work and so on. When another young man by the name of Gottfried Leibniz visited London and he heard about these things, it is said that he independently develops his form of the calculus, which is actually the form we use today, both in notation and perhaps in certain fundamental ways of thinking. It has remained a controversial point as to where exactly and how much independently Leibniz did it. Leibniz aficionados think and continue to maintain he did it completely independently. Newton, when he became president of the Royal Society, put together a group to go on the attack saying, no, he must have taken everything. We don't know, but I will tell you this, about 25 or so years ago, a scholar who's a professor at Indiana now named Domenico Melli got his hands on a Leibniz manuscript called the 10 Tammun, which was Leibniz's attempt to produce an alternative to Newton's mechanics. It comes to some conclusions that you have in the Newton's mechanics. Well, he published that, but Melli got the manuscript. What Melli found out was that Leibniz reverse engineered the Principia and cooked it backwards so that he could get the results he wanted. That was for the mechanics, so that means his mind allows for that kind of thing. Some people- You're breaking some news today. You're starting some old drama. Some people think so. I think most historians of mathematics do not agree with that. A friend of mine, rather well-known physicist, unfortunately died a couple of years ago named Mike Nauenberg at UC Santa Cruz, had some evidence along those lines. Didn't pass mustard with many of my friends who are historians of math. In fact, I edit with a historian of math, a technical journal, and we were unable to publish it in there because we couldn't get it through any of our colleagues. But I remain suspicious. What is it about those tense relationships and that kind of drama? Einstein doesn't appear to have much of that drama. Nobody claimed, I haven't heard claims that they've, perhaps because it's such crazy ideas, of any of his major inventions, major ideas being those that are basically, I came up with it first or independently. There's not, as far as I'm aware, not many people talk about general relativity, especially in those terms, but with Newton, that was the case. Is that just a natural outgrowth of how science works? There's going to be personalities that, I'm not saying this about Lenin, but maybe I am, that there's people who steal ideas for the, because of ego, because of all those kinds of things. I don't think it's all that common, frankly. The Newton hook, Leibniz, Contratombs, and so on, well, you're at the beginnings of a lot of things there and so on. These are difficult and complex times as well. These are times in which science as an activity pursued by other than, let us say, interested aristocrats is becoming something somewhat different. It's not a professional community of investigators in the same way. It's also a period in which procedures and rules of practice are being developed to avoid attacking one another directly and pulling out a sword to cut off the other guy's head if he disagrees with you and so on. So it's a very different period. Controversies happen. People get angry. I can think of a number of others, including in the development of optics in the 19th century and so on. It can get hot under the collar. Sometimes one character who's worked an area extensively, whether they've come up with something terribly novel or not, and somebody else kind of moves in and does completely different and novel things, the first guy gets upset about it because he's sort of muscled into what I thought was my area. You find that sort of stuff. But do you have examples of cases where it worked out well, like that competition is good for the progress of science? Yeah, it almost always is good in that sense. Just painful for the individuals involved. Can be. It doesn't have to be nasty, although sometimes it is. So on the space, for the example of optics, could you comment on that one? Well, yeah, sure. I mean, there are several, but I could give you... All right, so I'll give you this example that probably is the most pertinent. The first polytechnic school, like MIT or Caltech, was actually founded in France during the French Revolution. It exists today. It's the Ecole Polytechnique. Two people who were there were two young men in the 90s, 1790s, named on the one hand Francois Aragaux and the other Jean-Baptiste Biot. They both lived a long time, well into the 1850s. Aragaux became a major administrator of science, and Biot's career started to peter out after about the late teens. Now they are sent on an expedition, which was one of the expeditions involving measuring things to start the metric system. There's a lot more to that story. Anyway, they come back. Aragaux gets separated. He's captured by pirates, actually. Wounds up in Tangier, escapes, is captured again. Everybody thinks he's dead. He gets back to Paris and so on. He's greeted as a hero and whatnot. In the meantime, Biot has pretty much published some of the stuff that he's done, and Aragaux doesn't get much credit for it, and Aragaux starts to get very angry. Biot is known for this kind of thing. So Aragaux, anyway, Biot starts investigating a new phenomenon in optics involving something called polarization. He writes all kinds of stuff on it. Aragaux looks into this and decides to write some things as well. Actually, Biot gets mostly interested in it when he finds out that Aragaux is doing stuff. Now Biot is actually the better scientist in a lot of ways, but Aragaux is furious about this, so furious that he actually demands and forces the leader of French science, La Place, the Marquis de La Place, and cohorts to write a note in the published journal saying, oh, excuse us, actually, Aragaux, et cetera, et cetera, blah, blah. So Aragaux continues to just hold this antipathy and fear of Biot. So what happens? In 1815, Napoleon is finished at Waterloo. A young Frenchman by the name of Augustin Fresnel, who was in the army, is going back to his home on the north coast of France in Normandy. He passes through Paris. Aragaux is friends with Fresnel's uncle, who was the head of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts at the time. Anyway, Fresnel is already interested in certain things in light, and he talks to Aragaux. Aragaux tells him a few things. Fresnel goes home, and Fresnel is a brilliant experimenter. He observes things, and he's a very good mathematician, calculates things. He writes something up. He sends it to Aragaux. Aragaux looks at it, and Aragaux says to himself, I can use this to get back at Biot. He brings Fresnel to Paris, sets him up in a room at the observatory where Aragaux is for Fresnel to continue his work, paper after paper comes out, undercutting everything Biot had done. What is it about jealousy and just envy that could be an engine of creativity and productivity versus an Einstein where it seems like not? I don't know which one is better. I guess it depends on the personality. Both are useful engines in science. In this particular story, it's maybe even more interesting because Fresnel himself, the young guy, he knew what Aragaux was doing with him, and he didn't like it. He didn't want to get with it. He wrote his brother, said, I don't want to get into an argument with Biot. I just want to do my stuff. Aragaux is using him, but it's because Aragaux kept pushing him to go into certain areas that stuff kept coming out. Ego is beautiful. Okay, but back to Newton. There's a bunch of things I want to ask, but let's say since we're on the Leibniz and the topic of drama, let me ask another drama question. Why was Newton a complicated man? We're breaking news today. This is like- Right, why was he complicated? His brain structure was different. I don't know why. He had a complicated young life, as we've said. He had always been very self-contained and solitary. He had acquaintances and friends, and when he moved to London eventually, he had quite a career, a career, for instance, that led him when he was famous by then, the 1690s. He moves to London. He becomes first warden of the mint. The mint is what produces coins, and coinage was a complicated thing because there was counterfeiting going on. He becomes master of the mint to the extent. A guy at MIT wrote a book about this a little bit. We wrote something on it too. I forget his name was Levin, that Newton sent investigators out to catch these guys and sent at least one of them, a famous one named Challener, to the gallows. One of the reasons he probably was so particularly angry at Challener was Challener had apparently said some nasty things about Newton in front of parliament at some point. Fair enough. Yeah. That was apparently not a good idea. Well, he had a bit of a temper, so Newton had a bit of a temper. Clearly, clearly. But he even, as a young man at Cambridge, though he doesn't come from wealth, he attracts people who recognize his smarts. As a young fellow named Humphrey Newton shared his rooms, these students always shared rooms with one another, became his kind of amanuenses to write down what Newton was doing and so on. There were others over time who he befriended in various ways and so on. He was solitary. He had, as far as we know, no relationships with either women or men in anything other than a formal way. The only- Those get in the way relationships. Right. Well, I mean, he was, I don't know if he was close to his mother. She passed away, everything left him. He went to be with her after she died. He was close to his niece, Catherine Barton, who basically came to run his household when he moved to London and so on. She married a man named Conduit, who became one of the people who controlled Newton's legacy later on and so on. You can even see the house that, the townhouse that Newton lived in in those days, still there. Right. So there's the story of Newton coming up with quite a few ideas during a pandemic. We're on the outskirts of a pandemic ourselves. Right. And a lot of people use that example as motivation for everybody while they're in lockdown to get stuff done. So what's that about? Can you tell the story of that? Well, I can. Let me first say that, of course, we've been teaching over Zoom lately. There was no Zoom back then? There was no Zoom back then. Although it wouldn't have made much difference because the story was Newton was so complicated in his lectures that at one point Humphrey Newton actually said that he might as well have just been lecturing to the walls because nobody was there to listen to it. So what difference? Also not a great teacher, huh? If you look at his optical notes, if that's what he's reading from- Oh boy. Okay. No. So what can you say about that whole journey through the pandemic that resulted in so much innovation in such a short amount of time? Well, I mean, there's two times that he goes home. Would he have been able to do it and do do it if he'd stayed at Cambridge? I think he would have. I don't think it really, although I do like to tell my advanced students when I lectured on the history of physics to the physics and chemistry students, especially we've been doing it over Zoom in the last year. When we get to Newton and so on, because these kids are 21, 22, I like to say, well, when Newton was your age and he had to go home during an epidemic, do you know what he produced? So can you actually summarize this for people who don't know, how old was Newton and what did he produce? Well, Newton goes up to Cambridge, as it's said, when he's 18 years old, in 1660, and the so-called Miraculous Year, the Anus Mirabilis, where you get the development in the calculus and in optical discoveries especially, is 1666. So he's what, 24 years old at the time, but judging from the notebooks that I mentioned, he's already, before that, come to an awful lot of developments over the previous couple of years. Doesn't have much to do with the fact that he twice went home. It is true that the optical experiments that we talked of a while ago with the light on the wall moving up and down were done at home. In fact, you can visit the very room he did it in to this day. So cool. Yeah, it's very cool. And if you look through the window in that room, there is an apple tree out there in the garden. So you might be wrong about this. I thought you were lying to me. Maybe there's an apple involved after all. It's not the same apple tree, but it's cuttings. How do you know? They don't last that long, but it's 400 years ago. Oh, wow, I continue with the dumbest questions. Okay, so you're saying that perhaps going home was not- It may have given him an opportunity to work things through. And after all, he did make use of that room and he could do things like put a shade over the window, move things around, cut holes in it and do stuff. Probably in his rooms at Cambridge, maybe not. Although when he stayed at Cambridge subsequently and became a fellow and then the first, actually the second Lucasian professor there. He was actually really the first one because Isaac Barrow, who was the mathematician, professor of optics who recognized Newton's genius, gave up what would have been his position because he recognized, Newton may not have learned too much from him, although they did interact. And so Newton was the first Lucasian professor really, the one that Stephen Hawking held till he died. And we know that the rooms that he had there at Cambridge subsequently, those rooms are still there. He built an all chemical furnace outside, did all sorts of stuff in those rooms. And don't forget, you didn't have to do too much as a Lucasian professor. Every so often you had to go give these lectures, whether anybody was there or not and deposit the notes for the future, which is how we have all those things. Oh, they were stored and now we have them and now we know just how terrible the teacher Newton was. Yeah, but we know how brilliant these notes are. In fact, the second volume of the notes really on the great book that he published, The Optics, which he published in 1704, that has just been finished with full annotations and analysis by the greatest analyst of Newton's optics, Alan Shapiro, who retired a few years ago at the University of Minnesota and been working on Newton's optics ever since I knew him and before and I've known him since 1976. Is there something you could say broadly about either that work on optics or Principia itself as something that I've never actually looked at as a piece of work? Is it powerful in itself or is it just an important moment in history in terms of the amount of inventions that are within, the amount of ideas that are within, or is it a really powerful work in itself? Well, it is a powerful work in itself. You can see this guy coming to grips with and pushing through and working his way around complicated and difficult issues, melding experimental situations which nobody had worked with before, even discovering new things, trying to figure out ways of putting this together with mathematical structures, succeeding and failing at the same time. And we can see him doing that. What is contained within Principia? I don't even know in terms of the scope of the work. Is it the entirety of the body of work of Newton? No, no, no, no. The Principia Mathematica is- Is it calculus? Well, all right, so the Principia is divided into three books. Excellent. Book one contains his version of the laws of motion and the application of those laws to figure out when a body moves in certain curves and is forced to move in those curves by forces directed to certain fixed points, what is the nature of the mathematical formula for those forces? That's all that book one is about. And it contains not the kind of version of the calculus that uses algebra of the sort that I was trying to explain before, but is done in terms of ratios between geometric line segments when one of the line segments goes very, very small. It's called a kind of limiting procedure, which is calculus, but it's a geometrically structured although it's clearly got algebraic elements in it as well. And that makes the Principia's mathematical structure rather hard for people who aren't studying it today to go back to. Book two contains his work on what we now call hydrostatics and a little bit about hydrodynamics, a fuller development of the concept of pressure, which is a complicated concept. And book three applies what he did in book one to the solar system. And it is successful partially because the only types of problems you can exactly solve in terms of the interactions of two particles governed by gravitational force between them is for only two bodies. If there's more than two, let's say it's A, B, and C. A acts on B, B acts on C, C acts on A. You cannot solve it exactly. You have to develop techniques. The fullest sets of techniques are really only developed about 30 or 40 years after Newton's death by French mathematicians like Laplace. Newton tried to apply his structure to the sun, earth, moon, because the moon's motion is very complicated. The moon, for instance, exactly repeats its observable position among the stars only every 19 years. That is, if you look up where the moon is among the stars at certain times and it changes, it's complicated. By the way, that was discovered by the Babylonians. That fact, the 19 years. Thousands of years ago, yes. And then you have that little piece of data and how do you make sense of it? You mean that that is data and you have to- And it's complicated. So Newton actually kind of reverse engineered a technique that had been developed by a man named Horrocks using certain laws of Kepler's to try and get around this thing. And Newton then sort of, my understanding, I've never studied this, has reversed it and fit it together with his force calculations by way of an approximation. And was able to construct a model to make some predictions? It fit things backwards pretty well. Okay. Where does data fit into this? We kind of earlier in the discussion mentioned data as part of the scientific method. How important was data to Newton? So like you mentioned Prisman playing with it and looking at stuff and then coming up with calculations and so on. Where does data fit into any of his ideas? All right. Well, let me say two things first. One, we rarely use the phrase scientific method anymore because there is no one easily describable such method. I mean, humans have been playing around with the world and learning how to repetitively do things and make things happen ever since humans became humans. Do you have a preferred definition of the scientific method? What are the various- No, I don't. I prefer to talk about the considered manipulation of artificial structures to produce results that can be worked together with schemes to construct other devices and make predictions, if you will, about the way such things will work. So ultimately it's about producing other devices. It's like leads you down- I think so principally. I mean you may have data, if you will, like astronomical data obtained otherwise and so on, but yes. But number two here is this question of data. What is data in that sense? See, when we talk about data today, we have a kind of complex notion which reverts to even issues of statistics and measurement procedures and so on. So let me put it to you this way. So let's say I had a ruler in front of me. Go on. I marked off in little black marks separated by let's say distances called a millimeter. Now I make a mark on this piece of paper here. So I made a nice black mark. And I ask you, I want you to measure that and tell me how long it is. You're going to take the ruler. You're going to put it next to it. And you're going to look. And it's not going to sit, even if you put one end as close as you can on one black mark, the other end probably isn't going to be exactly on a black mark. Well, you'll say it's closer to this or that. You'll write down a number. And I say, okay, take the ruler away a minute. I take this away. Come back in five minutes. Put the piece of paper down. Do it again. You're going to probably come up with a different number. And you're going to do that a lot of times. And then if I tell you, I want you to give me your best estimate of what the actual length of that thing is, what are you going to do? You're going to average all of these numbers? Why? Statistics. Well, yes, statistics. There's lots of ways of going around it, but the average is the best estimate on the basis of what's called the central limit theorem, a statistical theorem. You're talking about things that were not really developed until the 1750s, 60s, and 70s. Newton died in 1727. The intuition perhaps was there. Not really. I'll tell you what people did, including Newton, although Newton is partially the one exception. We talked a while ago about this guy, Christian Huygens. He measured lots of things, and he was a good mechanic himself. He and his brother, ground lenses. Huygens, I told you, developed the first pendulum mechanism, pendulum driven clock with a mechanism and so on. Also a spring watch where he got into a controversy with Hook over that, by the way. What's with these mechanics and the controversy? Well we also have Huygens' notes. They're preserved at Leiden University in Holland, he's Dutch, for his work in optics, which was extensive. We don't have time to go into that except the following. Number of years ago, I went through those things because in this optical theory that he had, there are four numbers that you've got to be able to get good numbers on to be able to predict other things. What would we do today? What in fact was done at the end of the 18th century when somebody went back to this? You do what I told you to do with the ruler. You make a lot of measurements and average results. We have Huygens' notes. He did make a lot of measurements, one after the other after the other. But when he came to use the numbers for calculations, and indeed when he published things at the end of his life, he gives you one number and it's not the average of any of them. It's just one of them. Which one was it? The one that he thought he got so good at working by practice that he put down the one he was most confident in. That was the general procedure at the time. You wouldn't publish a paper in which you wrote down six numbers and said, well I'd measured this six times, let me put them together. None of them is really, they would have said, the right number, but I'll put them together and give you a good number. No, you would have been thought of that, you don't know what you're doing. By the way, there's just an inkling of value to that approach. Just an inkling. We sometimes use statistics as a thing that solves all the problems. We'll just do a lot of it and we'll take the average or whatever it is, as many excellent books on mathematics have highlighted the flaws in our approach to certain sciences that rely heavily on statistics. Let me ask you again for a friend about this alchemy thing. It'd be nice to create gold, but it also seems to come into play quite a bit throughout the history of science, perhaps in positive ways in terms of its impact. Can you say something to the history of alchemy and its impact? A little bit, sure. It used to be thought two things. One that alchemy, which dates certainly back to the Islamic period in Islam, you're talking 11th, 12th, 13th centuries among Islamic natural philosophers and experimenters. It used to be thought that alchemy, which picked up strikingly in the 15th, 16th century, 1500s and thereabouts, was a mystical procedure involving all sorts of strange notions and so on. That's not entirely untrue, but it is substantially untrue in that alchemists were engaged in what was known as chrysopoia, that is looking for ways to transform invaluable materials into valuable ones. But in the process of doing so or attempting to do so, they learned how to create complex amalgams of various kinds. They used very elaborate apparatus, glass, alembics, in which they would use heat to produce chemical decompositions. They would write down and observe these compositions. Many of the so-called really strange looking alchemical formulas and statements where they'll say something like, I can't produce it, but it'll be better. The soul of Mars will combine with this, et cetera, et cetera. It has been shown are almost all actual formulas for how to engage in the production of complex amalgams and what to do. By the time of Newton, Newton was reading the works of a fellow by the name of Starkey, who actually came from Harvard shortly before, in which things had progressed, if you will, to the point where the procedure turns into what historians call chrysopoia, which basically runs into the notion of thinking that these things are made out of particles. This is the mechanical philosophy. Can we engage in processes, chemical processes, to rearrange these things, which is not so stupid after all. We do it, except we happen to do it in reactors, not in chemical processes, unless of course it had happened that cold fusion had worked, which it didn't. Not yet. Well, right. But so that's the way they're thinking about these things. There's a kind of mix. And Newton engages extensively in those sorts of manipulations. In fact, more in that than almost anything else, except for his optical investigations. If you look through the latter parts of the 1670s, the last five, six, seven years or so of that, there's more on that than there is on anything else. He's not working on mechanics. He's pretty much gone pretty far in optics. He'll turn back to optics later on. So optics and alchemy. So what you're saying is Isaac Newton liked shiny things. Well, actually, if you go online and look at what Bill Newman, the professor at Bloomington, Indiana, has produced, you'll find the very shiny thing called the star regulus, which Newton describes as having produced according to a particular way, which Newman figured out and was able to do it. And it's very shiny. There you go. Proves the theorem. Can I ask you about God, religion, and its role in Newton's life? Was there helpful, constructive or destructive influences of religion in his work and in his life? Well, there you begin to touch on a complex question. The role that God played would be an interesting question to answer, should one go and be able to speak with this invisible character who doesn't exist? But putting that aside for the moment. Yeah, we don't like to talk about others while they're not here. Right. Newton is a deeply religious man, not unusually so, of course, for the time. Clearly his upbringing and perhaps his early experiences have exacerbated that in a number of ways. He takes a lot of things personally and he finds perhaps solace in thinking about a sort of governing abstract rulemaking exacting deity. I think there is little question that his conviction that you can figure things out has a fair bit to do with his profound belief that this rulemaker doesn't do things arbitrarily. Newton does not think that miracles have happened since maybe the time of Christ, if then and not in the same way. He was, for instance, an anti-trinitarian. He did not hold that Christ had a divine being, but was rather endowed with certain powers by the rulemaker and whatnot. He did not think that some of the tales of the Old Testament with various miracles and so on occurred in anything like that way. Some may have, some may not have, like everybody else. Of course, he did think that creation had happened about 6,000 years ago. Wait, really? Oh, yeah, sure. Well, biblical chronology can give you a little bit about that. It's a little controversial, but sure. Interesting. Wow. He created the universe 6,000 years ago. That didn't interfere with his playing around with the sun and the moon and the- Oh, no, because he's figuring out, he's watching the brilliant construction that this perfect entity- Did 6,000 years ago. Yeah, has produced- Plus or minus a few years. Well, if you go with Bishop Oster, it's 4004 BCE. Want to be precise about it. This is a serious program. We always want to be precise. Okay, let me ask another ridiculous question. If Newton were to travel forward in time and visit with Einstein and have a discussion about space, time, and general relativity, that conception of time, that conception of gravity, what do you think that discussion will go? Put that way, I think Newton would sit there in shock and say, I have no idea what you're talking about. If on the other hand, there's a time machine, you go back and bring a somewhat younger Newton, not a man my age, say. He lived a long time into his mid-80s, but take him when he's in his 40s, let's say. Bring him forward and don't immediately introduce him to Einstein. Let's take him for a ride on a railroad. Let him experience the railroad. Oh, that's right. Take him around and show him a sparking machine. He knows about sparks. Fending off sparks. Show him wires. Have him touch the wires and get a little shock. Show him a clicking telegraph machine of the kind. Then let him hear the clicks in a telephone receiver and so on. Do that for a couple of months. Let him get accustomed to things. Then take him into, not Einstein yet, let's say we're taking him into the 1890s. Einstein is a young man then. We take him into some of the laboratories. We show him some of the equipment, the devices, not the most elaborate ones. We show him certain things. We educate him bit by bit. The optics, maybe focus on that. Certainly on optics. You begin to show him things. He's a brilliant human being. I think bit by bit he would begin to see what's going on. But if you just dumped him in front of Einstein, he'd sit there his eyes would glaze over. I guess it's almost a question of how big of a leap, how many leaps have been taken in science that go from Newton to Einstein? We sometimes in a compressed version of history think that not much. Oh, that's totally wrong. A lot. Huge amounts. In multifarious ways involving fundamental conceptions, mathematical structures, the evolution of novel experimentation and devices, the organization. It's not everything. Everything. I mean, to a point where I wonder even if Newton was like, you said 40, but even like 30. So he's very, like if you would be able to catch up with the conception of everything. I wonder as a scientist, how much you load in from age five about this world in order to be able to conceive of the world of ideas that push that science forward. I mean, you mentioned the railroad and all those kinds of things. That might be fundamental to our ability to invent even when it doesn't directly obviously seem relevant. Well, yes. I mean, the railroad, the steam engine, the watt engine, et cetera. I mean, that was really the watt engine was developed pretty, although what new Joseph Black, a chemist, scientist, so on, did stuff on heat, was developed pretty much independently of the developing thoughts about heat at the time, but what it's not independent of is the evolution of practice in the manufacture and construction of devices, which can do things in extraordinarily novel ways and the premium being gradually placed on calculating how you can make them more efficient. That is of a piece with a way of thinking about the world in which you're controlling things and working it. It's something that humans have been doing for a long time, but in this more concerted and structured way, I think you really don't find it in the fullest sense until well into the 1500s and really not fully until the 17th century later on. So Newton had this year of miracles. I wonder if I could ask you briefly about Einstein and his year of miracles. I've been reading, re-reading, revisiting the brilliance of the papers that Einstein published in the year 1905, one of which, one of the Nobel Prize, the photoelectric effect, but also Brownian motion, special theory of relativity, and of course the old E equals MC squared. Does that make sense to you that these two figures had such productive years that there's this moment of genius? Maybe if we zoom out, I mean, my work is very much in artificial intelligence, sort of wondering about the nature of intelligence. How did evolution on earth produce genius that could come up with so much in so little time? To me, that gives me hope that one person can change the world in such a small amount of time. Well, of course there are precedents in both Newton's and Einstein's cases for elements of what we're finding there and so on. Well, I have no idea. You know, I'm sure you must have read, it was kind of a famous story that after Einstein died, he donated his brain and they sliced it up to see if they could find something unusual there and nothing unusual visibly in there. So clearly there are people who for various reasons, maybe both intrinsic and extrinsic in the sense of experience and so on, are capable of coming up with these extraordinary results. Many years ago when I was a student, a friend of mine came in and said, did you read this? I forget what it was. Anyway, there was a story in the paper. It was about, I think it was a young woman who was, she couldn't speak and she was somewhere on the autism spectrum. She could not read other people's affect in any ways, but she could sit down at a piano and having heard it once and then run variations on the most complex pianistic works of Chopin and others. Right? Now, how? Some aspect of our mind is able to tune in and some aspect of reality and become a master of it. And every once in a while that means coming up with breakthrough ideas in physics. Yeah. How the heck does that happen? Who knows? Jed, I'd like to say thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today. It was a really fascinating conversation. I've learned so much about Isaac Newton, who is one of the most fascinating figures in human history. So thank you so much for talking to me. A pleasure. I enjoyed it very much. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jed Buchwald. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Thomas Kuhn, a philosopher of science. The answers you get depend on the questions you ask. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.","label":1}
{"text":"When dusk falls and the city sleeps, I awake.\n\nThe steps beckon, so I descend to the depths of the subway. I\u2019m a night-creature: unshaven, red-eyed, and dishevelled. Fast-food bag remnants flutter past, and fresh chewing-gum adorns the stone.\n\nI tread the cold platform; feeble lights shine off dirty tiled walls. Buzzing fluorescence permeates my consciousness, and a nearby light flickers: once, twice, then dies.\n\nThe edge calls, and I sit, dangling my legs, ignoring the petulant white line. Warm, fusty wind blows in my face from the tunnel. Fresh air that isn\u2019t fresh. An imitation \u2014 like my life.\n\nThe hush hangs heavy, discarded fries and scattered newspaper my only companions. I squint in the sickly light, nausea building in me from that off-white glare.\n\nA disembodied voice announces the next train. They run through the night, not caring if anyone alights. Perhaps they run for the ghosts and demons: the unseen visitors who taunt me and tell me not to move.\n\nI can\u2019t put the thought away. If I stay, the train will crush my legs. Pain may bring me clarity.\n\nBut I\u2019m not ready for that yet. I want to see her one more time.\n\nI scramble up, the clanking carriages loud in the platform\u2019s silence. The doors grind open, and the mechanical voice above states the destination. Jumping on the empty carriage, I could be the last human being left, traversing in a world that keeps going without us.\n\nI sit on a plastic chair. The clatter of the rails invades my thoughts, and the white noise fills my mind. Station walls turn to black tunnels, and I\u2019m alone, in a tube, the train\u2019s engines blanking everything else out. I sway to the rhythm, losing myself in its perpetuity.\n\nWe pull up at the next station where three lines meet. Empty platforms stare back at me, separated by tracks lying in black dips.\n\nI press my nose to the window, hoping to catch a glimpse of her. This moment, when I am between waking and sleeping, she sometimes appears.\n\nA train rushes in from the opposite direction. I peer forward, hands shaking as I grasp the cold metal pole.\n\nShe travels the lines, too, and we always cross paths and never meet. I wonder if she looks for me, or if her ghostly journey dooms her to retread her final moments.\n\nThe other train pulls out. My heart quickens, and I clench my fist around the pole.\n\nThere she is, standing on the edge of the platform, in glorious technicolour. She is the real one, and I am the dream. My eyes fall into long exposure, as I gaze on her yellow hair, her blue dress, her neat shoes.\n\nI can never shake that image. It reinforces the burn in my brain. And I never want that burn to heal.\n\nMy train accelerates, and I stretch to catch a final glimpse.\n\nWhen she is gone, I slump in my seat and give myself up to the white noise.\n\nI reach the end of the line, an overground station, and sit on the cold steel bench in the grey dawn. Icy metal on the back of my legs chills my body. The empty station platform infuses me with leftover energies of those who walk its slabs daily. I do not feel anything of my own; I\u2019m only sustained by the memories of those who have walked before.\n\nI cannot follow her; I lack the courage.

I didn\u2019t feel the excitement I thought I\u2019d feel by purchasing a new vehicle.\n\nFor most, this is one of the biggest purchases we will make in our lifetime, and as so, generally, the excitement phase\/period of euphoria will last at least about a month.\n\nNot for me.\n\nImmediately, that night I began to question the decision I made, and I asked myself? Why the hell did you just go by a $40,000 dollar vehicle and put the damn downpayment for the vehicle on a credit card?\n\nVoices of my father lecturing me like Rich Dad began to echo in my head as the first rationalization I came to realize at that moment hit me. I was broke.\n\nHowever, despite me knowing that, my desire to gain guided the decision process in purchasing a vehicle.\n\nWhile at the dealership, I fixated myself and imagined how much utility and fun I could have in my new truck doing everything from picking up furniture for my family to enjoying the offroad mud trails.\n\nI fell into the exact trap car salespeople want you to slide into.\n\nOnly now do I realize there is nothing wrong with desiring to have more than what you may currently have.\n\nBut, it\u2019s important to be able to know how to properly restrain that desire so that you are able to delay gratification and pay for things only when you have the money to purchase them outright.\n\nThis is an attribute of personal finances that, unfortunately, keeps so many people in the rat race.\n\nAnd so, I learned to:\n\nOnly purchase consumer items once you have the ability to pay for them in full.\n\nA New Financial Low Inspired Change In me\n\nIf there\u2019s ever been a point in my life where I just felt a strong intrinsic desire to change myself; The day I came home from purchasing my vehicle was the day I knew I couldn\u2019t continue down the path I was on.\n\nI began investing time in broadening my financial literacy and understanding.\n\nAnd yes, I was raised in a household with two certified public accounts, where I was taught about the value of maintaining credit, paying your bills, and balancing a budget.\n\nStill, I felt like I need to expand my horizons even more.\n\nSo, I began with a Google search on personal finances and budgeting, and I read\/bookmarked every worthwhile article I could on those topics.\n\nLater, I purchased best-selling author Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s famous book, Rich Dad Poor Dad, and I found it to be a remarkable read on personal finances.\n\nI was seeking to become an expert in the field of personal finances for my own benefit, and in the process, I realized, first, there is a shortage of young people who understand finances, and two, there is a lot of bad information on the internet as well.\n\nSo, I set my life\u2019s mission, goal, and purpose to help young people create a brighter future financially and otherwise.\n\nThe takeaway is this: Through my darkest hour, I found my greatest passion.\n\nMaterial Possessions Cannot Make Us Happy, In fact, the opposite can happen.\n\nLearning this about myself also brought about another self-actualization moment in my life.\n\nMaterial possessions cannot make you truly happy.\n\nThe credit card I used for my downpayment was a card that I just received in the mail. As you know, to bait you into using it for spending, I was granted an introductory no-interest period for 9 months.\n\nIn my mind, I figured what the hell? I can pay my downpayment off way before the 9 months no interest period is up. No harm, no foul, right?\n\nReflecting on this made me come to the understanding that my financial literacy was severely lacking, and my financial decisions were going to lead me down a path where I would never have anything worth having.\n\nSo at once, here I was, on the brink of turning 22 years old. $40,000 dollars worth of auto loan debt and $2000 dollars worth of credit card debt and hardly any way to pay for it.\n\nI was driving the vehicle I thought would be the pinnacle turning point of my life. The decision I thought would make everything better.\n\nBut, in the opposite fashion. It made everything worse.\n\nIn truth, it\u2019s a scary feeling to have when you know that you have financial obligations; however, you possess no means to pay for them.\n\nFor days after the purchase, I began to psyche myself out over how I would make the monthly payments and pay the credit card debt off.\n\nSuppose any of you have been here. You know finances can bring a huge amount of stress to one\u2019s life, and let me tell yall.\n\nStress can kill you.\n\nBut, here\u2019s the kicker.\n\nI learned:\n\nStress, in any form, comes from making bad life decisions.\n\nIf you analyze any of the stressors in your life and sincerely question the source of those stressors. What you more likely will find is a bad decision that was made on your behalf.\n\nIn the case of me, my decision to purchase a $40,000 vehicle led to the anxiety and frustration that came later.\n\nIt\u2019s okay, though, because nobody is perfect. But we\u2019ve got to own our mistakes, learn from them, and do better.\n\nI\u2019ve seen news stories of people taking their own lives because of the financial stress they have allowed to overwhelm them.\n\nWe only get to live one life.

{"text":"Stochastic Inflation in Compact Extra Dimensions\n\nWhile moving down the potential on its classical slow roll trajectory, the inflaton field is subject to quantum jumps, which take it up or down the potential at random. In\"stochastic inflation\", the impact of these quantum jumps is modeled by smoothing out the field over (at least) Hubble-patch sized domains and treating fluctuations on smaller scales as noise. The inflaton thus becomes a stochastic process whose values at a given time are calculated using its probability distribution. We generalize this approach for non-canonic kinetic terms of Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) type and investigate the resulting modifications of the field's trajectory. Since models of DBI inflation arise from string-inspired scenarios in which the scalar field has a geometric interpretation, we insist that field value restrictions imposed by the model's string origin must be respected at the quantum level.\n\n\nIntroduction\nRecent advances in string theory have lead to the construction of explicit models of inflation in which the scalar field \u03c6 is, for example, associated with the position of a (p + 1)-dimensional hypersurface (a so-called Dp-brane) embedded into the ten-dimensional string background spacetime [1]. For p = 3, the brane's world volume corresponds to our four-dimensional Universe, while the six extra dimensions are compactified on a suitable internal manifold [2]. It is hoped that string theory can bring us closer to establishing inflation's theoretical foundations, while the cosmological parameters derived from \"brane inflation\" may be the only potentially observable consequences of string theory for decades to come. Due to the D3's Dirac Born Infeld (DBI) kinetic term, these models provide a \"stringy\" realization of k-inflation [3], giving rise to a rich and non-standard phenomenology.\nWhile inflationary predictions for the properties of the cosmic microwave background evidently apply inside our observable patch of the Universe, the stochastic approach to inflation [4] seeks to understand the behavior of the quantum inflaton field on much larger scales. In this work [5], we extend the stochastic treatment applied to standard inflation in Refs. [6,7] to DBI scenarios. There, the impact of the inflaton's stochastic character on scales beyond the Hubble patch was (in the Gaussian approximation) entirely expressed in terms of integrals of the Hubble parameter H(\u03c6) and its derivatives. Here, we find that the influence of the modified kinetic term is readily absorbed into the same formalism if the so-called Lorentz factor \u03b3(\u03c6) [8], which measures the dynamics' deviation from the usual\u03c6 2 \/2 (with \u03b3 \u2248 1 in the standard and \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e in the \"ultrarelativistic\" case), is treated on an equal footing with H(\u03c6).\n\nStochastic inflation 2.1. The standard case\nThe notion of the inflaton as a stochastic process \u03d5[\u03be] arises as follows: the field \u03c6(x, t) is coarsegrained on a given (large) scale L, meaning that a spatially smooth field \u03d5(t) is constructed from \u03c6's long-wavelength Fourier modes only, while fluctuations \u03b4\u03c6(x, t) on smaller scales are interpreted as stochastic \"noise\". Explicitly, this decomposition reads where L \u22121 = \u03b5aH with \u03b5 a small parameter. The smoothed \u03d5(t) then obeys a Langevin-type equation, which is obtained from the slow-roll 1 Friedmann and Klein Gordon equations plus a noise term \u03be(t) due to the small-scale fluctuations (a prime denotes \u03d5-derivatives), In Ref. [6], this equation was solved using a perturbative expansion in the noise, i.e. by writing By sorting the resulting terms on both sides of Eq. (2) by orders of \u03be, evolution equations for \u03b4\u03d5 1 and \u03b4\u03d5 2 are identified, which can be solved by a time integration of H, its \u03d5-derivatives and the noise. While the explicit time-dependence of \u03be(t) is unknown, its stochastic properties (2) can be used to obtain the mean values \u03d5 2 1 and \u03d5 2 in terms of \u03d5-space integrals of H, H \u2032 etc. only. These mean values enter into the probability density function (PDF) P c (\u03d5) = \u03b4(\u03d5 \u2212 \u03d5[\u03be]) , which describes the probability for the stochastic process \u03d5[\u03be] to assume a given value \u03d5 at time t inside a single coarse-grained domain. In the Gaussian approximation, one has where \u03d5 cl is the inflaton's value on the classical slow-roll trajectory. Hence, since \u03d5 2 1 and \u03d5 2 are functions of \u03d5 cl (and the initial field value \u03d5 in at the onset of inflation), one can use them to calculate the quantum-corrected mean \u03d5 = \u03d5 cl + \u03b4\u03d5 2 along with the standard deviation. Ref. [6] carried out this calculation for several model classes, illustrating how quantum jumps significantly modify the classical trajectory in some cases.\nLet us add two further remarks: first, the PDF of Eq. (3) considers \u03d5[\u03be] inside one L 3 volume. However, since L \u221d aH itself depends on the inflaton's classical value inside it, different domains should be \"weighted\" with respect to their size. This is achieved by calculating a volumecorrected distribution P v (\u03d5), which gives a \u03d5 v = \u03d5 [6]. Second, the perturbative expansion evidently only holds if the noise-induced corrections become smaller and smaller at higher orders in \u03be. In Ref. [7], this condition was quantified and used as an intrinsic criterion for the regime of validity of the above ansatz.\n\nThe DBI case\nWe showed [5] that the results of Refs. [6,7] are straightforwardly generalized to the case of string-inspired DBI inflation, provided the coarse-graining scale in Eq. (1) is adapted and the DBI Langevin equation is used. It can be shown that the DBI analogue of Eq. (2) is obtained by replacing H \u2032 \u2192 H \u2032 \/\u03b3 in the classical drift term 2 , where the Lorentz factor is given by \u03b3(\u03d5) = 1 + 4H \u20322 \/(\u03ba 2 T ) 1\/2 . (For the DBI domain size, one has L \u22121 DBI = \u03b5a\u03b3H.) Here, the so-called warping function T (\u03d5) -like the potential V (\u03d5)-is a priori a free function but in a concrete model of brane inflation, both V and T are derived from the 10d string background [1,2]. Using the same perturbative expansion in \u03be, one can again solve for \u03b4\u03d5 2 1 and \u03b4\u03d5 2 in terms of integrals along \u03d5's (DBI-)classical trajectory, which read respectively. [The results of Ref. [6] are reproduced for \u03b3 \u2261 1 in Eqs. (4,5).] Evidently, the only input needed to carry out the integral (4) are the potential and the warping, which (in the slow-roll limit) completely determine H and \u03b3. In Ref. [5], we considered several examples, but here we focus on the case of \"UV brane inflation\" (see below) with V (\u03d5) = V 0 + (m 2 \/2)\u03d5 2 and T (\u03d5) = \u03d5 4 \/\u03bb. In the limit where the constant V 0 dominates, Eq. (4) can be integrated (taking on board that \u03d5 < m Pl always, a consequence of the string-geometric background [9]), giving where \u03b1 \u2261 12\u03c0m 2 Pl \/(\u03bbm 2 ) and \u03b2 \u2261 V 0 \/(m 2 m 2 Pl ) are parameter combinations. The definition of the inflaton's Gaussian PDF (3) remains unchanged in the DBI case. Hence, for a given \u03b1, \u03b2, m and \u03d5 in , Eqs. (6) give the mean \u03d5 = \u03d5 cl + \u03b4\u03d5 2 for any \u03d5 cl on the DBI slow-roll trajectory.\n\nGeometric consistency in compact extra dimensions\nIn the 10d string theory picture, the scenario of UV brane inflation corresponds to a D3-brane inside a 6d \"warped throat\" (i.e. cone-shaped) geometry, where a radial direction r extends above a 5d angular base. Up to renormalization, the D3's position along r is the inflaton, which therefore has a limited range \u03c6 \u2208 [\u03c6 0 , \u03c6 UV ], with \u03c6 0 the \"tip\" of the cone and \u03c6 UV at its base (where it is joined onto a more complicated compact 6d geometry). Classically, the inflaton value \u03d5 cl in this scenario decreases during inflation (i.e. the D3 starts out close to the UV end of the throat, moving towards the tip). What, however, follows for the quantum-corrected \u03d5 ? According to Eq. (6), \u03b4\u03d5 2 is negative and since \u03d5 = \u03d5 cl + \u03b4\u03d5 2 , this bears the imminent risk of \u03d5 decreasing below \u03c6 0 . Translated back into the D3's r-coordinate, the quantum jumps hence seem to take the brane \"outside of spacetime\". While a similar effect was observed in Ref. [6], where the inflaton developed a non-zero probability for negative field values under the influence of the noise, the geometric origin of a stringy inflaton renders the issue far more severe.\nAs advocated in Ref. [5], this problem is avoided if reflecting or absorbing walls are installed at certain positions in \u03d5-space. While Ref. [10] considered the case of one reflecting wall, we derived the PDF for a stochastic (DBI or standard) inflaton field between two absorbing walls at \u03c6 0 and \u03c6 UV . (For UV brane inflation, this is interpreted as the D3 being \"trapped\" inside the warped throat.) To this end, we repeatedly applied the familiar method of images from electrodynamics, introducing an infinite number of \"image branes\" of alternating charge. The final PDF for this configuration is P w (\u03d5) = 2\u03c0 \u03b4\u03d5 2 1 \u22121\/2P (\u03d5), wher\u1ebd with \u03c6 m = \u03d5 the former mean found with the \"no walls\" PDF (3). The true mean field value in the presence of the walls then is \u03d5 w \u221d d\u03d5 P w (\u03d5) \u03d5 and was calculated in Ref. [5]. Interestingly, it shows oscillatory behavior, as illustrated by the example of Fig. 1. As the inflaton approaches the throat's tip, it seems that \u03d5 w stabilizes at a position above \u03c6 0 . There is, however, potential concern about the validity of the perturbative approach.\n\nConclusions\nIn brane inflation, the scalar field \u03c6 corresponds to the position of a D-brane within the 6d compact string geometry. On the one hand, this enriches the inflationary phenomenology due to the brane's non-standard kinetic term. On the other hand, the inflaton's ten-dimensional origin leaves a geometric legacy to the four-dimensional effective theory: the values of \u03c6 should respect the field space limitations imposed by the finite size of the extra dimensions. Here, we generalized several results of stochastic inflation to DBI dynamics: where, in the standard case, integrals of H(\u03c6) (and derivatives) were sufficient, the DBI case is described accurately only if the Lorentz factor \u03b3(\u03c6) is included alongside H(\u03c6). We obtained the Gaussian probability distribution function P c (\u03d5) for the smoothed-out field \u03d5, which allowed us to calculate the (second order noise-corrected) mean field value \u03d5 to be compared with the classical one \u03d5 cl . We then argued that, to avoid conflict with the underlying 10d string theory picture, even the quantum jumps superimposed on the inflaton's DBI trajectory should not take \u03d5 out of the geometrically admitted range. We proposed to implement this restriction by using suitable PDF boundary conditions in field space, i.e. by installing walls where the compact dimension associated with \u03d5 \"ends\". As an example, we considered a quadratic inflaton potential together with a quartic warping and imposed absorbing boundary conditions at both ends of the (radial direction of the) extra dimensions. As seen in Fig. 1, the trajectory then changes significantly for a chosen parameter set. Our hope is that, as the shape of the warping and the potential are better understood from string theory, these results may shed light on the possibly complicated path of the brane (that is, the inflaton) inside the six-dimensional compact space.","label":0}

{"text":"Zika fever: our newest dread disease. What is it? Where'd it come from? What do we do about it? Well for most adults, it's a relatively mild disease \u2014 a little fever, a little headache, joint pain, maybe a rash. In fact, most people who get it don't even know they've had it. But the more we find out about the Zika virus the more terrifying it becomes. For example, doctors have noticed an uptick of something called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in recent outbreaks. In Guillain-Barr\u00e9, your immune system attacks your nerve cells it can partially or even totally paralyze you. Fortunately, that's quite rare, and most people recover. But if you're pregnant when you're infected you're at risk of something terrible. Indeed, a child with a deformed head. Here's a normal baby. Here's that infant with what's called microcephaly. a brain in a head that's too small. And there's no known cure. It was actually doctors in northeastern Brazil who first noticed, just a year ago, after a Zika outbreak, that there was a peak in the incidence of microcephaly. It took medical doctors another year to be sure that it was caused by the Zika virus, but they're now sure. And if you're a \"bring on the evidence\" type, check out this publication. So where did it come from, and how did it get here? And it is here. Like many of our viruses, it came out of Africa, specifically the Zika forest in Uganda. Researchers at the nearby Yellow Fever Research Institute identified an unknown virus in a monkey in the Zika forest which is how it got its name. The first human cases of Zika fever surfaced a few years later in Uganda-Tanzania. The virus then spread through West Africa and east through equatorial Asia \u2014 Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Indonesia. But it was still mostly in monkeys and, of course, mosquitoes. In fact in the 60 years between the time it was first identified in 1947 and 2007 there were only 13 reported cases of human Zika fever. And then something extraordinary happened on the tiny Micronesian Yap islands. There was an outbreak that affected fully 75 percent of the population. How did it get there? By air. Today we have two billion commercial airline passengers. An infected passenger can board a plane, fly halfway around the world before developing symptoms \u2014 if they develop symptoms at all. Then when they land, the local mosquitoes begin to bite them and spread the fever. Zika fever then next surfaced in 2013 in French Polynesia. By December of that year, it was being transmitted locally by the mosquitoes. That led to an explosive outbreak in which almost 30,000 people were affected. From there it radiated around the Pacific. There were outbreaks in the Cook Islands, in New Caledonia, in Vanuatu, in the Solomon Islands and almost all the way around to the coast of South America and Easter Island. And then, in early 2015, there was an upsurge of cases of a dengue-like syndrome in the city of Natal in northeastern Brazil. The virus wasn't dengue, it was Zika, and it spread rapidly \u2014 Recife down the coast, a big metropolitan center, soon became the epicenter. Well people have speculated that it was 2014 World Cup soccer fans that brought the virus into the country. But others have speculated that perhaps it was Pacific Islanders participating in championship canoe races that were held in Rio that year that brought it in. Well today, this is only a year later. The virus is being locally transmitted by mosquitoes virtually throughout South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean Islands Until this year, the many thousands of cases that have been diagnosed in the US were contracted elsewhere. But as of this summer, it's being transmitted locally in Miami. It's here. So what do we do about it? Well, preventing infection is either about protecting people or about eliminating the mosquitoes. Let's focus on people first. You can get vaccinated. You can not travel to Zika areas. Or you can cover up and apply insect repellent. Getting vaccinated is not an option, because there isn't a vaccine yet and there probably won't be for a couple of years. Staying home isn't a foolproof protection either because we now know that it can be sexually transmitted. Covering up and applying insect repellent does work ... until you forget. (Laughter) So that leaves the mosquitoes, and here's how we control them now: spraying insecticides. The protective gear is necessary because these are toxic chemicals that kill people as well as bugs. Although it does take quite a lot more to kill a person than to kill a bug. These are pictures from Brazil and Nicaragua. But it looks the same in Miami, Florida. And we of course can spray insecticides from planes. Last summer, mosquito control officials in Dorchester County, South Carolina, authorized spraying of Naled, an insecticide, early one morning, as recommended by the manufacturer. Later that day, a beekeeper told reporters that her bee yard looked like it had been nuked. Oops. Bees are the good guys. The citizens of Florida protested, but spraying continued. Unfortunately, so did the increase in the number of Zika fever cases. That's because insecticides aren't very effective. So are there any approaches that are perhaps more effective than spraying but with less downsides than toxic chemicals? I'm a huge fan of biological controls, and I share that view with Rachel Carson, author of \"Silent Spring,\" the book that is credited with starting the environmental movement. In this book she tells the story, as an example, of how a very nasty insect pest of livestock was eliminated in the last century. No one knows that extraordinary story today. So Jack Block and I, when we were writing an editorial about the mosquito problem today, retold that story. And in capsule form, it's that pupae \u2014 that's the immature form of the insect \u2014 were irradiated until they were sterile, grown to adulthood and then released from planes all over the Southwest, the Southeast and down into Mexico and into Central America literally by the hundreds of millions from little airplanes, eventually eliminating that terrible insect pest for most of the Western Hemisphere. Our real purpose in writing this editorial was to introduce readers to how we can do that today \u2014 not with radiation but with our knowledge of genetics. Let me explain. This is the bad guy: Aedes aegypti. It's the most common insect vector of diseases, not just Zika but dengue, Chikungunya, West Nile virus and that ancient plague, yellow fever. It's an urban mosquito, and it's the female that does the dirty work. She bites to get a blood meal to feed her offspring. Males don't bite; they don't even have the mouth parts to bite. A little British company called Oxitec genetically modified that mosquito so that when it mates with a wild female, its eggs don't develop to adulthood. Let me show you. This is the normal reproductive cycle. Oxitec designed the mosquito so that when the male mates with the wild female the eggs don't develop. Sounds impossible? Well let me show you just diagrammatically how they do it. Now this represents the nucleus of a mosquito cell, and that tangle in the middle represents its genome, the sum total of its genes. Scientists added a single gene that codes for a protein represented by this orange ball that feeds back on itself to keep cranking out more of that protein. The extra copies, however, go and gum up the mosquitoes' genes, killing the organism. To keep it alive in the laboratory they use a compound called tetracycline. Tetracycline shuts off that gene and allows normal development. They added another little wrinkle so that they could study what happens. And that is they added a gene that makes the insect glow under UV light so that when they released it they could follow exactly how far it went how long it lived and all of the kinds of data for a good scientific study. Now this is the pupal stage, and at this stage the females are larger than the males. That allows them to sort them into the males and the females and they allow only the males to grow to adulthood. And let me remind you that males don't bite. From there it's pretty simple. They take beakers full of male mosquitoes, load them into milk cartons, and drive around the city, releasing them guided by GPS. Here's the mayor of a city releasing the first batch of what they call the \"friendly Aedes.\" Now I wish I could tell you this is an American city, but it's not. It's Piracicaba, Brazil. The amazing thing is that in just a year it brought down the cases of dengue by 91 percent. That's better than any insecticide spraying can do. So why aren't we using this remarkable biological control in the US? That's because it's a GMO: a genetically modified organism. Notice the subtitle here says if the FDA would let them they could do the same thing here, when Zika arrives. And of course it has arrived. So now I have to tell you the short form of the long, torturous story of GM regulation in the US In the US, there are three agencies that regulate genetically modified organisms: the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the USDA, US Department of Agriculture. Took these folks two years to decide that it would be the FDA that would regulate the genetically modified mosquito. And they would do it as a new animal drug, if that makes any sense. Took them another five years going back and forth and back and forth to convince the FDA that this would not harm people, and it would not harm the environment. They finally gave them, this summer, permission to run a little test in the Florida Keys, where they had been invited years earlier when they Keys had an outbreak of dengue. Would that it were that easy. When the local residents heard that there would be genetically modified mosquitoes tested in their community some of them began to organize protests. They even organized a petition on the internet with this cuddly logo, which eventually accumulated some 160,000 signatures And they demanded a referendum which will be conducted in just a couple of weeks about whether the trials would be permitted at all. Well it's Miami that really needs these better ways of controlling insects. And there the attitudes are changing. In fact, very recently a bipartisan group of more than 60 legislators wrote to HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell asking that she, at the Federal level, expedite access for Florida to this new technology. So the bottom line is this: biological control of harmful insects can be both more effective and very much more environmentally friendly than using insecticides, which are toxic chemicals. That was true in Rachel Carson's time; it's true today. What's different is that we have enormously more information about genetics than we had then, and therefore more ability to use that information to affect these biological controls. And I hope that what I've done is aroused your curiosity enough to start your own inquiry \u2014 not into just GM mosquitoes but to the other genetically modified organisms that are so controversial today. I think if you do that, and you dig down through all of the misinformation, and the marketing on the part of the organic food industry and the Greenpeaces and find the science, the accurate science, you'll be surprised and pleased. Thank you. (Applause)","label":1}

{"text":"\ufeff31.\t In addressing the President of this distinguished forum and in expressing to you my warmest congratulations, I am addressing the representative of a country-the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\u2014with which Romania has excellent relations of good-neighborliness, friendship and collaboration. I hope that your mission will be crowned with a success, which will, of course, reflect also upon your country.\n32.\tNow that Mr. Amerasinghe has concluded his term of office as President of the thirty-first session of the General Assembly, it falls to us to acknowledge that he is leaving behind him the memory of an active President who unstintedly devoted his well-known qualities to the success of our work. For this, he has our gratitude.\n33.\tI wish to pay a warm tribute to our Secretary-General, Mr. Kurt Waldheim, and hope that the new mandate entrusted to him by the General Assembly at its last session will give a new impetus to the noble task he carries out with so much dedication and skill.\n34.\tAt the beginning of each autumn, representatives of Governments of the States Members of the United Nations return to this hall to make a clear analysis of the international situation and also to seek together ways and means which can bring about for our world a reign of peace, understanding and co-operation among peoples.\n35.\tAt the risk of repeating some well-known truths-in the words of the old saying, repetitio mater studiorum\u2014l will say once again that a new spirit is emerging in the world in inter-State relations.\n36.\tThis phenomenon is due to the great changes which have occurred in the world arena, the characteristic feature of which is the clear determination of the peoples to develop as the true masters of their destinies and to co-operate in climate of peace and real understanding.\n37.\tThe attainment in these last years of the twentieth century of national independence and sovereignty by all peoples is proving to be an unalterable law of social development, a necessity of human society's advancement, a categorical imperative of history. This has been proved by experience everywhere, including the experience of the Romanian people, which this year celebrated the centennial of Romania's independence as a State-an achievement which inaugurated a new era in its thousand years of history and strongly asserting its will and determination to live free and independent.\n38.\tAware of the realities of the surrounding world and of the events and phenomena which characterize the evolution of the human community, the Romanian people are mobilizing their resources and capacities in an intensive effort to achieve the objectives of economic and social development which they have set themselves.\n39.\tOne of their main preoccupations this year is the effort to overcome the consequences of yet another severe trial, the third to be inflicted on it in this decade through the unleashing of the forces of nature. During the tragic moments of the catastrophic earthquake of 4 March 1977, more than 1,500 lives were lost; more than 11,000 people were injured; and more than 35,000 families were left homeless\u2014to say nothing of the tens of thousands of houses damaged. There was extensive damage to schools, hospitals and business premises. Almost 800 units in the basic fields of industry, construction and transport were affected by the catastrophe, and valuable installations and equipment were put out of order, with a consequent substantial loss of production. There was also heavy damage to agriculture.\n40.\tDemonstrating a high spirit of self-denial and energy, of high moral virtues and strong cohesion, the Romanian people closed ranks in a spirit of unity to overcome the difficulties, ensuring an early normalization of the economic and social life of the country in order to eliminate fully the consequences of the catastrophe and to continue their advance on the road to progress.\n41.\tEfforts to develop and modernize the whole economy are accompanied by a lasting concern to ensure, thanks to the results achieved in the development of the national economy, an increase in the level of culture and well-being of all the people, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, continuously to strengthen the democracy of our national life through the intensification of effective participation by working people in the management of economic and social institutions and in the shaping and implementation of the State's entire policy.\n42.\tAt the same time Romania is engaged in extensive international activities, developing wide economic, political, cultural and scientific relations with all States of the world. We are endeavouring to place Romania's relations with other States on a still firmer footing, being convinced that this is in the interests of the progress of our peoples and also constitutes a contribution to the promotion of the new principles of inter-State relations and to the strengthening of detente, peace and co-operation throughout the world.\n43.\tThe two new admissions to the United Nations, which were warmly endorsed by the Romanian delegation, also have a symbolic value. The presence in this Organization of a reunified Viet Nam reminds us once again that no force on earth can overcome a people determined to secure and defend its right to a free and independent life. Romania views with sympathy, and lends its full support, to the attempt made by the friendly Vietnamese people to rebuild their country and recover from the adverse consequences of the war. Romania hopes that the moral duty of contributing to the healing of the wounds caused by the war in Viet Nam will be fulfilled.\n44.\tThe admission of the young African State, the Republic of Djibouti, recalls in turn the intensification of peoples' national liberation movements, which prefigures the near and inevitable end of the colonial system which has left a deep imprint on, and thorny problems in, contemporary international relations.\n45.\tIn Latin America, too, the struggle of the Panamanian people to recover sovereignty over their whole national territory has been marked by important success with the signing of the new Panama Canal treaty.\n46.\tAll these events rank among the revolutionary processes which are occurring in the world. Ideas about a new world of justice and equity at the national and international level have become a living reality in a number of countries that are building up with remarkable results, a new social order in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Today socialist ideas are inspiring an even great number of peoples who are showing their desire and will to embark, in one form or another, upon the socialist path of development. The small and medium-size countries and the developing and non- aligned countries reject, with increased vigour, the tendency to have them play a secondary role in international life, and they are asserting themselves ever more actively on the world scene. The movement of peoples aimed at setting up a new policy based on respect for national independence and sovereignty is growing ever stronger.\n47.\tThese profound changes which I have described create favourable conditions for the achievement of a new international order built upon the solid foundation of the principles of international law, in order to solve, in a democratic spirit and to the benefit of all nations, the great issues confronting mankind.\n48.\tThe eradication of the state of under-development which afflicts large numbers of countries is an essential imperative of the contemporary world. Undoubtedly, the decisive role in the eradication of economic backwardness devolves upon the under-developed countries themselves, through their own efforts. However, at the same time, it is essential that their efforts be supported by broad international co-operation based upon the principles of equality and justice within the framework of the new international economic order. Such an order, favouring the more rapid advancement of the developing countries, is, as was emphasized by President Ceausescu,\n . .. not only an essential prerequisite for the flourishing of the under-developed countries, but also a basic element for the progress of all States and for world economic stability. That is why all States and the whole human community must work in concert for the establishment of the new economic order. \n49.\tAs a result of the initiative shown by the developing countries, in particular within the United Nations and its bodies, resolutions and programmes have been adopted which outline a number of norms and principles, as well as actions, aimed at the establishment of a new economic order and international economic co-operation. Their effectiveness depends, of course, upon the extent to which they are observed and applied by Member States. As a matter of fact, we have to admit that very little has been done in this respect. At present it is necessary to show greater determination to continue and conclude successfully the actions already started.\n50.\tSince the setting up of a new framework for international economic relations is a problem of such vital importance to every State, it is necessary, in our view, to create conditions conducive to the participation of all States on an equal footing in all stages of the negotiations.\n51.\tWe view as a positive step the abandonment of the restricted framework of negotiations at the Paris Conference on International Economic Co-operation, the so- called  North-South dialogue , as well as the general conclusion to concentrate the debates and negotiations on the new economic order in the United Nations with the participation of all States on a democratic basis.\n52.\tIt now becomes imperative that the General Assembly plays its central role in these negotiations, ensuring a unified approach to them. In this spirit, we welcome the idea of convening a special session of the General Assembly devoted \u00bbo development and the new economic order. In our opinion, the results of all these negotiations must be translated into specific commitments by all States in the form of a code of international economic relations that should include the principles and norms governing economic relations among States, their rights and obligations in various fields of international co-operation\u2014in trade, raw materials, energy, transport, technology, industry, agriculture, financial and credit relations-as well as establishing the machinery for giving practical effect to the commitments undertaken.\n53.\tThe new economic order implies broad and unhindered access by the developing countries to advanced technologies and to all the achievements of modern science and technology. It implies also giving those countries the required technical assistance and effective help in the training of personnel. The practice of recruiting skilled workers and specialists from the developing countries prevents the peoples concerned from solving the acute problems of their development. It is high time we put an end to such practices, and further, in the spirit of the new international economic order, arrange for the specialists who have been attracted by various means to the advanced countries to return home.\n54.\tIn our view, one suitable means organizing negotiations on all those problems could be the united Nations Conference on Science and Technology for Development, to take place in 1979. That Conference should develop measures for ensuring the access of the developing countries to the achievements of science and technology, for ensuring technical assistance and personnel training in all fields and for promoting and stimulating scientific research in the under-developed countries.\n55.\tThe developing countries have an important\u2014indeed primary-role in the efforts to ensure the triumph of the new international economic order. The essential goal of that new order is to make it possible for every nation to earn its own living and exchange on a fair basis of the products of its work in its trade relations. This is a perfectly legitimate objective. The developing countries' capacity to take efficient action to this end is based on their unity and solidarity. We all know that great pressures are exerted upon those countries for the very purpose of breaking their unity and solidarity. We are confident that they will find the resources and the means to overcome those pressures.\n56.\tMankind's advancement requires that the establishment of a new international economic order be organically linked to the process of disarmament .\n57.\tIn our view, disarmament-above all, nuclear disarmament\u2014is an essential problem of the contemporary era. We should all realize that the crucial moment when we must act is now, for there can be no doubt that the development of every nation, and the life and peaceful future of mankind, depend upon halting the arms race and achieving disarmament. These simple truths should be fully grasped by every inhabitant of our planet and by all nations. With the present destructive capacity of modern weapons, genuine security can only be sought through disarmament. Lasting peace is inconceivable as long as the arms race, which has now reached alarming proportions, continues. What is the basic reason for this arms race? The attainment of hypothetical balances in the level of armaments of various countries? We have no wish-I should like to make that crystal-clear\u2014for any unilateral military advantages to be obtained by a State or group of States. But I wish to be equally clear in saying that we do' not see what hope there can be of achieving a balance based on the ever-ascending spiral of the arms race. We consider that until complete disarmament is reached, mutual security measures should be taken at ever-lower levels of armed forces and armaments. It is not by inventing new weapons-whatever the explanations put forward-that we can convince the world that we want peace, but only by putting an end to the arms race. only thus can the nations have material proof of States' good faith in their declared commitment to disarmament and the danger of war diminish.\n58.\tThe extremely harmful effects of the arms race are eloquently and scientifically described in a report entitled Economic and social consequences of the arms race and of military expenditures, which was the outcome of a Romanian initiative and which has been brought up to date this year by a group of experts \n59.\tWe feel that the General Assembly should ensure the widest dissemination of that report with a view to keeping Governments and international public opinion informed We are convinced that this will contribute to a better understanding of the imperative need for disarmament.\n60.\tThe problems of disarmament are of course quite complex. However, it is their very complexity which, instead of being constantly invoked and regarded as an obstacle to a direct attack on those problems, should impel us to assert the political will to tackle them courageously and with the determination to reach specific disarmament measures.\n61.\tIn our view, the United Nations can and should play a greater role in this domain, and as disarmament is of vital interest to all States they should have the right and opportunity to have a say in the discussions and negotiations on all disarmament measures. That is why Romania attaches great importance to the special session of the United Nations General Assembly devoted to the problems of disarmament, to be held in May and June 1978. As a member of the Preparatory Committee, my country will do its best to create the necessary conditions for that session to give strong impetus to the nations' efforts to achieve disarmament. The session should be used for the assertion by Governments of their political will to take real steps towards disarmament.\n62.\tDisarmament has become a basic component of European security. Unfortunately, we are compelled to state that a growing contradiction is developing in Europe between the positive steps taken so far towards detente- the expansion of political contacts and the development of economic, technical, scientific, cultural and artistic exchanges\u2014and the continuation, or even intensification, of the arms race. There is a great concentration of weapons and troops in Europe. Four years after their inception, the Vienna negotiations have not passed the exchange-of- information  stage. The political will to achieve measures for disarmament and military disengagement in Europe has not yet emerged.\n63.\tThe corner-stone of the European security system that was outlined by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is the strict observance of the principles of international law and the removal from international relations of the policy of force and threat of force. To achieve the final elimination of this policy the need is felt to conclude an all-European treaty that should include the commitment by all the States which participated in that Conference to renounce the use or threat of force, as well as the commitment by the States possessing nuclear weapons never to use those weapons in any form against other States or groups of States. The creation of peaceful, nuclear-free zones, including one in the Balkans, would also be a valuable contribution to the cause of European security. The duty of all States signatories of the Final Act is to take action for its implementation as a whole in the shortest possible space of time. We are hopeful\u2014at any rate we shall do our best in this direction-that the conference which is to start in Belgrade before long will give a strong impetus to the efforts along this line and will open up prospects for the unhindered development of co-operation in economic questions, technology, science and culture, as well as in other fields of humanitarian interest among the European peoples, in this context, Romania supports the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union regarding the convening of a European conference on transport, energy and environmental protection, as well as in other areas of mutual interest. \n64.\tOut of a spirit of responsibility for the fate of international peace and security, Romania and President Ceausescu are firmly supporting the complete renunciation of force in relations among States and the settlement of all disputes among States by peaceful means, and they are thus making an active contribution to the attainment of those objectives. Such imperatives guided Romania's action, together with that of other States, in the Security Council during its term of office as a non-permanent member.\n65.\tBelieving that force has never produced a lasting solution to any international issue but, on the contrary, has hampered the finding of a solution, Romania is doing its utmost to stimulate action in favour of a settlement of the Middle East conflict on the basis of the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Arab territories occupied as a result of the 1967 war, the recognition of the Palestinian people's right to self-determination, including the right to establish a Palestinian Arab State, and the guaranteeing of the independence and sovereignty of all States in the region. We are in favour of the convening, as soon as possible, of the Geneva Peace Conference on the Middle East, with the participation of all the countries concerned, including the Palestine Liberation Organization as the only representative of the Palestinian people. As I have already stressed on other occasions, the United Nations should play a more active role than it has played so far in the political settlement of the problems of that part of the world, and the Secretary-General of our Organization is called upon to be present in all the actions undertaken To achieve peace in the Middle East.\n66.\tThe settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the observance of the independence and sovereignty of Cyprus and the securing of the peaceful coexistence of the two Cypriot communities would do much to strengthen trust and develop peaceful co-operation in the Balkans, in Europe and throughout the world.\n67.\tIn Korea, the constructive initiatives and proposals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea aimed at relaxing tensions, the elimination of the North-South confrontation and the resumption of contacts and the improvement of relations between the two parts of the country offer a solid foundation for the fulfillment of the Korean people's earnest hopes for their country's peaceful, independent and democratic reunification.\n68.\tIn Africa, the tensions among certain States should be overcome at the negotiation table by action for the strengthening of the African countries' unity and collaboration, with a view to their independent economic and social advancement.\n69.\tRomania-faithful to the ideals that prompted the long struggle waged by the Romanian people for freedom and social progress\u2014firmly supports the struggle of all peoples still under colonial and racial domination to combat that anarchism, which is incompatible with the ethics and principles proclaimed nowadays by all peoples of the world. My country is fighting for the abolition of all forms of foreign domination over other peoples.\n70.\tWe are on the side of all oppressed peoples and we deem it our moral duty to give our full support\u2014political, diplomatic and material-to the national liberation movements in Namibia and Zimbabwe and to the struggle of the peoples in South Africa against racial discrimination and the policy of apartheid, as well as to the independent African States that have suffered from the aggressive actions of the racist regimes.\n71.\tIn our view, present international circumstances require more determined action within the United Nations and on the international level as a whole in order to secure the liberation of the peoples of southern Africa at the earliest opportunity and to put an end, once and for all, to any encroachment upon the freedom and national rights of the African peoples and an end to any forms of domination and foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other peoples.\n72.\tAll these are extremely complex problems confronting the contemporary world. They can be solved through the active participation of all States on an equal footing within the framework of a new and democratic order. This reality is determining and strengthening the role of international organizations with a universal vocation and particularly that of the United Nations. Referring to this fact, President Ceausescu has stated:\n High responsibilities for the achievement of such democratic co-operation among States devolve upon the United Nations, which offers the most appropriate organizational framework for debating the issues with the effective participation of all States. Romania supports the United Nations and makes its contribution, in the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, to the finding of solutions in order that its organization and statute should better correspond to the great changes that have been occurring in the world as well as to the aspirations and expectations of all peoples.\n73.\tWe have a positive assessment of the activity carried out so far by the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. The list of proposals annexed to the Committee's report this year  seems to us to be a useful basis for a continuation of the dialogue as well as for identifying measures and actions capable of leading to a greater role for the United Nations in international life. We are confident that, through the concerted endeavours of Member States, the Special Committee will be able at its forthcoming meetings to devise such measures and actions, and in this way discharge the mandate entrusted to it by the General Assembly. Thus, the United Nations will be able to become an instrument of co-operation available to States and show itself capable of playing an active part in the establishment of the new international economic order, in the achievement of disarmament, in the struggle against any infringements of the principles of international law, in the democratic settlement of all international issues, and in the furtherance of wide co-operation among States.\n74.\tAt the beginning of every autumn, the attention of people's is focused on this forum where the most acute issues related to international peace and co-operation are debated.\n75.\tAs at the beginning of every autumn, hopes are reviving. And our duty is to justify those hopes, to give them a positive answer, to prove, through our redoubled efforts, that mankind has entered a new era of its civilization, that men and peoples are capable of solving the most difficult problems, and that the dreadful spectre of war is moving away from us.\n76.\tThe aims that we have set ourselves are attainable; they are in the realm of the possible. However, their attainment requires political will, energy, perseverance and a dynamic and far-reaching view of the future.\n77.\tThe work of the present session of the General Assembly must go down in the history of the United Nations as a noteworthy contribution to the fulfilment of the historic mission of this forum.\n78.\tThis is the desire and will of the Romanian delegation, and all our actions will be directed towards this goal.\n \n","label":1}

{"text":"Shipping internationally represents more than just a way to get your goods from your door to your customers worldwide. Doing this effectively demonstrates your commitment to quality and your dedication to all of your customers.\n\nWhile logistics and shipping mistakes are easy to make, the good news is that they\u2019re just as easy to identify and correct. By catching these common mistakes, you\u2019ll gain a competitive edge and most importantly get your products to their destination in the best condition.\n\nYour valued customers will feel that you understand their needs. Read on for some of the most common international shipping mistakes and how you can correct them.\n\n1. Not understanding your destination\u2019s regulations\n\nShipping domestically is fairly straightforward. The moment you make the move to ship outside the U.S., you\u2019ll enter into all sorts of mess. Countries have their own regulations and customs requirements, some more extensive than others.\n\nWork with your fulfillment partner to make sure you have the proper documentation at hand and your product is in compliance to enter the specific country. You should also perform your due diligence and stay up to date on a country\u2019s laws because current events have a great impact on them.\n\n2. Incorrectly packaged shipments\n\nToo many times the wrong box is chosen for the product. This is usually happens because the product may just fit into whatever was picked, but sometimes the packaging may be too big or too tight.\n\nThis can significantly impact your shipping costs. Having the appropriate packaging ready and proper planning will keep you ahead of the game, saving you a lot of time and money.\n\nAlso be aware of the quality of your boxes. Keep in consideration that the box will suffer quite the beating, especially when traveling over seas.\n\n3. Mislabeled packages\n\nMislabeling your packages \u2014 putting the wrong address \u2014 causes delays and increases shipping costs. Don\u2019t forget that your boxes and labels will also need to reflect information such as the country of origin and the presence of any note-worthy materials.\n\nNo one likes when their package goes to the wrong address.\n\nAlso remember to double check the weight, dimensions and shipping zone. You should communicate well with your fulfillment partner to clear up any possible labeling issues and make sure you have the green light to ship.\n\n4. Choosing the wrong shipping company\n\nHaving the appropriate shipping company on deck is imperative for international operations as the right partner is well-equipped to handle the obstacles that normally fall into play. There\u2019s a tendency to choose the cheapest carrier, but this is the most common mistake.\n\nDon\u2019t play with choosing a carrier.\n\nA lot of the time the low cost carriers most likely have hidden not initially told to you and may be too inexperienced. In the same breath, There are carriers that are relatively cheap and provide great value. You really need to perform your research to identify them.","label":0}

{"text":"\ufeffFirst of all. Sir, I should like to congratulate you heartily on your election to the high office of President of the General Assembly at its forty-second session. We are sincerely pleased that this great honour has been bestowed upon a representative of a fraternal country, the German Democratic Republic. I wish you every success in carrying out your responsible duties.\nI wish also to express our gratitude to the Secretary-General, Mr. Javier P\u00e9rez de Cuellar, and to assure him of Czechoslovakia's support in his praiseworthy work on behalf of the United Nations and the entire international community.\nThe general debate thus far has indicated - and I should like to believe - that the current session will make a significant contribution to the solution of the most urgent problems facing us today and that it will help in shaping the concept of a non-violent and nuclear-weapon-free world in which comprehensive security for all mankind would guarantee for everyone in the world the most. That hope is especially justifiable in the light of the agreement in principle between the USSR and the United States of America on the elimination of two classes of nuclear weapons, an agreement of great political and psychological importance. The conclusion of such a treaty, which is so strongly desired by the nations of the world, would lead for the first time in history to the agreed elimination of part of the world's accumulated nuclear arsenals. It would be a great step towards a genuine process of disarmament and would show that improvements are not confined to outlining theoretical programmes but are rather taking a concrete form.\nProspects are opening for reaching further important agreements. The productive results of the Stockholm Conference on Confidence- and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe can undoubtedly be counted among the positive developments. An atmosphere of businesslike constructive dialogue prevailed also at the Vienna follow-up meeting of the States signatories of the Helsinki Final Act. Consultations are being held between representatives of countries of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on measures for conventional disarmament from the Atlantic to the Urals. Another positive international development is the contact between representatives of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and of the European Economic Community.\nA valuable contribution to the process of strengthening peace and understanding among peoples and improving the world situation has been made by the New Delhi Six. The Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has been undertaking peace-making activities, as was shown clearly by the outcome of its summit conference, held at Harare.\nAll this confirms the emergence of a new thinking on a broad spectrum of issues in international relations. That new thinking is finding its way also into the halls and conference rooms of the United Nations, an organization designed to mould civilized relations among all countries and to harmonize their interests on a new basis.\nWe are convinced that these glimmers of hope derive from real factors. We ate seeing the establishment and strengthening of a broad front of individuals, organizations, parties, governments and States united by their mutual goal of preserving human civilization. The socialist countries are doing their part in this struggle by taking qualitatively new initiatives based specifically on the process of activating the intrinsic potential of socialism and implementing programmes of restructuring. It could not be otherwise, since the ensuring of a lasting peace is an indispensable condition for the attainment of the objectives of restructuring and for the acceleration of social and economic development.\nHowever, we are aware that on the balance sheet of international relations there are still many items on the debit side. The arms race is continuing. New programmes of armament costing billions are being launched. local conflicts persist and threaten to grow into major international crises. Like a scar on the conscience of mankind, mass violations of human rights such as racism and apartheid persist. Crises in the world economy are growing worse. Environmental problems are reaching critical dimensions.\nAll this sets a clear imperative for politicians, who bear a responsibility for the future of their nations: they must do their utmost to avert nuclear disaster, ensure stable peace and jointly resolve the most pressing problems of mankind.\nWe are not far from the date when the first day of a new century and a new millennium will appear on our calendars. We have a unique opportunity to pass this planet on to posterity as a safe and good place to live. That context gives special prominence to the humanistic legacy of the great October socialist revolution, the seventieth anniversary of which will soon be commemorated by mankind. That was an event of extraordinary, epoch-making importance. It introduced into world politics the concept of peaceful coexistence between States with differing social systems. It is of more than symbolic significance that in its very first document, Lenin's decree on peace, the October Revolution rejected armed force as an instrument of foreign policy. \nToday in Czechoslovakia, in the socialist world, a major restructuring of all spheres of social life is under way in the light of those ideas, and the process of deepening socialist democracy is continuing. This is all tied very closely to universal human values, to the need to build and establish relationships of close joint action among States in our interrelated world, where the relationship between the national and the international is changing. It is an appeal to work together and make use of all the possibilities available.\nThe Czechoslovak people have a vital interest in the success of the peace policy. They regard it as a guarantee of their present and their future. In the words of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and President of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Gustav Husak: 'We shall contribute to the strengthening of the front of peace, sound reason and realism in the world so as to make the prospects of peace ever safer.'\nThat aim is also being pursued through the initiative concerning the establishment of a comprehensive system of international peace and security introduced in this forum by the socialist countries. It should constitute a set of specific, jointly agreed measures that would primarily provide, to an ever increasing degree, for greater effectiveness and practical reinforcement of the binding power of the fundamental laws of international life as embodied in the United Nations Charter.\nThe reality of a secure world is inseparably tied to its safeguards. The mechanism for this should be the United Nations. This is our understanding of the well-known article by Mikhail S. Gorbachev that was published on the eve of this session. We believe that the suggestions formulated therein will give a strong impetus to the activity of the United Nations and of all States in building and safeguarding comprehensive security. \nWe believe that the creation of security guarantees in the military sphere, the adoption of concrete measures for halting the arms build-up and proceeding to step-by-step disarmament, and the reduction of the military potential of States to reasonable levels are of decisive importance. Such measures would be conducive to the implementation of the programme, vital to mankind, for the elimination of nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction by the year 2000. That programme is realistic because it is based on the need to ensure equal security for all participating countries at all stages of the disarmament process.\nWe are confident that the first genuine breakthrough in the field of nuclear disarmament will be the conclusion and implementation o\u00a3 the treaty on the global elimination of Soviet and United States intermediate-range and operational-tactical nuclear missiles. We have done our best to facilitate that positive move towards real disarmament and. we are ready to continue our efforts in the expectation that other countries directly concerned will proceed in the same spirit.\nThe conclusion of this treaty at a summit meeting should be a historic prologue to the unfolding of a comprehensive process of disarmament in which a 50 per cent reduction of strategic offensive weapons, with consistent observance of the Soviet-United States anti-ballistic-missile Treaty, could be the next step.\nWe welcome the idea of stepping up the work of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament so that it may gradually become a permanent, universal negotiating body on disarmament. In our view it should work on a year-round basis. We feel that it would be appropriate to consider this subject also and to adopt corresponding measures, for instance at the third special session of the United Nations General Assembly on disarmament, to be held next year.\nAnother hopeful sign this year is the development with regard to a convention on the complete prohibition of chemical weapons and the elimination of stockpiles of such weapons. The conclusion of such a convention would also be an event of great importance for all mankind. In this context\/ we appreciate the constructive statement of the Soviet Union in Geneva this year that in the negotiations it will proceed on the basis of the legal stipulation of the principle of mandatory inspections upon request and without the right of rejection. We fully endorse that approach and hope that other countries will proceed on the same lines. That position is a demonstration of the readiness of the socialist countries to ensure effective verification of the entire disarmament process in conditions of openness and confidence. In this spirit we want to take an active part in consideration of verification questions in the United Nations as well.\nThe need to resolve the issue of a ban on the testing of nuclear weapons is ever more imperative. We believe that this, too, will be significantly facilitated by the agreed comprehensive phased negotiations between the Soviet Union and the United States. We continue to regard it as extraordinarily important to prevent the stationing of weapons in space and agree on a programme of joint practical action in the peaceful uses of outer space. We support the establishment of a system of international verification of the preservation of peace in outer space.\nGlobal security is closely linked with the strengthening of security and the development of peaceful relations, co-operation and confidence in Europe, a continent which, unfortunately, is still burdened with an excessive quantity of nuclear and conventional arsenals. \u2116at is why it is especially necessary to have a policy of d\u00e9tente, that process of consolidating the foundations of the common European house that is proof of the viability of the principle of the coexistence of the two systems. Today, after some vacillation and even stagnation, and doubts having been overcome, the all-European process is again gaining momentum. More pronounced results have been achieved in the political, military, humanitarian and other spheres. \nThe Budapest appeal of the Warsaw Treaty countries to the States members of  the North Atlantic Treaty organisation (SATU) to agree on a substantial reduction of armed forces and conventional armaments in Europe remains highly topical. We are encouraged by the fact that the contours of future talks on those important questions, as well as on the development of confidence- and security-building, has begun to emerge in Vienna. We consider that those issues must be dealt with through the point of view of their interrelationship within the framework of the all-European process. An important part of European security and co-operation is the whole complex of mutual economic contacts. In order further to advance such contacts we proposed at the Vienna follow-up meeting the holding of a European economic forum in Prague, at which the whole range of questions relating to development in trade, industrial co-operation, finance and other specific areas would be addressed. \nOf no less importance in our view is the further development of co-operation in humanitarian matters. We are engaged in a constructive solution of these issues in both multilateral negotiations and bilateral relations. The entire humanitarian dimension of the European process, including respect for the political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights, should be considered at the proposed conference  the holding of which in Moscow we fully support. At the same time, it is our assumption that it is necessary to have an all-embracing approach to this subject, an approach that we are consequently pursuing.\nAt the session of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member States held in Berlin this year we called on the countries members of the NATO to engage in joint consultations on military doctrines. We reaffirmed that the Warsaw Treaty States will never, under any conditions, launch military actions against any state or alliance of States unless they themselves become the object of an armed attack, and they also stated that they would never be the first to use nuclear weapons.\nAs a country located along the line of contact between the two military and political groupings, we are very much interested in a supervised withdrawal of nuclear and other offensive weapons from national borders. We have therefore, jointly with the German Democratic Republic, proposed to the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free corridor along the line of contact between the NATO and Warsaw Treaty countries in Central Europe. Similarly, we have put forward a joint initiative for the creation of a chemical-weapon-free zone in the Central European region. This measure could be the first step towards the complete elimination of chemical weapons.\nIt is our view that stability would be strengthened significantly through implementation of the plan of the Government of the Polish People's Republic for a limitation of armaments and for enhancing trust and confidence in Central Europe. We call upon our partners to take a constructive stance on these proposals of ours and thus to engage in the solution of the questions of common security in a spirit of co-responsibility.\nThe ensuring of comprehensive international security is unthinkable without energetic efforts to bring about a just settlement of international disputes and conflicts which, in a number of places, continue to undermine world peace and stability.\nWe are deeply concerned over the dangerous escalation of military tension in the Persian Gulf, which threatens to result in an Internationalisation of the conflict. We fully support the United Nations Secretary-General in his efforts to bring about a termination of the Iraq-Iran war and we call for a consistent implementation of Security Council resolution 598 (1987). The safety of navigation in the Gulf must be provided for by efforts of the international community as a whole.\nWe speak out with all resoluteness in favour of the holding of an international conference on the Middle East with the participation of the five permanent members of the Security Council and of other parties directly concerned, Including the Palestine Liberation Organization. The convening of such a conference is gaining ever increasing support. We regard as a key question the consequent exercise of the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination, including the establishment of their own State.\nWe commend the adoption of a peace plan for Central America at a meeting of the presidents of the countries of that region held this year in Guatemala and we appreciate the meritorious activity of the Contadora Group and of the countries supporting it. we value the determined steps taken by the Nicaraguan Government to carry out the decisions adopted. We vehemently condemn the illegal pressure exerted on this country, which is in direct contradiction with the basic norms of international law.\nWe are indignant over the untenable situation in southern Africa. The escalating acts of repression by the ruling racist minority against the native African population, the persisting occupation of Namibia and the overall increase in the aggressiveness of the Pretoria regime are destabilizing factors in international developments. We demand that all those who bear direct or indirect responsibility for the perpetuation of this perilous state of affairs proceed to adopt mandatory and effective sanctions, in harmony with the will of the international community, thus contributing to the eradication of apartheid. We resolutely support the just struggle of the front-line States against South African expansion.\nOur full support is extended to the policy of national reconciliation pursued by the Government of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan with increasing co-operation from all national forces. We are convinced that this policy, together with the peace-making mediation of the United Nations, will lead to a just settlement of the existing problems. In parallel, an end must of course be put to outside intervention against this peace process.\nWe welcome the fact that the idea of national consonance and harmony is gaining ground also in Kampuchea. We fully support the recent declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which shows a realistic move towards genuine reconciliation and should therefore not remain unanswered.\nWe firmly advocate the solution to the problem of Cyprus through the convening of an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations, to provide for the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of this non-aligned country. \nDue credit must be given to the constructive proposals made by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with a view to dissolving tensions on the Korean peninsula and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces and nuclear weapons. The initiative for a reduction of armed forces by both sides and the manifest willingness to take important unilateral steps in that direction is a significant contribution to the achievement of a peaceful reunification of the country.\nA valuable contribution by the United Nations to efforts aimed at a peaceful settlement of disputes is the working out of a draft declaration on the enhancement of the effectiveness of the principle of non-use of force in international relations. We express our desire to see this declaration unanimously adopted by the Assembly at this session.\nA considerable contribution to the attainment of the aims and objectives of our Organization in the field of global security could be made through implementation of a number of regional projects that have been contemplated.\nWorthy of primary attention in this regard are, in our view, the concepts of security, co-operation, confidence, and reduction of armaments in the Asian-Pacific region, the establishment of the Indian Ocean as a zone of peace, the conversion of the Mediterranean into an area of peaceful co-operation, and the proposal for the creation of nuclear-weapon-free zones in various parts of the world. Extraordinary interest has been shown in recent days in the important initiative of the Soviet Union to ensure security and co-operation in the northern regions of our planet; Czechoslovakia fully endorses the initiative.\nThe key tasks of achieving comprehensive security are also linked with the need for a basic improvement in international economic relations. Along with the other socialist countries, Czechoslovakia takes an unequivocal stance on these questions. A realistic solution can be found in generating the economic security of every State, of entire continents, and of the whole world within the framework of a comprehensive system of international security. This presupposes, among other things, the adoption of effective measures to break the fetters of massive indebtedness. What is required is the restructuring of the world monetary system, additional easements for the least developed countries, and gradual elimination of protectionism. Briefly, what is needed is the overcoming of backwardness through the dynamism of broad international economic co-operation. \nSimilarly, we consider it necessary to develop further the ideas and conclusions of the recent International Conference on the Relationship between Disarmament and Development. In their memorandum to the Conference the socialist countries presented an integrated plan for a realistic solution to those questions. We express our appreciation of the contributions made by all the participants to the success of the Conference.\nAs regards the ecological dimension of security we see the underlying solution of the relationship between man and nature in all aspects of human activities, in an improvement in the quality and rational utilization of the environment and of its resources in the interests of individual nations and of people everywhere. This includes measures to prevent abuse of the environment as a result of industrial and agricultural production, the use of preventive measures and early warning systems, and reparations for damages in cases of ecologically dangerous accidents. Sooner or later, ecological security must also encompass elimination of the most hazardous factors that threaten to destroy the conditions for life on our planet, namely, weapons of mass destruction.\nFor our part, we approach the discussion of these problems in all seriousness. As a State situated in the centre of Europe, we are confronted by those problems in an especially urgent manner. We allocate large sums of money for their solution. At the same time, we realize that an overall solution can be reached only if forces are joined within the framework of a global strategy for environmental conservation. We would urge the United Nations to begin to formulate such a strategy without delay. For our part, we are prepared at this session to contribute to such a programme.\nThe endeavour to participate actively in finding constructive solutions to international problems has a long-standing tradition in our country. It emanates from the inherent interests of our people, from the very roots of our socialist society, and from the foreign policy of our country. in these efforts, we proceed from the assumption that the United Nations is an irreplaceable global mechanism for co-operation designed to solve the fundamental questions of our times and to serve as a universal guarantor of peaceful coexistence and comprehensive security. The Czechoslovak Socialist Republic will continue to do its best to enhance the prestige of our Organization and make full use of its potential in the interests of peace and the security of nations. \n","label":1}

{"text":"I have one more reason for optimism: climate change. Maybe you don't believe it, but here is the fact. On December 12, 2015, in Paris, under the United Nations, 195 governments got together and unanimously \u2014 if you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is \u2014 unanimously decided to intentionally change the course of the global economy in order to protect the most vulnerable and improve the life of all of us. Now, that is a remarkable achievement. (Applause) But it is even more remarkable if you consider where we had been just a few years ago. 2009, Copenhagen. Who remembers Copenhagen? Well, after years of working toward a climate agreement, the same governments convened in Copenhagen and failed miserably. Why did it fail miserably? For many different reasons, but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide between the global North and the global South. So now, six months after this failure, I was called in to assume the responsibility of the global climate change negotiations. You can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new job. The global mood on climate change was in the trash can. No one believed that a global agreement could ever be possible. In fact, neither did I. If you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience, I'm going to divulge a secret that has been gratefully buried by history. On my first press conference, a journalist asked, \"Um, Ms. Figueres, do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible?\" And without engaging brain, I heard me utter, \"Not in my lifetime.\" Well, you can imagine the faces of my press team who were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman who was their new boss. And I was horrified, too. Now, I wasn't horrified at me, because I'm kind of used to myself. I was actually horrified at the consequences of what I had just said, at the consequences for the world in which all our children are going to have to live. It was frankly a horrible moment for me, and I thought, well, no, hang on, hang on. Impossible is not a fact, it's an attitude. It's only an attitude. And I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude and I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change. So I don't know \u2014 No, just this? Thanks. I don't know \u2014 what you would do if you were told your job is to save the planet. Put that on the job description. And you have full responsibility, but you have absolutely no authority, because governments are sovereign in every decision that they take. Well, I would really love to know what you would do on the first Monday morning, but here's what I did: I panicked. (Laughter) And then I panicked again, because I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem. And then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem, but I do know one thing: we have got to change the tone of this conversation. Because there is no way you can deliver victory without optimism. And here, I use optimism as a very simple word, but let's understand it in its broader sense. Let's understand it as courage, hope, trust, solidarity, the fundamental belief that we humans can come together and can help each other to better the fate of mankind. Well, you can imagine that I thought that without that, there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen. And for six years, I have stubbornly, relentlessly injected optimism into the system, no matter what the questions from the press \u2014 and I have gotten better at those \u2014 and no matter what the evidence to the contrary. And believe you me, there has been a lot of contrary evidence. But relentless optimism into the system. And pretty soon, we began to see changes happening in many areas, precipitated by thousands of people, including many of you here today, and I thank you. And this TED community will not be surprised if I tell you the first area in which we saw remarkable change was ... technology. We began to see that clean technologies, in particular renewable energy technologies, began to drop price and increase in capacity, to the point where today we are already building concentrated solar power plants that have the capacity to power entire cities, to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility and intelligent buildings. And with this shift in technologies, we were able to begin to understand that there was a shift in the economic equation, because we were able to recognize that yes, there are huge costs to climate change, and yes, there are compounded risks. But there also are economic advantages and intrinsic benefits, because the dissemination of the clean technologies is going to bring us cleaner air, better health, better transportation, more livable cities, more energy security, more energy access to the developing world. In sum, a better world than what we have now. And with that understanding, you should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were, the spread of ingenuity and excitement that went through, first through nonnational governments, the private sector, captains of industry, insurance companies, investors, city leaders, faith communities, because they all began to understand, this actually can be in their interest. This can actually improve their bottom line. And it wasn't just the usual suspects. I have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, major oil and gas company come to me at the beginning of last year and say \u2014 privately, of course \u2014 he did not know how he was going to change his company, but he is going to change it, because he's interested in long-term viability. Well, now we have a shift in the economic equation, and with that, with broader support from everyone, it did not take very long before we saw that national governments woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest. And when we asked countries to begin to identify how they could contribute to global efforts but based on their national interest, 189 countries out of 195, 189 countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans, based on their national interest, concurrent with their priorities, consistent with their national sustainable development plans. Well, once you protect the core interests of nations, then you can understand that nations were ready to begin to converge onto a common path, onto a common direction of travel that is going to take us probably several decades, but over those several decades is going to take us into the new economy, into a decarbonized, highly resilient economy, And the national contributions that are currently on the table on behalf of national governments are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate, but they are only the first step, and they will improve over time. And the measurement, reporting and verification of all of those efforts is legally binding. And the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding, and the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy is legally binding. And here's the more important part: What did we have before? A very small handful of countries who had undertaken very reduced, short-term emission reduction commitments that were completely insufficient and furthermore, largely perceived as a burden. Now what do we have? Now we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities from different approaches in different sectors, but all of them contributing to a common goal and along a path with environmental integrity. Well, once you have all of this in place and you have shifted this understanding, then you see that governments were able to go to Paris and adopt the Paris agreement. (Applause) So, as I look back over the past six years, first I remember the day the Paris agreement was adopted. I cannot tell you the euphoria in the room. 5,000 people jumping out of their seats, crying, clapping, screaming, yelling, torn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen, because so many people had worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality. And it wasn't just those who had participated directly. A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague who was trying to decide on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha. And once he had finally decided what he was going to buy, the jeweler said to him, \"You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now, because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change.\" \"But,\" the jeweler said, \"have you heard, the governments have just come to a decision, and Tahiti could have a chance.\" Well, what a fantastic confirmation that perhaps, perhaps here is hope, here is a possible chance. I'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do. We've only just started our work on climate change. And in fact, we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts over the next five years that are the urgent five years. But I do believe that we have come over the past six years from the impossible to the now unstoppable. And how did we do that? By injecting transformational optimism that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration, that allowed us to understand that national and local interests are not necessarily at odds with global needs, and that if we understand that, we can bring them together and we can merge them harmoniously. And as I look forward to other global issues that will require our attention this century \u2014 food security, water security, home security, forced migration \u2014 I see that we certainly do not know how we are going to solve those problems yet. But we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change and we can understand that we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality. Because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers, and that your loss is my gain. Well, now that we're in a world in which we have reached planetary boundaries and that we are not just so interconnected, but increasingly interdependent on each other, your loss is no longer my gain. We're either all losers or we all can be winners. But we are going to have to decide between zero and sum. We're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all or living life as the sum of all of us. We've done it once. We can do it again. Thanks. (Applause)","label":1}

Motion carries that six votes. And next up is 31.\nSpeaker 0: Report from Development Services recommendation declare ordinance amending the Long Beach Municipal Code related to the regulation of nuisance motels read and adopted as read citywide.\nSpeaker 1: I have a motion any second. I do have some public comment on this item. Uh as an I can't fee and Jerry Glenn Thomas are the two folks I have is Jerry Glenn Thomas here? Nope. Mr.. Can we go ahead? Please put. The micron.\nSpeaker 12: Okay.\nSpeaker 11: It's unfortunate. Can I get my 8 seconds back mouse again? It's unfortunate that all the housing people have left, because I'm really curious on what the municipal code defines a nuisance motel. Being curious because, you know, everyone watching those that don't know, you know, motels are a vital part of the ecosystem of housing homeless people. So I'm always worried when I see that term Nuisance Motel. I know what it means. It means that there's drug activity possible, gang activity possible, uh, you know, uh, prostitution, etc., etc.. And this is true. But I'm worried that when we define things, uh, as such, it limits the opportunity of places for a lot of our homeless and housing impaired people to go to these vouchers. My mother works for the Department of Family Service at the county building on Santa Fe, and she specifically she's eligibility worker, so she's defining who gets to have a housing voucher each and every month. There's over 60 people a month. Those are 60 people who take housing vouchers from the county. And where do they go? No, there's no there's very rarely any Section eight or or apartment or subsidized housing providers who are taking these vouchers. So nine out of ten times, most of these homeless people who are on the streets are going to the county building, getting a voucher from them and then going to a motel. So if we start getting rid of these motels and or we start labeling them as nuisance motels, we're therefore eliminating housing opportunities for homeless people, thereby putting more people on the streets. So I'm just curious to see, like, what what, you know, what were the finances? And I'm worried that, you know, I understand that some of these motels are are, you know, harboring certain activity. And we don't want in areas that are now being redefined and changed and rightfully that's. And I appreciate them for that. However, you know, we can't get rid of opportunities for homeless people to have housing and at the same time say, well, we're going to knock down this nuisance motel. And then in 5 to 10 years after, it's been an empty lot for X amount of years because we don't actually have the capital funding to build the building on top of it, we're going to put affordable housing there one day. So it's like you're going to get rid of motels that actually do homes house homeless people right now or what. So I'm just curious to see what the city is going to do with that, because that county money is really like people are using these motels purely to get off the streets today. So.\nSpeaker 1: Thanks. Thank you. Thank you very much. That concludes. That concludes that concludes public comment as a sign. Oh, yeah. Okay. Here we go. That concludes public comment. And we do have Councilman Austin who has some comments.\nSpeaker 9: I did. Just just to clarify for clarification purposes. And following up on a public speaker, the the comment. Can you city attorney once again define what a nuisance site is or would be considered to be?\nSpeaker 16: Certainly in the in the nuisance, this ordinance is trying not to close them, but to make sure that they are in conformance and not creating a nuisance. And in the event, for example, of drug related arrests at the location or excessive calls for service by the police department for services, it could be deemed a nuisance hotel. And if it is deemed a nuisance hotel, then the that business should shall retain its license only if it conforms to a series of and there are 22 requirements that they have to do in order to make that hotel a non nuisance hotel and maintain their license. So it's it's a combination of calls for service and complaints from the community that we're trying to address by this ordinance.\nSpeaker 9: So. And I just want to ensure that that, you know, we're we're being fair here and understanding that, you know, one or two complaints from. One person is not, you know, used as a trigger to to a nuisance.\nSpeaker 16: That's absolutely correct.\nSpeaker 9: Okay. So I just want to clarify that, because I know I had a few people reach out to me after our last meeting. Just just for clarification on that. That's why I asked the question. I'll be supporting the item. But again, I want to make sure that we are not deeming every motel in the city as a nuisance property. Just just those specific ones. And I know we had a list of when we we looked at the study to begin with, there was a list of of specific sites that that that caused this or created this this ordinance. So. Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 15: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Just want to speak in support of this. You know, staff done a good job. It's been a long time coming. We know the issues. We know the hotels. We know we. This gives us the definition of what a nuisance motel is. It helps add clarity, set some standards, and and it's going to have an overall impact on the quality of life in every neighborhood. So we're really proud that this has come forward. And thank you. Can I support this?\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. There's a motion and a second. No other public comment. So please, let's do the roll call vote. District one. Yet true to. District four. Yes. District six, seven, eight and nine. District nine.\nSpeaker 12: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That is six votes. That concludes the regular agenda. And so that's the I believe it's the last item. We do have some additional comment, but that is the last item 31. Is that right? Madam Quirk. Great. I do have three speakers I want to invite to please to please come forward a Cathy item.","label":1}

{"text":"This is a talk about sugar and cancer. I became interested in sugar when I was in college. Not this kind of sugar. It was the sugar that our biology professors taught us about in the context of the coating of your cells. Maybe you didn't know that your cells are coated with sugar. And I didn't know that, either, until I took these courses in college, but back then \u2014 and this was in, let's just call it the 1980s \u2014 people didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar. And when I dug through my notes, what I noticed I had written down is that the sugar coating on our cells is like the sugar coating on a peanut M and M. And people thought the sugar coating on our cells was like a protective coating that somehow made our cells stronger or tougher. But we now know, many decades later, that it's much more complicated than that, and that the sugars on our cells are actually very complex. And if you could shrink yourself down to a little miniature airplane and fly right along the surface of your cells, it might look something like this \u2014 with geographical features. And now, the complex sugars are these trees and bushes \u2014 weeping willows that are swaying in the wind and moving with the waves. And when I started thinking about all these complex sugars that are like this foliage on our cells, it became one of the most interesting problems that I encountered as a biologist and also as a chemist. And so now we tend to think about the sugars that are populating the surface of our cells as a language. They have a lot of information stored in their complex structures. But what are they trying to tell us? I can tell you that we do know some information that comes from these sugars, and it's turned out already to be incredibly important in the world of medicine. For example, one thing your sugars are telling us is your blood type. So your blood cells, your red blood cells, are coated with sugars, and the chemical structures of those sugars determine your blood type. So for example, I know that I am blood type O. How many people are also blood type O? Put your hands up. It's a pretty common one, so when so few hands go up, either you're not paying attention or you don't know your blood type, and both of those are bad. (Laughter) But for those of you who share the blood type O with me, what this means is that we have this chemical structure on the surface of our blood cells: three simple sugars linked together to make a more complex sugar. And that, by definition, is blood type O. Now, how many people are blood type A? Right here. That means you have an enzyme in your cells that adds one more building block, that red sugar, to build a more complex structure. And how many people are blood type B? Quite a few. You have a slightly different enzyme than the A people, so you build a slightly different structure, and those of you that are AB have the enzyme from your mother, the other enzyme from your father, and now you make both of these structures in roughly equal proportions. And when this was figured out, which is now back in the previous century, this enabled one of the most important medical procedures in the world, which, of course, is the blood transfusion. And by knowing what your blood type is, we can make sure, if you ever need a transfusion, that your donor has the same blood type, so that your body doesn't see foreign sugars, which it wouldn't like and would certainly reject. What else are the sugars on the surface of your cells trying to tell us? Well, those sugars might be telling us that you have cancer. So a few decades ago, correlations began to emerge from the analysis of tumor tissue. And the typical scenario is a patient would have a tumor detected, and the tissue would be removed in a biopsy procedure and then sent down to a pathology lab where that tissue would be analyzed to look for chemical changes that might inform the oncologist about the best course of treatment. And what was discovered from studies like that is that the sugars have changed when the cell transforms from being healthy to being sick. And those correlations have come up again and again and again. But a big question in the field has been: Why? Why do cancers have different sugars? What's the importance of that? Why does it happen, and what can we do about it if it does turn out to be related to the disease process? So, one of the changes that we study is an increase in the density of a particular sugar that's called sialic acid. And I think this is going to be one of the most important sugars of our times, so I would encourage everybody to get familiar with this word. Sialic acid is not the kind of sugar that we eat. Those are different sugars. This is a kind of sugar that is actually found at certain levels on all of the cells in your body. It's actually quite common on your cells. But for some reason, cancer cells, at least in a successful, progressive disease, tend to have more sialic acid than a normal, healthy cell would have. And why? What does that mean? Well, what we've learned is that it has to do with your immune system. So let me tell you a little bit about the importance of your immune system in cancer. And this is something that's, I think, in the news a lot these days. You know, people are starting to become familiar with the term \"cancer immune therapy.\" And some of you might even know people who are benefiting from these very new ways of treating cancer. What we now know is that your immune cells, which are the white blood cells coursing through your bloodstream, protect you on a daily basis from things gone bad \u2014 including cancer. And so in this picture, those little green balls are your immune cells, and that big pink cell is a cancer cell. And these immune cells go around and taste all the cells in your body. That's their job. And most of the time, the cells taste OK. But once in a while, a cell might taste bad. Hopefully, that's the cancer cell, and when those immune cells get the bad taste, they launch an all-out strike and kill those cells. So we know that. We also know that if you can potentiate that tasting, if you can encourage those immune cells to actually take a big old bite out of a cancer cell, you get a better job protecting yourself from cancer every day and maybe even curing a cancer. And there are now a couple of drugs out there in the market that are used to treat cancer patients that act exactly by this process. They activate the immune system so that the immune system can be more vigorous in protecting us from cancer. In fact, one of those drugs may well have spared President Jimmy Carter's life. Do you remember, President Carter had malignant melanoma that had metastasized to his brain, and that diagnosis is one that is usually accompanied by numbers like \"months to live.\" But he was treated with one of these new immune-stimulating drugs, and now his melanoma appears to be in remission, which is remarkable, considering the situation only a few years ago. In fact, it's so remarkable that provocative statements like this one: \"Cancer is having a penicillin moment,\" people are saying, with these new immune therapy drugs. I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing to say about a disease which we've been fighting for a long time and mostly losing the battle with. So this is very exciting. Now what does this have to do with sugars? Well, I'll tell you what we've learned. When an immune cell snuggles up against a cancer cell to take a taste, it's looking for signs of disease, and if it finds those signs, the cell gets activated and it launches a missile strike and kills the cell. But if that cancer cell has a dense forest of that sugar, sialic acid, well, it starts to taste pretty good. And there's a protein on immune cells that grabs the sialic acid, and if that protein gets held at that synapse between the immune cell and the cancer cell, it puts that immune cell to sleep. The sialic acids are telling the immune cell, \"Hey, this cell's all right. Nothing to see here, move along. Look somewhere else.\" So in other words, as long as our cells are wearing a thick coat of sialic acid, they look fabulous, right? It's amazing. And what if you could strip off that coat and take that sugar away? Well, your immune system might be able to see that cancer cell for what it really is: something that needs to be destroyed. And so this is what we're doing in my lab. We're developing new medicines that are basically cell-surface lawnmowers \u2014 molecules that go down to the surface of these cancer cells and just cut off those sialic acids, so that the immune system can reach its full potential in eliminating those cancer cells from our body. So in closing, let me just remind you again: your cells are coated with sugars. The sugars are telling cells around that cell whether the cell is good or bad. And that's important, because our immune system needs to leave the good cells alone. Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases. But once in a while, cancers get the ability to express these new sugars. And now that we understand how those sugars mesmerize the immune system, we can come up with new medicines to wake up those immune cells, tell them, \"Ignore the sugars, eat the cell and have a delicious snack, on cancer.\" Thank you.

{"text":"Speaker 1: Thank you are hearing I remember to.\nSpeaker 2: Report from economic development recommendation received supporting documentation into the record conclude the public hearing regarding an economic subsidy in connection with revised transient occupancy tax sharing agreement with American life, and authorize the city manager to execute the First Amendment to the purchase and Sale Agreement. Attaching a revised transient occupancy tax sharing agreement for the property located at 100 East Ocean Boulevard District to.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. We will just begin by doing this staff report, please. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Our staff report will be given by John Keisler, our director of economic development. Honorable man.\nSpeaker 9: Members of the city council. I'm happy to bring to you tonight an update on an agreement for vacant property located at 100 East Ocean Boulevard, popularly known as the Jurgens Trust Building. This building was built in 1919, but demolished by private property owners in 1988 and purchased by a redevelopment agency in 2011. It was designated for future development in the Long Range Property Management Plan, and in 2015 the city issued a request for proposals for the purchase and development of this site. The proposal that was chosen was from American Life Hotel Developer and located in Seattle, Washington, for the purchase price of $7 million. Also executed at the time of the purchase and sale agreement with a transient occupancy tax sharing agreement authorized by the City Council on May 17th, 2016 as part of the original purchase and sale agreement. There were a few conditions prior to the transfer of ownership, which included an executed contract with a nationally recognized hotel operator for star or equivalent designation. Fully executed project labor agreement between the buyer and the L.A. Orange County Building, Construction Trades Council, and evidence that the hotel operator had agreed to participate in a card check neutrality agreement for the hotel, not including the restaurant. And the original Transient Occupancy Sharing Agreement was based on an analysis for a 350 Room four star $165 million project, which established a $47 million feasibility gap and verified by a third party review. The projected $54 million in total transient occupancy tax that would be generated over 20 years was determined to be shared 5050. Over that 20 year period between the city and the buyer, the developer, which would be approximately 27 million for for both the buyer and the city. What we have since that time that occurred are a number of changes, including a 2016 lawsuit that was filed by the Citizens Against Downtown Long Beach giveaways, ultimately that the court ruled in favor of the city and a petition for writ of mandate was denied in 2017. And also changes in the market costs for labor construction materials and financing had grown over this period of time and to to make the project work. The design was increased from 350 rooms to 417 rooms, with the construction costs increasing from 165 to $262 million to complete the project. Since that time, we've conducted a new economic feasibility gap analysis and established that the gap was now $61 million. And we verified that with our third party financial consultant, Kaiser Marston and Associates. So what we have for you tonight is a revised transient occupancy tax sharing agreement. The purpose of this agreement is to address the feasibility gap by restructuring the timing of the total sharing in this new amendment. The buyer would share up to 80% or approximately 27 million, the same amount from the original agreement. But they would be reimbursed in the first nine years rather than over a 20 year period. The city in the new agreement would receive 20% or approximately $7 million of the TOT over the first nine years, and then at year ten would start begin to receive 100% of the TOT generated from the project starting at about $4 million a year and reaching over $6 million a year by year 20. As part of this new agreement, the developer has committed to a minimum investment of $230 million to receive the full benefit of the TOT sharing agreement. And the agreement would continue to remain in effect for 20 years. There's a number of other benefits of the revised TOT sharing agreement. The project will be much bigger, as we mentioned, creating more jobs for both the construction project as well as for ongoing operations. Construction jobs are estimated to be 1700 for this project in ongoing operations. The estimated job creation will be 360 ongoing jobs in the downtown. The new project will include more amenities, which will create more sales tax and jobs than the original project. The cost of the project going from 165 to 262 million are almost $626,000 per roomkey will result in a greater economic impact for the city. It will require this minimum of $230 million in investment, which was not a part of the original agreement. It will command higher average daily room rates estimated to be over $220 per night, which will generate both. Higher wages and more transient occupancy tax to the city. And the developer has also agreed to include worker safety improvements such as panic buttons, to make sure that we have a safe working environment in our hotels, as well as a good faith effort to identify a local restaurant operator if a third party operator is chosen for the restaurant itself. I wanted to give you a quick estimate on the on the timeline. If we do have an approved agreement amendment, I'm sorry, and the buyer would begin the process of securing entitlements, as well as a card check neutrality agreement in a hotel operator agreement in 2018. There would also be a play or a project labor agreement for construction in 2018, and if all the permits, entitlements, environmental review and agreements are presented to the city, we would approve the transfer of the asset and begin construction in 2019 with a grand opening estimated for 2021. And just to conclude, the existing agreement that is in place that the City Council approved last year.\nSpeaker 1: Already requires.\nSpeaker 9: The project labor agreement and a card check neutrality agreement before the property could ever be conveyed or escrow could be closed. The amendment maintains these requirements and the transfer of property will not occur until these requirements are satisfied with that. I would like to conclude my report and answer any questions.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. Thank you for the update. And just to want to clarify, and I'm going to go ahead and go to the Council on the public. So, Mr. City Attorney, I know that this was mentioned briefly by Mr. Keisler, but get both the former proposal as well as this proposal of Mr. City. And if you can just clarify this piece, they both contain both a project labor agreement, a full project labor agreement on the site, as well as a contract agreement on the site as well. Is that correct? That's correct. And is it correct also that the the support from the city in our commitment financially to this project would not happen and this project is not eligible for those funds? When we close this deal months out, unless both the contract agreement and the project labor agreement were in place, is that correct? If I understand your statement correctly, we we do not have to close unless those items that you indicated occur. That's correct. And that's part of the agreement is for those items to be included. The transfer would not occur. Okay. Excellent. Thank you very much. Want to just reiterate that. So I appreciate that. And with that, let me go to you. There's a there's a motion on the floor, Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Great. Thank you. I want to thank you for clarifying. I want to thank staff for their incredible work. And I want to highlight a couple of things with this project. This is the first hotel project in my district that's been on city land that I will be participating in approving, possibly just want to keep my options open here. I want to make sure that we highlight some things that have changed in the process. Never before has everybody really had a seat at the table in creating a what we're not calling, but what is essentially a community benefits agreement where we're hearing from all the Labor Party's as a city and it's not the city's job to negotiate those Labor contracts, but the city ushering through best practices to try to make sure everybody is at the table. And so I want to applaud staff for forming a relationship with Unite Here Local 11, where they have not had that before. I also know that we've had a lot of outreach from other stakeholders and different issues pertaining to local hire piece and a couple other components. I have a couple of questions, then I want to go to public comments and then hear from my colleagues. I know vice mayor has to leave, so if we could hear from vice mayor and the public comment and then behind the rail, I think it would be helpful. The city attorney I have a my first question is you you stated that we do not have to.\nSpeaker 3: Approve.\nSpeaker 4: The ask the land sale if those things are not met. But is it a requirement that we have to? Have those.\nSpeaker 0: In place.\nSpeaker 1: Mayor and members of City Council. Assuming I understand your question correctly. No, it's not a requirement. There's the possibility that the failure of a condition could be waived by the city and the closing could proceed without a card check agreement or without a labor peace agreement. But I think, as you just heard staff publicly say.\nSpeaker 9: That's not their intention. And I don't.\nSpeaker 1: Think they would ever do that without seeking further clarification or guidance from council. But it's theoretically possible.\nSpeaker 4: Theoretically possible. But we could say tonight that if something were to happen, it would need to come back to council. We could ask for that tonight.\nSpeaker 1: That's correct.\nSpeaker 3: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: You could make it so that those two conditions there, they are described in section.\nSpeaker 9: 3.2 H and I of the current.\nSpeaker 1: Agreement that those conditions are not waive able by the city.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you for that. I also wanted to clarify in the communication we've received this morning, it has the Los Angeles Orange County Buildings Trading and Construction Trades Council is outlined under 3.2 H under 3.2. I'm assuming I it just says that there's a card check neutrality agreement. So tonight we could put in there that that needs to be done with unite not here local 11 I'm assuming.\nSpeaker 1: Well no I think the card check neutrality agreement, the idea is that it needs to be executed by the hotel management company. Right. And then I'm not a labor law expert, but my understanding is that the that the employees could opt to unionize or not and become part of whatever union they might choose to. It may well be that unite here 11 is the one they would, but I don't think legally they're required to.\nSpeaker 4: All right. Thank you for those questions. I'd like to hear from my colleague and then hear from the public, please.\nSpeaker 1: Councilman Richardson. Thanks. So I do have a hard stop at 630. It's my daughter's first Christmas show tonight. But I wanted to. I'm already late, so I wanted to just chime in and just say this is a very important project. And I was here when the first agreement went through, and I remember hearing from the parties, you know, everyone hasn't seen that corner and wonder what the city of Long Beach is going to do with that corner. It's really important. It's going to be a tremendous success. My comments last time that came around are the same when we want to make sure that there's, you know, that that, you know, I congratulate there's a project labor agreement and it's great to hear that the 1700 quality jobs are going to be created through this process. And I hear the commitment to the commitment to labor peace for the ongoing operations. I just think that's the way that we go moving forward. So I wanted to express my support here and also acknowledge the president of the school board. Well, both the president, the school board and Dr. Feldman Williams, school board member. I won't be here for your recognition tonight, but I just wanted to acknowledge before I have to take off. But thank you and express my support here. But unfortunately I won't. Given how long the last item went, likely this will go for another hour. I won't be here for that. Thank you. And thank you for that moment, Jenny. Thank you. Okay. So, Councilmember Pearce, you want to go to the public comment, is that correct? Yes. Okay. So we're going to go now on to public comment on this item. So please come forward if you have a comment on this item. I'll go first. Ron Miller, executive secretary of the L.A. Orange County Building Trades. Really appreciate the partnership here. We do know this developer. We've done agreements in the past with him in Los Angeles. They've been very successful agreements with both the building trades and the hotel workers. You can go over to Olympic Boulevard and see a see the hotel there. And it's been very successful, put a lot of folks to work, create a lot of new careers and should be good. We'll have local hire just like we have on all the other projects in Long Beach and moving forward with more success. I did get a thing from a researcher today in my office that through Long Beach City College we put numerous people through our apprenticeship readiness program. The latest numbers I got, we've put 50 people into careers, into apprenticeships in the building trades. 16% of those 50 are women, 16% are African-American. And so it's a good success. We're building on this project. It's going to be something to help us go further. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Shirley. So with respect to this hotel and I'm sure that each council councilperson representing the homeless in your district, you know who they are. You you talk to them, that you meet with them regularly and they have access to you as your more affluent constituents. The Seaport Marina closed, and a lot of those people who were using vouchers to live there are now without a place. Some of them lined PCH and Second Street. When you're allowing businesses, particularly coming into the state or other cities to operate here.\nSpeaker 1: Other cities are building.\nSpeaker 3: Now, building in to the base. Knowing that they need to do more for their homeless clients, building it in so that somewhere in there the working homeless I'm not talking about the dirty, sloppy one that you don't want to shake their hand. Their teeth is green and creamy. Their clothes look like they haven't bathed in 12 years. I'm not saying that homeless. I'm saying the working homeless person who. You wouldn't even recognize that they were that. But they're sleeping in their car, some of them. What if we built in? And I know it might be a little too late for this hotel? What if we bought into the coming forward so that vouchers can be accepted for those who may or may not be able to afford the $700 a night a night fee for that hotel? But, hmm. If you say to the business coming in, you know, we're trying to work with our homeless community. Oh, we want to rename them to not homeless, but people without housing. Possibly you can build that in so that, who knows, they may be able to reside there. The statement going Long Beach kept ringing in my ears last week and I laughed every time it was coming up. Go, go. Long Beach. Well, we go in with the homeless. What creative ideas are you thinking moving forward? Or are.\nSpeaker 1: You only.\nSpeaker 3: Sticking to the letter of the law that other cities are doing? Where the home is going with you. They think.\nSpeaker 1: They're going to go if there's nothing more.\nSpeaker 3: Than.\nSpeaker 1: Around the.\nSpeaker 3: Corner and back. They're going with you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. Speaker, please. But even they are seeing a fellow concern in the city staff in the public as here today. I just wanted to recognize the brothers and sisters that's here to support this idea item moving forward. IBEW folks there living here in Long Beach that wants to support good projects like this moving forward. I can tell you that the track record that American Life has is a really good track record in L.A. City, L.A. They've done a project under a project agreement in Seattle. I spoke with our our sister local union there, Local 46, which represent IBEW members out there. And they've implemented project labor agreements under American lives projects out there. So they have they do have a good track record on utilizing place and in the benefits that come with it. I urge the city council to move forward with this item. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you for coming out next speaker, please. Very good. What I am going to impart here, I was going to impart also. On two other items on another agenda. But the same principle applies regardless of what regardless of what project we're entering into. I think the city should adopt as a policy. If before they enter into an agreement and sign the agreement, they must secure from the company. No matter who it is. A letter that states and discloses. Any. Financial. Embezzlement. Crimes. That they had their companies had been involved in. Like we discovered after after after we signed the contract for was a near near $10 million for the parking structure used in parking lots. And we found those people, you know, they came here like flies on garbage. They know where the you know, they know where the corrupt is or are. So I think it you adopt it for this cup and I, I the building certainly we need to rebuild that. But let's make sure. And I know nothing about this company that you do your due diligence, see how many, if any, have been convicted of crimes. And had them just you sign the agreement in saying that if if. It's later discovered. That you didn't do due diligence and they in fact, were convicted of the crimes such as the person is such as a company who signed the contract with the market like did then. The contract is null and void, period. Not only that, the city would get any money back. That they spent. Having to deal with this company. Thank you. And my apologies to the company. I know nothing about you, but I do know some of the people here in this city and on the city council. We have a great many that are honest. Unfortunately, that's not 100%. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. next speaker, please. Good evening. Warmed Lisowski Long Beach Citizens for Fair Development with a group that brought the original litigation and have a pending appeal. I applaud my union brothers and sisters for trying to get this developer to sign some type of labor agreement. But as you could see, the answer to council person's second district's question was that, no, they can still buy the property without your union agreement. So I urge the union to if you see how fast these buildings go up these days, you really are only going to have about two months of work there. You should be looking for longer term sustainable jobs in the in a renewable energy sector. The city is still arguing that this is not a project council person papers, not a project. And as you can see, they have selected a developer. They have selected hotel brands. And this most certainly is a project. In fact, if you look on tonight's agenda, the address is not even on the agenda item number. So who was trying to pull a fast one and not even alert the community that there was a hearing on 100 East Ocean today? The transient occupancy, occupancy, tax sharing agreement, it's kind of become a frank agreement. I don't think even people behind the days understand what's going into this agreement. If the gap all of a sudden has expanded to 61 million, how is the same $27 million going to cover that gap? It just doesn't quite make sense. And so we also take objection with the fact that in the staff report, the staff gave our organization an incredible amount of power, saying that delays caused by our lawsuit , where we were merely asking the city to follow, secure the law, just merely holding the city to account, to follow the laws that that other cities make their developers follow. And then use this to speed up the rate at which the developer gets their $27 million tax rebate. So we support development in the city, but we support development with local developers that have a benefit to the community. This is an out-of-town developer that is just giving some lip service to the labor movement. And this project does not help the residents of Long Beach. Thank you. Thank you. Next speaker, please.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is Rita moreno. I been a hotel worker in the city for four years now. I live in the ninth district. I'm here on behalf of the hospitality workers of Long Beach. I have.\nSpeaker 4: To oppose American lives proposal.\nSpeaker 3: To restructure the existing tax sharing agreement with the city. We believe this would set a bad precedent for the city's upcoming conversations.\nSpeaker 4: Of studies of the city wide tax initiative policy for hotels.\nSpeaker 3: We also we are also here to tell the city council that we oppose broader tax initiative policy that carries the intent of subsidizing future hotel development near the city, near the city center, without any assurance that the working families of Long Beach like mine have tangible benefits, either as our city hotel industry continues to grow. We, the hotel workers of Long Beach are a reminder, are reminding our mayor and the Council that it is your duty to protect us, all of your working people, not just the businesses we hope to. We hope that the mayor and the council respect other workers and and the community. You call to put people over profit. Profit. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is Rachel Smith. I currently work in and formerly resided in the first district. I'm here to oppose American Life's proposal to restructure the existing tax sharing agreement with the city, because we do not know how this may impact a potential.\nSpeaker 6: Citywide incentive policy.\nSpeaker 3: I'm also here to tell the city to tell the city council that I oppose a broader tax incentive policy that carries the intent of subsidizing.\nSpeaker 6: Future hotel.\nSpeaker 3: Development near the city center without any reassurance that workers in Long Beach will have tangible benefits and protections in hotel. Workers are the backbone of Long Beach tourism industry. Working women of color make up more than half of all hotel workers in Long Beach. In my experience, as time goes on, workers see an increase in workload and consequently an increase in injury rates. I call on the mayor and the city council to prioritize working families, not only business. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. Speaker, please.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. My name is one. I'm a lawyer. I am a hotel housekeeper here in Long Beach. Last week, Time magazine feature me as proud a group of women called The Silence Breaker, and we were named Time's Person of the Year 2017. It was an honor to me to be included with a brave woman, a man who came forward publicly against sexual harassment at all economy levels. For years, I have been fighting for the rights of women working in the hotel industry. After. After I decided that I was tired of being harassed, ignored, abused, and that I will fight back. I am so proud of this moment where women everywhere are standing against abuse. But I'm.\nSpeaker 6: Here tonight to condemn.\nSpeaker 3: The actions of the city council. They have failed the woman or this city. Mayor Garcia and Council members Pryce, Huston, Mango, Soprano and Andrew in known our pleas to heal and instead fight with the rich hotel company who profit off our exploitation. Tonight, Austin in Price will propose an investment policy for city employees just a month after they deny one for hotel workers. I said to my male Garcia will promise them a new hotel, a bellman requiring the company to do nothing about the abuse its workers will no doubt face. I know this because I have to spend my life, my life cleaning hotel rooms, save them by breaking what that fell foul me honorable to predators who too often are protected by the fact that they are also paying customers like so many other women in the Long Beach hotel industry. How come? For what we know with my story, to demand that the theory is stand with women I think are being ignored by councils that spend more time talking about giving away millions of dollars to hotel developers than that it does about protecting hotel workers from an abuse. The honor of being named Time's Person of the Year is an honor that should be shared with the entire city. Long Beach. But as it is, then, that person that the year awards show the hypocrisy of a city council who will rather have us stay quiet and suffer in silence. I am here tonight to tell you. We won't stay quiet. We will persist. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much. Go ahead, sir. Good evening. My name is Andrew Mayorga. I'm a representative of Laguna Local 39, representing our membership. I just want to. I just came here in support of this project, and I'm glad I was at the end of the line. I heard a lot of negative stuff. Let's just start with first. You know, American life doesn't just give lip service, say they came. And wherever they build, they build with the community. They outreach to the community. They come to individuals like myself and my brothers back here. So to sit here and say that they give nothing but lip service to us or to you as homeless, an insult. I know wherever they go, they reach out. I probably share that. There's developers here in Long Beach that are building right now that have never once approached anybody from our community to come help them put a shovel in the ground. But that's on a separate note. And again, to address something else that I heard tonight, and just for the young lady, I think started all this conversation about how the council doesn't do anything to help the homeless when projects like this come. I just want you guys know that's not true. Through projects like this and agreements through plays, I've come across many of our membership that started out in their cars and now live in apartments are on their pathways to owning homes, on cars, new cars and on their end are starting families. And that's because of people like you, people like American life and my brothers and sisters back here that we tend to build things. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Next speaker, please. I just have a point of clarification because I'm confused is like the agreement, essentially the company is going to pay the city a lump sum and then over nine years they're going to get money back from the tax cut of the taxes because I know resort tax from Palm Springs where I'm from like goes entirely to the city to fund like all of our special projects and social projects. So I just I'm curious about that, like to understand how like are they getting all the money that they paid the city back in that nine years? So they're breaking even and then we're going to start getting our money. And then with subsidizing like developments like a hotel, wouldn't American Life Inc be, like, big enough to be able to support itself and not need a subsidy when developers like like local real estate developers that are trying to build, like, low income homes for people that already need it because we have a population problem already. So to bring in like a hotel. Yeah, we have we have conventions all the time, but we have plenty of hotel space for those conventions already. As it is, we need more housing subsidy. So I'm just wondering. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Next speaker, please. Good evening, Council. My name is Max Norris. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak today. Following Councilwoman Pierce's line of questioning, I can assume that she's likely to make an amendment to require the play conditions as well as the card check and hopefully as well the safety call buttons as a matter of condition for the the passing of the transfer of the land between the city and American life or whatever this company is called. I would just want to point out that without that amendment, this is simply just a lip service to the trends of the week. The hashtag of the week, the TIME Magazine article. You know what? You guys all turned your back on a couple of weeks ago. So without an amendment like that, this is nothing, obviously. My. My brother's in labor, and the trades will get their play. It's coming quick, and the trades will make sure it happens. But on the back end, without assurances by amendment, as I assume Mr. Pearce will introduce shortly, this is nothing, this is nothing at all for the hotel workers or for the rest of Long Beach because those 7000 jobs will be gone. And as important as they are and and I do think that they are important, those jobs aren't going to go anywhere by adding that amendment. Thank you. Thank you, Nick. Speaker, please. The last speaker speaker's list is now closed. Good evening, honorable mayor, honorable council members. My name is Greg Steinhauer, president of American Life. I thought I would come up here and you could hear directly from my mouth. So, as you know, we're under a purchase and sale agreement to buy the property. And in the earlier agreement, we have agreed to sign a card check agreement with the unions. We will commit to that. We have committed to signing the project labor agreement with the unions. We've always had excellent relationship with the labor unions. We have excellent relationships with Unite here up in Seattle. But for some reason there seems to be an issue down here. I don't know why that is. The but we're not going to sign the card check agreement until we have a flag in place. It's just that simple. It makes no sense to do that from our standpoint until we have an operator for the hotel, which we hope we'll be able to announce in the first quarter of 2018. John ran through all the economics of the proposal. One other point that was not made, and that is by changing the structure of the proposal and reducing the length the city actually benefits to a tune of over $6 million that receives $6 million more during that time period than had we stuck with the original agreement. It's just as the hotel's gotten bigger. These projects, hotel developments, a cyclical type of development. There is no assurances that when you come online, there's going to be a market. And this is a way to help mitigate the risks so that we can and make this investment and create jobs for everybody. These projects take between 24 and 30 months to build. That's a lot of construction work. And I appreciate your reconsidering this from from my view. Where I sit, I see no issue and we will honor our word. Thank you for your time. Thank you very much. Kim he was the last public speaker. Mr. Pete. I called last public speaker. So I will, sir. Yes, I called last of the speaker already. You want anyone in the audience? I will let you speak because for public comment, please be quick. We all recall that public speaker. Go ahead, sir. Quick. So I don't get the whole 3 minutes, so I actually don't even have to let you speak because I recall. Come Speaker said be quick, but go ahead, sir. Up there. Go ahead. So you told me I'm getting I'm just saying out of respect, but you can go ahead. Speak. Quick, 3 minutes. Quick. Yeah. So as far as you know, hey, I wouldn't even come up here, but let me switch this out. And so I want you to go come on up here. But the lady the young lady spoke and it sounds like she was making threats, like, oh, well, well, they always giving funds to the hotel. You're supposed to put funds to the hotel. The Americans. She only she can speak English. She's up here reading off of a paper, you know? Sir, could you please address the issue? Can you please address the issue? If you believe? Because check this out. You know what? Check that 8834 B of the penal code is about citizen's arrest. Hey, watch your threats. I organize a brother service officer, you know, stay on topic. We're. I'm telling you. 834 B.S. And I'm not shy about it. I'm not having that. This ain't going down in America having non-Americans threatening Americans. You American men and I don't give a damn about. Hey, sir, you know that. You know, you have to stay on topic. Topic? No, you're out. I'm talking about the lady with you. Go ahead, sir. I'm going. You didn't tell her she was off topic about threatening Americans, did you? Go ahead, sir. You did. You did you hold on second to the public as as as reprehensible as what's being said. But this is he has a he has a right to say it. So continue. Yeah, yeah. Oh, shut up, sir. Anyway, address me. Thank you. Well, okay, you could take that too, but check this out. Hey, the thing is, is America for Americans? Okay, and when we up here, I like to see it as such. I don't know. I'm 53 years old. I ain't never seen it like this to where a non American could come with a threat towards an American. Hey, I don't know. We ain't having that. I know some yoga don't turn into snowflakes and got sore but we ain't no snowflakes in this side Are we going to melt the snowflakes? Snowflakes melt and they're going to get dealt with just like just like all the people again dealt with now for what they did earlier. So back to this issue no more non Americans then we're gonna deal with your own non Americans think you got something going that ain't being forgotten and all of them sorry people this with you so that's a warning. That's it. Trump is running the stuff in the United States. Amen. John, thank you. So public comment is now over and now we're going to back to the council. So public comment is over. Thank you very much. So we'll start off with Councilman Pearce.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mayor, and thank you to all the speakers that spoke tonight. I do want to give a little bit of context and a little bit of my background. When I first came to Long Beach and I first started volunteering, it was before the release of The Tale of Two Cities, which Gary Heidrich, who was wrote the foreword for that, is actually here. And what came out of that study was that we had given $1,000,000,000 of subsidies to our downtown tourism industry, and we've done that with zero strings attached. We did that without asking for a play, without asking for a card check, without asking for environmental protections, without any strings attached at all. One hotel rent free for ten years on city land. And so for me being here tonight, talking about this tonight, it's been a challenge for me in looking at what the ideal situation would be. Would I like to have things signed in front of me and a guarantee? Yes, I would. Do I have faith in the process and the commitment from developers, from labor, from the community members that we're going to have a fair process in the end? I do. And I do want to hear from my council colleagues, but I would like to make some amendments to guarantee us some of that process. So I just really want to make sure that those folks in the audience and at home recognize that having a community benefit agreement that's going to be comprehensive. It's the first time we've done this with the hotel development in our downtown. I'm going to go ahead and list the amendments that I'd like to make. And so city attorney, if you don't mind. And then do you want to do the play stuff for the requirement? Okay. So first, I just want to clarify on you. Make sure I read it right. I want to make sure that we do amend Section 3.2 to require council review before finalizing the sale. As I had asked previously of our city attorney's office, it's a requirement. And so I want to make sure that we do ensure that it comes back to this body before a sale is final made.\nSpeaker 1: You can require that. That's not what I understood you to ask earlier. When we had our discussion, I thought that you were seeking the city would not be able to waive requirements three to H and three to I. It would only come back before you if the city proposed to waive either one of those. But if they do not waive them and there is a labor peace agreement and there is a carbon neutrality agreement, then we would close without coming back to council.\nSpeaker 4: So only if there is a request for a waiver would I like it to come back. Perfect. To be clear, I would also wouldn't mind having a report after that sale is done, a staff report just given to the council so we know where we're at on the process. I would like for the restaurant peace. It's one thing that I've always talked about. I think that our downtown is an amazing downtown and we have that balance in between some corporate businesses and some local businesses. And we tend to be a fantastic place where we've got things like the chocolate place and the juice place. And so wanting to take an opportunity on the corner of Pine and Ocean to celebrate a local restaurant. Should there be a third party restaurant operator? Just clarifying that the developer would work with the Economic Development Department to identify a Long Beach restaurant for that operator if it is a third party operator. So I wanted to make sure that was clear on the record because in the report it just kind of lays it out. Lucy For the workers safety, as you know, as some people brought up today, it is not a it weighs heavy on me that we had a very lengthy meeting about Claudia's law and a two weeks later we had an agenda item around giving a subsidy to a hotel. And so it does weigh on me, and it is an opportunity for us to highlight a developer that's saying, hey, we're going to do it voluntarily without even it being part of a labor contract, but we're willing to do that. And so I do want to lift up the specifics for me that are important. As I raised at the last council meeting, we talked about this, that the developer has agreed to have panic buttons. I would like to clarify that these panic buttons be given to each hotel employee assigned to working in a guest room without another hotel employee at no cost to the hotel employee. And that panic button should be able to communicate with security, not simply be a noisemaker like a whistle that could only be heard on one floor. I'd also like to include establishing a process for the employees to notify their employer about unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual conduct or other verbal or physical contact, which is typically included in a personnel file or not file but protocols. But just wanted to make sure that we highlight that there's a process where an employee has an opportunity to step out and do that. Those are the changes that I would like to have included as a requirement for this. And these are changes that I've had conversations with our developer on. And so I now ask my council colleagues to support this motion to approve this total restructuring. The benefits to the study are great. Adding the additional rooms is fantastic for our bottom line and having a developer that's willing to do more than just sign a card check agreement or labor peace is the right choice for us in this city. So thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Mayor. May we clarify a couple of the amendments? Sure. Councilmember. Councilmember Pearce, as the deputy city attorney that will be tasked with drafting the amendment, I want to.\nSpeaker 9: Just bring to your attention to things that might be difficult and ask for clarification. The first two conditions.\nSpeaker 1: I think are clear. The first of which is that the three two age and 3 to 1 cannot be waived without coming back here. I think it's also pretty simple to include a requirement that the panic buttons or providing immediate contact with security be included for all workers. The other two are you requiring that the any restaurant be locally owned, or is it best effort to.\nSpeaker 4: Best effort with working with our economic development team? If it is a third party. Okay. So it's only if it's a third party and working with them to identify and it's a best effort.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Thank you. And then lastly, the it had to do with the employment policies with respect to reporting. That gets into quite a bit of detail. Can you provide me with more?\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, it's not actually reporting. It's just making sure that there's an employee process in place for which the hotel employee notifies the employer, the operator, about unwanted sexual advances, and that they have time on the clock to do that, which is pretty standard in every H.R. policy. But I wanted to make sure we lifted that up because we have had so many issues around sexual assault in the industry.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, great. Thank you. I can certainly draft it that way. If if it's okay with staff and the council, I can do that.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you. Councilwoman Gonzalez.\nSpeaker 2: Yes. I want to thank city staff as well. And I know the developer. Gregory spoke with him earlier today, as well as our building trades and unite here. Who is here as well. I think this was a very good collaborative effort and Councilmember Pearce brought forward a lot of great items that I know she worked behind the scenes on to make sure we got it right, not just for any city, but for a long beach. And as we know, we try to do things very customized here in the city. And I think this was a really good example of what we could do when we all worked together. And for me, I think, you know, seeing that the average hotel investment, hotel unit investment will be $630,000, give or take. We're right now at about an average of 350 to $400000 of investment per unit of hotel speaks volumes to where the city is headed. And with that, I really am appreciative that we have these benefits for our community that will come back with all that investment. So absolutely ensuring that there is a project labor agreement, that's something that my office authored a few years back with a few of my council colleagues here that embeds in that 40% of our of the workers on site will be local hire. And we'll we'll certainly do everything that it takes to get to that target. And then 10% of the workforce on that specific project will be disadvantaged workers. What's exciting about that is that we know that, like I said, it's an all encompassing project that will include the workforce as well as great development. And I have done some research on American life and I've seen the projects and the stature of the projects in other cities like Seattle and other cities in downtown L.A. and it's just fantastic that they're willing to invest their time and money here. And as far as that's concerned, I think the only question I had was just clarification. I know I spoke with John earlier today on the six or $7 million that we are going to that we're projected to see within the total that, you know, from the former restructuring plan to now, will that be realized within the nine years or within the 20 year term? The nine years, correct?\nSpeaker 9: Yeah. Councilmember So that the 7 million projection that is cited in the the staff report is just the city's portion of the first nine years.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah.\nSpeaker 9: The actual number of four for Tom projected on this much larger project will be 77 million over the 20 years. City will realize an estimated $50 million in total over that term.\nSpeaker 2: Great. I appreciate that. So I'll just end with saying that we're going from a $165 million investment to a $230 million investment. That's not just dollars. That's workers. It's employment for the city of Long Beach. And I think all of you, again, for being great players in all of this. Thank. You.\nSpeaker 5: Thank you. So I would like some clarification on the amendments and what requirement that puts on the developer, because I have to admit, I'm a little bit confused at this point in terms of what the amendment does to the developer. I may have missed that along the way, but I know we can't force them to do certain things, but then we're including them as amendments as part of this contract.\nSpeaker 9: So I'm sorry, Councilman Price, what what amendments are you referring to? The amendments that are included in the staff report.\nSpeaker 1: Or the amendments that were made on the.\nSpeaker 5: Floor? The amendments that were made on the floor.\nSpeaker 1: So I'll walk through the four amendments again to the extent I remember them off the top of my head. The first one is that right now 3.2 H requires the buyer to execute a labor peace agreement prior to the city's obligation to transfer the property. 3.2 I requires the buyer to I'm sorry, the hotel operator. So it's the buyer's contracted operator to execute a card check neutrality agreement with its employees or agree to do that when it has employees prior to the city's transfer of the property. Both of those conditions right now, as the agreement reads, are craveable by city staff, which is normal in purchase and sale agreements. All conditions that run to the benefit of either the buyer or the seller are waiver bbl by the buyer or seller respectively. I want the first amendment was not to make those craveable. So those two are hard and fast requirements to the extent that the staff wants to close without either one of those two agreements, that council would have to approve that. Is that clear?\nSpeaker 3: I think so, yes.\nSpeaker 1: That's the First Amendment. The Second Amendment was the inclusion of a panic button, as it were. And I'm sure that I will be able to work up more detail for the agreement in a commercially reasonable, commercially standard panic buttons for all the employees of the hotel. The third one was requiring the developer to use a best effort to work with the city economic development. To the extent that there is a third party operator or there will be a restaurant at the property. Keep in mind that this property may not be developed with a restaurant. It may not even be developed as a hotel. There's still the entitlement and squat process to go through, which is completely separate from what we're doing here. And the last request was. That's right. That's right. That last request was the system in place for the hotel operator to work with its employees to take sexual harassment claims and make sure that that's not done on the employees time? As I understand it, that would be on the clock. So that's all the detail that I expect to excuse me, including the amendment. Above and beyond what was already disclosed in the council letter, which Mr. Keisler spoke to.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. So a couple of questions on the panic buttons. How many rooms does this hotel have?\nSpeaker 9: Councilmember. It's proposed for 416 rooms.\nSpeaker 5: Okay, that's good. Because as I indicated very strongly the last time this item came before council.\nSpeaker 3: I believe all.\nSpeaker 5: Employees should be protected from sexual assault and harassment regardless of the size of a hotel. So it's good to know that this hotel is over the threshold of 100 rooms, which was arbitrarily set in a prior proposal. But but surely that policy should apply to hotels of even ten rooms. So that's that's good to know. In terms of the first and second provisions, how is that? I mean, we heard the operator, the owner of the project, talk about their commitment to those the play and working with their employees on the union aspects. How are these two amendments changing? What the understanding of the city or the hotel owner? What as to these two elements, how how did these two amendments change that understanding?\nSpeaker 9: My understanding is that these amendments.\nSpeaker 1: Don't change the substance of either agreement.\nSpeaker 2: Okay.\nSpeaker 5: So the substance stays the same? Yep. Okay. And our contract, our contractual obligation, would not change as a result of these two amendments.\nSpeaker 1: That's correct. I mean, the contractual obligation would change in that the city staff can no longer waive them. They no longer have a contractual right to waive. They have to come back to the council.\nSpeaker 5: Perfect. I understand that. I'd like to hear from my colleagues on this, but I think some of the amendments are definitely make a lot of sense, like the panic button. And I support that entirely. Thanks.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, counsel. I'm in Austin.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you very much. So this is a been a very, very interesting discussion thus far. I was really struck by listening to public comment, particularly those from labor. I'm thrilled that this hotel is in the works. I think it's going to be a great luxury hotel potentially for our our downtown skyline, but also for to improve economic development. And it's been mentioned it's going to create jobs, construction jobs and hotel jobs as well. I was struck by the comments. Labor clearly is not on the same page and not monolithic on this particular item. And so from time to time, there are disagreements within even the House of Labor. And I think that speaks to some of the leadership today. I think these are this these kind of public disagreements should be avoided in the future. But I'm curious regarding the amendments, and I appreciate the effort put forth. We want to make sure that we we have a sound public project. Labor agreement is something that the city has worked towards for some time. We've actually, I think, work toward getting card check neutrality agreements as well. I don't think this would have been accomplished or even be entertained five years ago or with council's previous to this council. And so I think we've come a long way as a city. But regarding the the amendments I gave, number one and number two, I'm fine with. But in terms of what we are doing this evening, it's it's creating a in agreement with the developer correct over TLT and some of these issues will be borne out after the hotel is actually developed in. We're talking about operations of a hotel. And so my question is what and I was going to ask this question is what enforcement mechanisms will the city have, you know, after this hotel is built, should any one of these provisions not be adhered to? For example, number four or number two, what what what provisions what kind of enforcement can can can happen at that point? At this point, we're talking about a well, an operator that we don't know who is going to be. Right. Right. We would hope that they have a contract neutrality and a collective bargaining agreement in place which could be negotiated at that point. But but what kind of this is this is what kind of enforcement is.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Isom? That's a good question. The enforcement before the sale would be that they don't get the developer doesn't get the property, which which is a pretty big hammer to wield. However, at their after after escrow closes, the city would have very limited enforcement powers over that. But the idea would be that the developer won't get the property until such time as an agreement is signed with the union providing for the panic button. So it would be incumbent upon the organized labor to then enforce its rights under the written agreement, which I would expect it would be able to do on an ongoing basis\nSpeaker 7: . And so, with what I understand, organized labor coming back or enforcing their rights with their collective bargaining rights, but would they come back to the city or would we be the arbiter at that point, or would that be?\nSpeaker 1: No, I think the courts would be the arbiter at that time. Okay.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you for that. I will. I'm looking forward to hearing more and more comment and conversation about this. Again, I'm in the spirit. I am certainly supportive of of building and developing a hotel in our downtown. I think it's necessary, particularly on that that corner something this is something that we should be be working towards. I want to congratulate and thank our staff for negotiating what I believe is a creative agreement that gets to yes with American life. And I want to thank American life, the president, for being here personally and for for his commitment. I've done some research on the developer. They've had some very great projects throughout the country, throughout the downtown L.A. area. And I hope we're able to to reach an agreement. Here this evening to help to move forward with something that I think is will be an economic development boon for the city of Long Beach.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman. Councilman. Mongo.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I am so excited about this project. I think that I hear from my colleagues that their support to build another hotel in downtown Long Beach. I think that it's great jobs, great local hire program. Locally owned and operated restaurant opportunity. I think that a lot of credit goes to the staff for all your work on this. The developer for coming to the table, labor for coming to the table. I think that it's a tipping point for Long Beach and I think the projects like this will continue to come forward at a benefit to the city and a benefit to the residents. It is no wonder that we are seeing record levels of lower the lowest levels of unemployment in our city's recorded history. Local hire programs create that, and that is really important. We're also seeing impressive household income growth, unlike is being seen in the rest of the country. We are top we are number seven in the country for income growth. And projects like this continue to contribute to that. And so thank you to everyone who cares about our neighborhoods. And thank you for working through this together. I look forward to a ribbon cutting.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Councilman Ringo. Thank you, Mayor. What a difference a couple of weeks makes. While I'm very, very amazed at this city council, I'm very proud of the city council today because of the support that they are giving. Not only a new development, not new perhaps, but new to the city of Long Beach and their willingness to adapt and change and include some of those key points that we want to have to protect not only workers, but to give jobs to people. And I think that that's amazing. I want to thank, of course, Councilmember Pearce for taking that bold step and included some of these items in there and in her amendment to the project, because I was already looking at the possibility of us not strong enough, we need to include support announced by. The bottom line is that as long as we have a labor agreement, then a project that's going to be working for Long Beach, it's going to be unprecedented, from what I understand, for us and for the region. I think it speaks volumes about the city council, how progressive it is, how mindful it is of all of its responsibilities to not only its residents, but to the working class and to the working people of Long Beach. So thank you very much. I will be supporting the item. Thank you. I know that all the other council members have spoken. I want to just say just one thing and then we'll go it will go to the vote. I want to just you know, this is have been a parcel of land that's been empty for decades. And I want to thank, obviously, the team that's come forward to develop. What is going to be Long Beach is first a four star hotel. It's going to be incredible activator and job creator. I want to thank, of course, our partners in labor the fact this will be the largest private labor agreement, I believe, in the entire city. You guys are going to build a pretty substantial project and I just want to congratulate all the good jobs are going to be created. I think it's great and complete as we did the first time support. There'll be a contract agreement. And of course, this is also going to provide millions of dollars of economic development into into the city as well as into the jobs from boat for both the hotel workers on site, the food service workers. And of course, the workers are going to be building this incredible structure on the corner of ocean and pine. So these we're the largest hotels in the city. This will be also, I believe I was talking to our economic development folks, Mr. Chrysler, but it will be it's one of the largest hotel construction projects, I believe, happening in the state of California. If that's not if that's not correct. Is that right?\nSpeaker 9: Honorable Maria. It's one of the most certainly per room. It's the one of the most expensive.\nSpeaker 1: Okay, good. Well, good. Okay. Excellent. Well, thank you. Look forward to seeing this thing come out of the ground next year. I want to thank the councilmember. I want to thank the the the staff who worked incredibly hard and also want to thank the folks that don't get a lot of thanks often. But you guys worked so hard on this to our city attorney team. Thank you for the years of this work. So, member, please cast your vote. Motion case. Thank you very much. Great. Okay. We are now. That's believe it or not, we're about to start the regular agenda, which is crazy. So the hearings are over. We're going to we're only going to one request to move an item up. So we are going to hear the first. Two things we'll do is hear the item and then consent calendar. I'm sorry, then public comment, then we will do a consent calendar. So we are going to do Councilman Austin's item.\nSpeaker 0: No, no, no.\nSpeaker 1: I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. That was the item. I meant the item for Dr. Williams where I'm looking at the wrong one that got moved up. Item 26, 26.","label":1}

{"text":"You might have heard that light is a kind of wave and that the color of an object is related to the frequency of light waves it reflects. High-frequency light waves look violet, low-frequency light waves look red, and in-between frequencies look yellow, green, orange, and so on. You might call this idea physical color because it says that color is a physical property of light itself. It's not dependent on human perception. And, while this isn't wrong, it isn't quite the whole story either. For instance, you might have seen this picture before. As you can see, the region where the red and green lights overlap is yellow. When you think about it, this is pretty weird. Because light is a wave, two different frequencies shouldn't interact with each other at all, they should just co-exist like singers singing in harmony. So, in this yellow looking region, two different kinds of light waves are present: one with a red frequency, and one with a green frequency. There is no yellow light present at all. So, how come this region, where the red and green lights mix, looks yellow to us? To understand this, you have to understand a little bit about biology, in particular, about how humans see color. Light perception happens in a paper-thin layer of cells, called the retina, that covers the back of your eyeball. In the retina, there are two different types of light-detecting cells: rods and cones. The rods are used for seeing in low-light conditions, and there is only one kind of those. The cones, however, are a different story. There three kinds of cone cells that roughly correspond to the colors red, green, and blue. When you see a color, each cone sends its own distinct signal to your brain. For example, suppose that yellow light, that is real yellow light, with a yellow frequency, is shining on your eye. You don't have a cone specifically for detecting yellow, but yellow is kind of close to green and also kind of close to red, so both the red and green cones get activated, and each sends a signal to your brain saying so. Of course, there is another way to activate the red cones and the green cones simultaneously: if both red light and green light are present at the same time. The point is, your brain receives the same signal, regardless of whether you see light that has the yellow frequency or light that is a mixture of the green and red frequencies. That's why, for light, red plus green equals yellow. And, how come you can't detect colors when it's dark? Well, the rod cells in your retina take over in low-light conditions. You only have one kind of rod cell, and so there is one type of signal that can get sent to your brain: light or no light. Having only one kind of light detector doesn't leave any room for seeing color. There are infinitely many different physical colors, but, because we only have three kinds of cones, the brain can be tricked into thinking it's seeing any color by carefully adding together the right combination of just three colors: red, green, and blue. This property of human vision is really useful in the real world. For example, TV manufacturing. Instead of having to put infinitely many colors in your TV set to simulate the real world, TV manufacturers only have to put three: red, green, and blue, which is lucky for them, really.","label":1}

{"text":"It's a common saying that elephants never forget, but these magnificent animals are more than giant walking hard drives. The more we learn about elephants, the more it appears that their impressive memory is only one aspect of an incredible intelligence that makes them some of the most social, creative, and benevolent creatures on Earth. Unlike many proverbs, the one about elephant memory is scientifically accurate. Elephants know every member in their herd, able to recognize as many as 30 companions by sight or smell. This is a great help when migrating or encountering other potentially hostile elephants. They also remember and distinguish particular cues that signal danger and can recall important locations long after their last visit. But it's the memories unrelated to survival that are the most fascinating. Elephants remember not only their herd companions but other creatures who have made a strong impression on them. In one case, two circus elephants that had briefly performed together rejoiced when crossing paths 23 years later. This recognition isn't limited to others of their species. Elephants have also recognized humans they've bonded with after decades apart. All of this shows that elephant memory goes beyond responses to stimuli. Looking inside their heads, we can see why. The elephant boasts the largest brain of any land mammal, as well as an impressive encephalization quotient. This is the size of the brain relative to what we'd expect for an animal's body size, and the elephant's EQ is nearly as high as a chimpanzee's. And despite the distant relation, convergent evolution has made it remarkably similar to the human brain, with as many neurons and synapses and a highly developed hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It is the hippocampus, strongly associated with emotion, that aids recollection by encoding important experiences into long-term memories. The ability to distinguish this importance makes elephant memory a complex and adaptable faculty beyond rote memorization. It's what allows elephants who survived a drought in their youth to recognize its warning signs in adulthood, which is why clans with older matriarchs have higher survival rates. Unfortunately, it's also what makes elephants one of the few non-human animals to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The cerebral cortex, on the other hand, enables problem solving, which elephants display in many creative ways. They also tackle problems cooperatively, sometimes even outwitting the researchers and manipulating their partners. And they've grasped basic arithmetic, keeping track of the relative amounts of fruit in two baskets after multiple changes. The rare combination of memory and problem solving can explain some of elephants' most clever behaviors, but it doesn't explain some of the things we're just beginning to learn about their mental lives. Elephants communicate using everything from body signals and vocalizations, to infrasound rumbles that can be heard kilometers away. And their understanding of syntax suggests that they have their own language and grammar. This sense of language may even go beyond simple communication. Elephants create art by carefully choosing and combining different colors and elements. They can also recognize twelve distinct tones of music and recreate melodies. And yes, there is an elephant band. But perhaps the most amazing thing about elephants is a capacity even more important than cleverness: their sense of empathy, altruism, and justice. Elephants are the only non-human animals to mourn their dead, performing burial rituals and returning to visit graves. They have shown concern for other species, as well. One working elephant refused to set a log down into a hole where a dog was sleeping, while elephants encountering injured humans have sometimes stood guard and gently comforted them with their trunk. On the other hand, elephant attacks on human villages have usually occurred right after massive poachings or cullings, suggesting deliberate revenge. When we consider all this evidence, along with the fact that elephants are one of the few species who can recognize themselves in a mirror, it's hard to escape the conclusion that they are conscious, intelligent, and emotional beings. Unfortunately, humanity's treatment of elephants does not reflect this, as they continue to suffer from habitat destruction in Asia, ivory poaching in Africa, and mistreatment in captivity worldwide. Given what we now know about elephants and what they continue to teach us about animal intelligence, it is more important than ever to ensure that what the English poet John Donne described as \"nature's great masterpiece\" does not vanish from the world's canvas.","label":1}

{"text":"As an international student in college, I had tried everything to catch the eye of a recruiter. I did not want a full-time job, just an opportunity for an internship to utilize the knowledge I learned prior to coming back home.\n\nI joined school clubs. I volunteered at conferences. I showed up in every free training and job fair there were. Nothing was going anywhere until I met my professor, let\u2019s call him Dr. W.\n\nDr. W was the director of the Supply Chain program at the school I attended. He built this program to be so ruthless that most people drop out after the first course, which no other professor but him taught.\n\nAs he constantly brought previous students to visit his classes, as hiring managers from big companies, I had a lot of interest in working for these companies.\n\nI remember staying in class after employees from a big aviation corporation visited to ask him for guidance on how to get a job, I was in utter shock when he told me: \u201coh, you\u2019re an international student? What are you doing here? They\u2019re not gonna hire you. Go home!\u201d\n\nWhat he said sent me to so much shock that I still remember it, word for word.\n\nI can\u2019t lie about how I felt about it, despite how much of a strong and independent woman I wished to be. I cried for 30 minutes, slept for 10 hours afterward, then brushed my hands on my jeans, and kept going.\n\nI showed up to MORE training workshops.\n\nSince it is incredibly difficult to get sponsored, I needed to stand out among other candidates. In my field (or any field really!!), data is king. Any data skills will set us apart. And as this was such a well-rounded program, we had constant opportunities to attend SQL, Tableau, etc. training workshops, free of charge.\n\nI showed up to EVER. SINGLE. ONE of them. This is a big deal since these were always on weekends. But I knew that I had to sacrifice my time and put in more effort than others to even get noticed.\n\nWords I told myself: My starting point does not define my worth, my efforts do.\n\nI signed up for business case competitions.\n\nThe big aviation corporation mentioned above was one of the major businesses in Portland. They were a big deal.\n\nEvery year, they host a case competition for business students from five colleges in the PNW to compete against each other. The main prize was a guaranteed interview for the member of the winning teams\n\nTHIS. WAS. MY. CHANCE.\n\nI was warned about how demanding this competition would be. And it really was challenging. Outside of class, my team of five spent over 80 hours together in a week to solve the case. Dr. W, who was the advocate for this competition in our program, really emphasized that only the best of the best students can win our school level for a chance to present in front of the corporation\u2019s executives.\n\nIt took me two years of competing, with different team members, to win. But the moment we won, I knew that my hard work has been partially paid off.\n\nWas I scared and nervous when I signed up for it? Hell, yes. But did I do it anyway? I had to.\n\nWords I told myself: I will NOT miss out on a great opportunity just because I am a coward!\n\nI negotiated my opportunities.\n\nThe year my team won was the first year our school ever won regional. It was a big deal. This brought more than just recognition for our program. We received more sponsorships.\n\nKnowing what I helped bring to the table, I came to see Dr. W in his office. We had a long chat about what he could do for me after the competition.\n\nThough I knew I was not getting a shot at the aviation company, despite winning first place in their competition, due to security concerns, I was connected to hiring managers in multiple other corporations.\n\nI was able to use Dr. W\u2019s network for an internship at another company that suited me better. The internship turned into a contract, which turned into a full-time opportunity.\n\nWords I told myself: Know your worth, and negotiate! You worked hard for it.\n\nI asked about his intention.\n\nThinking back about my immediate reaction after Dr. W\u2019s comment, I was quite shocked. It is not what a professor should ever say to his students, regardless of their employability. Despite all the things I did to prove him wrong, I wanted to give the man the benefit of the doubt, that his intention was not bad and the problem was in his delivery.\n\nAfter working with him to gain me an internship, I took the opportunity to ask about his intention when he made the initial comment to me. Though there is no excuse to say the things he did, the man did not mean to say that I should have gone home.\n\nIt was a hectic night. Everyone wanted an opportunity with these hiring managers. Since this is an aviation company that holds national secret technology, I really did not stand a chance as a non-US citizen. And that\u2019s for good reason. He told me to go home, where I resided at the time, so give other students more time with them. And he had a plan to connect me with those from companies that would hire non-citizen.","label":0}

{"text":"The purpose of people and work.\n\nPhoto by Helloquence on Unsplash\n\nAlmost 90 years ago, in the throes of the Great Depression, while most of the world bemoaned the dismal global economy, British economist John Maynard Keynes, in an essay titled, Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren, argued that the real problem facing mankind wasn\u2019t a depressed economy.\n\n\u201c[F]or the first time since his creation man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem \u2014 how to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the leisure, which science and compound interest will have won for him, to live wisely and agreeably and well.\u201d\n\nAccording to Keynes the world was \u201cbeing afflicted with a new disease\u201d called \u201ctechnological unemployment.\u201d Because of this new disease, \u201cmankind will be deprived of its traditional purpose,\u201d wrote Keynes.\n\nFor many today, these words seem prophetic as AI and automation seem poised to advance to the point in the next several years or decades to turn these predictions into reality. A much quoted 2013 University of Oxford study, which predicted that 47% of US jobs were susceptible to automation in the next two decades, only seems to confirm these claims.\n\nAnd the issue isn\u2019t confined to America. In 2016, World Bank president at the time, Jim Yong Kim listed the jobs threatened by automation in India at 69%, China at 77%, and Ethiopia at a staggering 85%.\n\nMore recently, an article on Forbes.com addressed these challenges, emphasizing the economic impact these changes could have on the global economy,\n\n\u201cIt seems that the potential impact of emerging explosive manufacturing\/production forces will massively reduce or eliminate the hours of the working week and number of working hours \u2014 fundamentally choking the nature of the economic system globally.\u201d\n\nBut among all these recent forecasts and concerns about what AI and automation mean for the world\u2019s economies, it is Keynes who seems to understand the nature of the problem the best. Fundamentally this isn\u2019t an issue about economies and money, this is about \u201cmankind [being] deprived of its traditional purpose.\u201d\n\nWhy We Work\n\nIn Genesis 1 we see God at work in creating the earth and all that is in it. As the pinnacle of that creation, God created man in his own image. Genesis 1:26 says,\n\n\u201cThen God said, \u201cLet us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.\u201d\n\nThat we are created in God\u2019s image forms the foundation of the traditional Christian understanding of man\u2019s purpose on earth. In a sense Keynes is right, our purpose is to work as we can clearly see from this passage in Genesis and in verse 28 where God places man in the garden to work it. Timothy Keller in his book, Every Good Endeavor echoes this point, writing,\n\n\u201cThe material creation was made by God to be developed, cultivated, and cared for in an endless number of ways through human labor.\u201d\n\nSo in a sense not only were we created to work, but the earth was created to be worked by us.\n\nBut man\u2019s purpose is more than just work. In Matthew 22 an expert in the law asked Jesus what the greatest commandment in the law was. Of course we know that the purpose of the question wasn\u2019t genuine but rather to find a way to trap Jesus in his words. Despite this, Jesus gives a compelling answer, and one that is relevant to the discussion of Christians and work. Jesus replied:\n\n\u201c\u2018Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.\u2019 This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: \u2018Love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.\u201d\n\nJesus doesn\u2019t answer by saying that the greatest commandment is \u201cthou shalt work,\u201d so how does his answer relate to man\u2019s created purpose of work? It does so in two ways.\n\nFirst we see that the number one commandment Jesus has in mind when answering the question is \u201cLove God.\u201d To understand the connection between work and loving God consider the words of Colossians 3:23,\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men.\u201d\n\nOur work, fulfilling our purpose as image-bearers of our creator, and working heartily unto Him, for his glory, is perhaps the greatest way we can love him. John Piper puts it this way in his book Don\u2019t Waste Your Life,\n\n\u201c\u2026the capstone of that divine work was man, a creature in God\u2019s own image designed to carry on the work of ruling and shaping and designing creation. Therefore, at the heart of the meaning of work is creativity. If you are God, your work is to create out of nothing. If you are not God, but like God \u2014 that is, if you are human \u2014 your work is to take what God has made and shape it and use it to make him look great.\u201d\n\nThe second thing we see in Jesus\u2019 answer is that we are to love our neighbors as ourselves. While we know that this can and must be done in myriad ways, one way we can do this is through our work. Hugh Whelchel, in his book, How Then Should We Work?, writes,\n\n\u201cwe respond to the call to love our neighbor by fulfilling the duties associated with our everyday work.\u201d\n\nThese two purposes of work are very different from what our culture usually thinks of when they think about work. Often times work is conceptualized as a way to make money or to realize personal fulfillment. Those two ideas and others like them are nowhere found in the Christian idea and purpose of work. Instead we see that it is man\u2019s purpose to work and in that work to glorify and love God, and to love and serve his neighbor.\n\nNow we can see why Keynes is right to understand that automation, AI, and \u201cthe disease of technological unemployment,\u201d are huge issues. They threaten not only man\u2019s purpose of work, but since his call to love God and love neighbor are intertwined with that purpose, they threaten every aspect of his existence.\n\nIn his essay in 1930, Keynes realizing the weight of his thesis, added these words,\n\n\u201cYet there is no country and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and of abundance without a dread.\u201d\n\nIn spite of this dread, Keynes offered a glimmer of hope, or perhaps a blueprint for how to survive this \u201cage of leisure,\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it will be those peoples, who can keep alive, and cultivate into a fuller perfection, the art of life itself and do not sell themselves for the means of life, who will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.\u201d\n\nAnd I too believe there is hope. Though perhaps one day the nine-to-five might turn into the ten-to-two (three days a week), that does not mean that man will need to abandon his pursuit of loving God and loving neighbor through work, in fact he might even have a better chance of fulfilling that purpose. Reconsider Timothy Keller\u2019s words from above,\n\n\u201cThe material creation was made by God to be developed, cultivated, and cared for in an endless number of ways through human labor.\u201d\n\nNote the words \u201cendless number of ways.\u201d It might be the case that without the constraints of the typical nine-to-five we will be able to use our God-given creativity and time to garden, or paint, or sew, or cook, or write, or build, or whatever to the glory of God and to the benefit of neighbor.\n\nAnd we may or may not even have the vision to see what work will look like on the other side of automation, but in the words of Jason Meyer,\n\n\u201cGod calls us to use the intelligence and skill that he gave us to bring order out of the chaos in order to create a context for flourishing\u2026When you are doing the dishes, you are doing a divine work. You are giving structure so that you and those around you can flourish. That work can honor God.\u201d\n\nIf doing the dishes can be a work that honors God and helps my neighbor, then there are \u201cendless\u201d possibilities for me to do so.\n\nIf the \u201cage of leisure\u201d does ever get here, I suspect that those who have a proper understanding of the purpose of man to work, and the purpose of that work to love God and love people, will be the ones \u201cwho will be able to enjoy the abundance when it comes.\u201d Their work won\u2019t be their identity because it was never meant to be anyway, and they will use their time, their work to fulfill the purpose for which it and they were created. In the meantime and in that time my prayer is Psalm 90:17,\n\n\u201cLet the favor of the Lord our God be upon us and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!\u201d SDG\n\nJohn Thomas is a freelance writer.

One actually it says one, but there's only one. So here we go. On page one, line 30, Strike Clerk File number 20220052. As filed with the Denver City Clerk on April 27, 2022 and replace with clerk file number 20220052a.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. It's been moved. Can we get a second, please? Thank you. Comments by members of Council on the Council Amendment. Council Member Sawyer.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. Hang on. Let me look here. There's a little more for me to read. Do I need to? Yes. Specify elements will make my house.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm going to do.\nSpeaker 3: Perfect.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. So thank you, Madam President, for clarifying that this amendment is just a small tweak to the amendment that Councilwoman Sandoval had brought regarding parking that was adopted in LUTI. And the purpose of it is just to align the requirements for any developer within a quarter mile of a proposed transit corridor or rail line with the current citywide parking requirements for affordable housing developers. So that's point one parking spots per unit. I agree 100% with Councilwoman Sandoval's amendment. I'm just concerned that there's going to be real world implications resulting from that change. Not only is it going to cause some safety issues in the neighborhood that board it border these transit zones. But actually I believe it will end up exacerbating gentrification and displacement in some of our most vulnerable neighborhoods. The way it reads now, it would require zero parking spots for any developer that's building the affordable units into their development along that planned transit corridor. So functionally, this does two things. First, people are still going to have cars and no parking means those cars are going to end up on the street. We see major problems with sightlines on the streets. That line major transit corridors. For example, we have a section of 14th Avenue between Grape and Hudson. In the three years I've been in office, we have had over 14 crashes. And I'm not talking about like fender benders, like rollover crashes that have taken out people's fences, people's front yards, people's almost people's houses. And we're still waiting for the city to do something about it. I don't want to make this problem any worse. Second, allowing a parking exemption in this area makes the land within that buffer zone more attractive to market rate developers. That drives up the cost of the land along our planned transit corridors. That means it's going to be impossible for affordable housing developers to purchase that land. So instead of getting 30 affordable units in a development being built by an affordable housing developer, we're going to get four affordable units and 26 market rate units built by a market rate developer. It will take ten of those developments to get the same number of affordable units along a transit line. We're already seeing this trend in East Colfax, even with the parking exemption in place. So, for example, we've got three motels in East Colfax that were all recently purchased by market rate developers, even though there were affordable housing developers bidding on those properties as well. We've see that the affordable developers simply cannot compete with the offers coming from market rate developers exempting all parking requirements for a developer who only plans to build to finish percent, maybe a little more of the total units as affordable is only going to make this problem worse and thus exacerbate the gentrification and displacement that we already see happening in East Colfax, which is one of our most vulnerable neighborhoods. That said, as I mentioned before, I agree 100% with the intent behind Councilwoman Sandoval's amendment. So I'm just proposing this point one parking amendment to align I think it strikes with the affordable housing developer requirement, which is city wide, not just along transit corridors. I think that this is sort of striking a balance. So it's offering an incentive to market rate developers to build those affordable units into their developments along the transit buffer zones. But it doesn't necessarily make those challenges to gentrification and displacement or those safety issues that we're seeing along these corridors any worse. So by aligning those parking incentives in the buffer zone, market rate developers with the already existing parking incentive for affordable housing developers, which, like I said, exists across the city, I think that's just a little bit of a better balance. So that's why I'm making this recommendation, and I hope you will support it tonight. Thanks, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Steuer. Next up, we've got Councilmember CdeBaca.\nSpeaker 3: Mine is just for comments, not a vote on an amendment tonight, but just wanting to give my colleagues a heads up that I will be proposing an amendment to the three on the 30th. And Blake, this one and the. The other piece of this, the map, one just to one increase our fees and then to to make the 38th and Blake amendment not up zone. I think it's area seven all the way to 12 stories that's out of compliance with the plan the neighborhood plan that we have. And so I'd ask my colleagues to honor that and take a look at them. And it'll be in your inbox tonight when you all get home. And then the map amendment to match it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. We're going to go ahead then and return to the amendment on the floor. Councilmember Sandoval, go ahead.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. If it's okay, can I please call and please hook up to help us answer some questions?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Just introduce yourself and Elise for the record.\nSpeaker 3: Good evening. Members of Council Annaliese Hoke, principal city planner with Community Planning and Development. Thank you for being here tonight, Annalise. So with this amendment, even though the language seems to be simple. I have found when I been working within the zoning code. It's not as simple as it always seems like. It's called out in in different areas. So can you just talk about are there any unintended consequences of this particular amendment? It's hard to know the magnitude of unintended consequences, as we haven't had a ton of time to really evaluate it. But one just piece, it's more of a technical drafting thing that sometimes we don't get into the weeds. Our Denver zoning code has our parking minimums, but then within that it also has parking exemptions, parking reductions and alternative parking ratios. The parking exemption language that is being proposed through this change is remaining in that parking exemption section of the code, but it's actually an alternative parking ratio of 0.1. So there's a little bit of a technical confusion where we're essentially adding another layer of an alternative parking ratio, but in kind of a different section of the code . So there's sort of that technical piece. I think it's also important to note that this is not only peeling back the amendment that was passed out of ludy as it pertained to expanding this to BRT corridors once they were constructed. But it's also peeling back the parking exemption in areas that are within a quarter mile of a fixed rail transit station, which we have really not received any opposition or concerns about. If anything, we've seen a higher rate of comments supporting those to be expanded further. So I don't know if that's helpful. Thank you. So one quick one. Also question can cause this policy so dense? There's a lot in it. The. The proposal for the parking exemption. Can you talk about how it's an incentive to for the policy and how you would actually if a developer chose to go with the incentive, they would. What's their deliverable? Are they're in for the amount of affordable units we would get? Great question. Yes. So this policy sort of has two tiers of build on site requirements as well as alternative compliance. And the incentives are really designed to ensure that we are getting as many units built on site creating mixed income, affordable housing . That first tier is base incentives, and that includes the alternative parking ratio, which gets a reduction down of all units by point one. And that's context sensitive. So that is for building units on site. Depending upon that compliance option, it ranges from 8 to 10% on their market area. However, in exchange for a greater level of affordability on site to more affordable units, developer applicants have the ability to then pursue additional incentives. Parking exemptions is one of those. It's important to note that these parking reductions and exemptions were really also derived out of conversations with the affordable housing development community, as they are commonly the ones who are looking at those really small, really challenging, hard to develop parcels that are often passed up by market rate developers because they are still continuing to provide parking that is well above the minimums that we see. And so this is really serving as another meaningful incentive to allow for projects to move forward in those transit rich areas and provide more units over affordable or excuse me, more units of both market rate and affordable over parking spaces. Thank you. And one last question, one last comments. Last question. In the public comments that you have received after the amendment from Moody, did you receive public comment for this bill supporting the amendment that we brought forward to reduce the parking around the quarter mile? And I want to make sure that I'm clear I'm built or something that is going to be built into it can't just be aspirational. And the city actually has to be something that we are going to build out. Can you talk to us about some of the public comment you received? Yeah, certainly. So throughout this process and up until the formal public hearing, we are going to continue to gather public comment that we receive. But there is a notable spike in public comments following the amendment. The majority of those comments coming in were speaking to support of those changes. There was certainly, you know, folks that do raise concerns, but it was certainly at a much smaller ratio than those in support and those will be included. Anything that came in after will be included in the council packets along with any other public comment. Great. Thank you. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. And thank you, Annaliese. Next up, we've got Councilmember Hines.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, council president.\nSpeaker 1: I share Councilmember Sawyer's concern. We have a lot of cars in our city, and we continue to have more cars in our city and we continue to have crashes.\nSpeaker 7: And lots of traffic and gridlock.\nSpeaker 1: Colorado, which my colleague from District five and I share, might as well charge for parking. It is just such a mess. That said, I think that we should get rid of we should get government out of the business of parking minimums at all. Frankly, if the funding stack would allow it, I would prefer parking maximums in our city. I think that that what we need to do is make sure that we have good alternatives to cars, including a broad.\nSpeaker 2: Inviting, pedestrian experience.\nSpeaker 1: Protected bike lanes and and other ways for people to get around our city without a car. We're expecting an additional 200,000 people to move to the city of Denver by 2040. That's in the Blueprint 2019 adopted plan. And if we don't provide viable alternatives to cars and encourage that, those 200,000 people will bring at least an additional 200,000 cars. So if you think parking is bad now when we have 30% more people in cars here, it'll just be way worse. So I recognize that we have a lot of challenges and issues with traffic in cars. I want to make sure that we encourage people to live along areas where we can have car alternatives, such as major transit corridors. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Hines, Councilmember Flynn.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Madam President. On a list, could you expand a little bit on the advisory committee? And it's how you address some of the comments and concerns that you heard with them, because my understanding is that when this went. From the advisory committee. Whenever I'm from CPD two Planning Board, it included part of an exemption only for affordable, deeply affordable at a near fixed transit stations like rail zacharek. Okay. And the recommendation from planning board was to bring it to committee where it was amended by Councilwoman Sandoval to extend or to restore that exemption. That was in the original proposal that had been modified at the advisory committee.\nSpeaker 3: Is that. Yeah. I'll clarify a little bit more. So the advisory committee is comprised of about 20 or so individuals with various backgrounds throughout the city of Denver. Councilman Sandoval and can each have also been serving on that committee and thank you for your continued time commitment on that. In the kind of last round of public comments before publishing that that planning board review draft, we did hear some concerns, particularly out of some of the committee conversations around the expansiveness of the parking exemption. And so we peeled that back to only apply to the fixed rail transit stations. At the advisory committee, we did have some members that, you know, expressed some concern and disappointment with that change. However, overall, we just felt like it was still appropriate and still a strong proposal to move forward with a parking exemption but allowed in fewer areas of the city. Councilwoman Sandoval then brought forth an amendment that did not restore it to its entirety of the original proposal, but rather take a more nuanced approach that was focused on corridors within that that capital investment that the city was making as realized. And we had that adequate infrastructure in place.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Can you explain what that adequate infrastructure is? I'm thinking of Federal Boulevard, which is a really good service. Yeah, but it is proposed in the future for BRT. I'm sorry, bus rapid transit speak, an acronym. So would this not apply until and unless the BRT is built out on Federal Boulevard and it would not apply now when it's simply the Route 31 and 30?\nSpeaker 3: That is correct. So I think the nuance of it is it's not just saying transit corridors as they exist today and have high frequency transit service, but corridors as they exist as Denver moves envisions them with not only high frequency transit service, but also the infrastructure in place to support that high, high frequency frequency capacity where you have, you know, unloading offloading off of station. So all of that is detailed in the definition in the Denver zoning code. I thought I had it printed here, but I don't.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you for that clarification. I really appreciate it. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Flynn. Councilmember Sawyer, we have you back in the queue, but I wanted to see if I could go to each and Ortega first. Sure. Okay. Thank you. Councilmember. Can each.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. Council President I just wanted to clarify two questions so everyone understands what they're voting on. You and Councilwoman Sandoval had a long conversation, but I just want to underscore. So if this amendment were to pass, we wouldn't just lose the parking exemption that Councilwoman Sandoval introduced for bus. Is that correct? What would we also lose?\nSpeaker 3: Yes, we would also lose the parking exemption of sites that are providing enhanced affordability within a quarter mile of a fixed rail transit station. So it entirely eliminates options for projects to to provide zero parking and provide that higher level of affordability.\nSpeaker 4: And we did not get feedback about that exemption around rail. So we would be losing an exemption. We got no negative feedback about, generally speaking.\nSpeaker 0: None, none.\nSpeaker 3: That I have directly received through our various feedback forms.\nSpeaker 4: The second question I want to ask is the exemption is not only available to market rate developers. So there was some rationale that, you know, this is going to change. But can you please describe how the incentives in this bill are also available to affordable developers and how this amendment would affect them?\nSpeaker 3: Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, while this is designed with market rate developers in mind, it has also been designed with how do we remove existing known barriers to affordable housing development of those low tech projects that are providing the deeply affordable, much necessary affordable housing that we need in the city. And so by even though they do have that existing point one alternative parking ratio for units at or below 60%, AMI this did allow for those projects to build on those really small, unique, challenging sites at a to zero parking ratio. So by peeling this back, it not only would have impacts on the market rate projects which have candidly kind of said Denver's not quite there yet. We need we need this infrastructure to come along. But the affordable housing projects, some of these really small sites, they can't fit the parking and the needed turn radius to develop the housing on it. And so it allows for them to actually go in and access some parcels that might otherwise be passed up by market rate developers, because there's still that expectation of needing to provide vehicle parking in the market rate development. So does that clarify?\nSpeaker 4: Thank you. So I'm just going to add my comments. I appreciate that. There are places where we as colleagues may just differ. So I respect the concerns that my colleague has. I will not be supporting this amendment tonight for the following reasons. One, because it does take us backwards on rail, and also because I believe that our bus rapid transit investments, when they are made with capital infrastructure, are intended to deliver rapid transit and the type of infrastructure to more neighborhoods than we would get through rail alone. So I supported the original Sandoval amendment and worked with the team and supported the creation of that very narrow piece. And so I absolutely do not believe that we need to remove this exemption, not just from those bus corridors, but also from those rail corridors. So that's the first reason. Secondly, I, I do not respectfully agree with the rationale behind the amendment. Affordable developers have always, in this city, had to compete with market rate developers for land. It's very rare that a piece of donated or city land is available. So this is not a new phenomenon. And yet they have managed repeatedly to identify more parcels than we've been able to find. Every year, multiple projects go into the low income housing tax credit application round and only a few are selected and other projects, unfortunately, are unable to succeed. That's on us to continue to grow the the resources that we have. But we have seen, you know, time and time again, that doesn't mean every affordable developer is able to take down every piece of property they compete for. But it means that we don't need to change our zoning code in an attempt to try to create market outcomes that have, you know, for decades managed to occur even in a tough market. I don't at all envy those affordable developers having to go out and do that competition. But there's no reason and there's no evidence behind the fact that this parking reduction alone would somehow create a differential in their ability to compete for land. There's just not data to support that. So for those reasons and then finally for the fact that we have a very dedicated planning board and a very dedicated set of stakeholders who spent time on this. And there was strong support from the stakeholders as well as from the Planning Board, for us to treat bus rapid transit a little more equitably with rail. That's the original intent behind the amendment. So for those reasons, I will not be supporting the amendments and I would urge my colleagues to reject it as well with the comfort that the market has been building plenty of parking in plenty of places where they're already not required to build any like downtown. The market has not under built parking in this city to date. And so I think that we do not need to go through back flips in our zoning code for for that purpose. So thank you very much, Council President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember each. Councilmember Ortega. Thank you, Madam President. I wanted to ask an ELISA question about the developments that we're seeing so far at our TOD sites and what am i levels that we have seen commitments to.\nSpeaker 3: At a high level. I don't know if I have a clear answer for you is that's not something that I've specifically been tracking. I think it's important to note that today we do not have any requirements to construct affordable housing. We have a very nominal linkage, which most people choose, and then we have our affordable housing projects that the city has opportunities to put funding into. And then there's a handful of projects that pursue voluntary housing agreements as a part of rezoning. So if there's something in those three segments that's of particular interest, I'm happy to follow up on that. But generally, I don't think I have a summary point. My apologies.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. No problem. Thank you for answering the question. I wanted to speak in support of this amendment and. Let me spell out what those reasons are. First of all, I have served on the board of a nonprofit housing development group as the president for many, many years. Keep trying to give away that role to my colleagues, and none of them choose to take that. But I've had intimate involvement with many of the projects that we have worked on. They're all low income projects, and it takes multiple rounds to go through the low income tax credit application process with the Colorado Housing Finance Authority, because the dollars are very competitive, both for the 9% and the 4% dollars. What I have seen in the development that has occurred across our city where they are private development and they're being asked to include affordable housing lots of times, even when we have some of our money in there, we're typically seeing commitments at 60 or 80% . Those are typically people that own cars. Where we see folks that typically don't own cars are 0 to 30% of the area median income. And even in projects that have the 0 to 30. Typically for nonprofits, they are blending incomes of people in a building there, not a project that is all 0 to 30 of the am I. It's a mix of 0 to 30 on up to typically 60, maybe 70% on the high end. So I am concerned that we are seeing for low income people that will live in a project that is an affordable unit, they're not going to they're not going to own a car. They're not going to need a parking spot. And they will be the people challenged to go find a parking spot for their cars. Yes, we all want to see people get out of their cars. But until we have the right transit system and the connectivity that allows people to get out of their car and address their first mile, last mile, we will still have people driving their cars, which is why we've actually been bringing some people from different countries and states to have presentations with this body to help us look at expanding our thinking about how we do transportation in this city. So I think this is a reasonable request. I really believe that there is a threshold difference between the 0 to 30 projects and anything from 60% above. And I would suggest that assuming this bill moves forward tonight, with or without the amendment, that we should address that threshold difference and review this ordinance at some time in the future to see exactly what is happening with the difference between those two emission levels and what's happening with the the parking issues and challenges. I can remember going to see a project in Seattle and I think some of you were part of the trip. I think this was a partnership trip, if I'm not mistaken. And we saw some affordable micro units that didn't have any parking and the people who lived in those units had cars and they were having to park four and five blocks away carrying their groceries. None of them had children because the units were too tiny. They were basically targeted for single individuals. But I don't want to exacerbate our parking issues, and I clearly understand there is an additional cost to create a parking space for a unit in these projects. But at the same time, I don't want to create a classism problem that says if you live in a low income unit, you're going to have to park your car further away because we just don't have a parking spot for you. But if you can afford one of the, you know, higher, more expensive units, then you'll get a parking spot in in your in the building. And that's that's a huge concern for me. So I will be supporting this amendment tonight. Thank you. Thank you. Councilmember Ortega. Councilmember Sawyer.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks, Madam President. Just wanted to ask Anshul to clarify. I heard several councilmembers say that this would that this was a drafting thing that would remove the parking exemption. And it does remove the parking exemption and replace it with 0.1 or 10% parking requirements for the total unit. Can you just walk through that with me and maybe clarify and confirm that what I'm saying is correct because it sort of presented a little bit differently.\nSpeaker 2: Sure. Thanks, Councilman Sawyer. So the the amendment that you're proposing would remove the exemption that's enjoyed by the and compliant structures in those areas, by rail transit authorities and then those particular design districts. And that exemption will point 9 to 27.1 units per unit.\nSpeaker 4: So it does apply to rail? Correct. And it does apply to BRT. Got it. It's just doing nothing else but changing. 02.1. Correct. Okay, great. Thank you for clarifying question for analysts really quickly. You had mentioned that you didn't have time to really take a look and dig in at this amendment. When was the first time I contacted you about this amendment?\nSpeaker 3: You followed up after alluding and I apologize. I've been out on PTO.\nSpeaker 0: So.\nSpeaker 4: Totally fair. I just wanted to make it very clear that two and a half weeks ago, two weeks ago, I reached out about this amendment. So there was plenty of time.\nSpeaker 6: Now, we.\nSpeaker 3: Looked at how we could have drafted it, but we weren't sure if you were planning to move forward. That is on my bad for not following up and understanding that this was something that you were seriously considering moving forward. So my apologies. Okay.\nSpeaker 5: Interesting.\nSpeaker 4: Great. Thank you. I really appreciate that. And no further questions at this time.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Thank you. Councilmember Sawyer, council member state.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I support this amendment tonight for many of the reasons my colleagues have shared. I do have some questions for Annalise. Can you tell us how much it costs a developer to build a parking space? Because we don't often talk about that. Yeah, certainly. So it very much depends as to whether it's a surface structured or a sub grade surface is anywhere from 8 to 12000. Sub grade goes up to about $40,000 per parking space structured as around 20 to 30. Obviously, construction costs have gone up substantially in the past year. So it might even be slightly higher than that.\nSpeaker 5: So we're talking about a range from 6000 to.\nSpeaker 3: About 15,000 or 30,000, 40000 to 40000, $6,000. So that's $40,000 we could be capturing per space that we're waiving to figure out what we want to do with it if we have another mode or method of approaching this. Right. If we charge developers what it costs, market rate developers, what it costs to wave a parking space. I'm not sure if I entirely follow your logic. My apologies.\nSpeaker 5: So instead.\nSpeaker 3: Of a. Broad brush stroke, exempting parking for market rate and affordable housing developers in these TOD areas, BRT areas. What we could be doing is continuing our parking waiver system and actually charging for each space that's waived and capturing those.\nSpeaker 0: Dollars for.\nSpeaker 3: Our affordable housing fund. Is that possible? Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. So saying we're going to require you and please correct me if I misunderstand this. So our code will still require you to provide one or 1.25 parking spaces per unit, but will let you provide none or a lower parking ratio if you pay us $40,000 . Is that correct? In terms of the scenario that that you would want to in these particular areas that we're asking them to provide in any way for free? Yeah. So I think it's important to note that while that is the cost to construct parking spaces are often times a revenue source. So in addition to the rents that folks are paying, then they're going to pay an additional cost to access those parking spaces. And so to say, to say a developer don't build a parking space and pay us is really does not have the market operates in terms of development. What this is really trying to do is eliminate a barrier. If we were to say you have to provide parking or pay us. I would be shocked to see a single developer pay us that fee and not provide the parking spaces because. It just doesn't quite work that way. What we see in our peer cities is really them taking a move to action, to getting zoning out of the way as a barrier to providing affordable housing and and ensuring that we're promoting our multimodal transportation system. So, you know, it's been, you know, something that I've heard before, but I, I just don't actually think that we would see anyone take advantage of that and pay into the funding. But we've never tried it, correct? No, we have never tried, nor has it any other city, because I think we understand the basic economics of market development. And the basic economics suggests that a developer can afford parking spaces, but it's more lucrative to not provide it. Correct. No. Right now, the market demands the vast majority of market rate developers are expected to banks are still expecting market rate developers to provide parking, which is why we see the vast majority of market rate developers over parking beyond what the minimum requirement is. What this is really doing is setting up a systems change to allow for areas in our city where we're making significant or have made significant investments to not provide parking in exchange for greater levels of affordability. But there's no control at in the area of transit or BRT. There's no control for making sure that we're getting affordable housing. This applies also to market rate developers, and so this applies to projects that have a covenant restriction, ensuring that they are providing a higher level of affordability. Anything in our zoning code that is one of these incentives requires an affordable housing plan at time of development plan and then a covenant that is recorded against the property in perpetuity prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy and the building permit. So this is not a just I'm a market rate developer and don't feel like providing parking. It is another lever for us to drive the outcomes that we want, which is providing more onsite affordable housing in our transit rich areas and which are making those investments. That higher level is not defined. So we it is it's the enhanced onsite. So in the DMZ, there's the base onsite affordable requirements and then there's the enhanced onsite affordable requirements. They must meet the enhanced onsite affordable requirements, which is a higher percentage of total affordable housing units to access those. They also have the opportunity for other fee and loos in which none of these parking reductions or incentives are available. So if a market rate project says, I'm only going to pay the fee and layer because I don't want to provide affordable housing, that's going to be a painful fee in lieu. And they have no access to these incentives or any of the other ones as a part of this package. But the affordable housing that they create, the value of it doesn't have to match the value that they saved from the parking that they don't have to construct. We don't have a formula. We're not checking that we don't even have a range pin down of what it costs per parking space that we're holding them accountable for. We have done analysis and that's included as a supplement to the financial feasibility to look at what is the added value of the incentives. So there is a notable value that we have calculated. I apologize. I don't know what off the top of my head because there's a lot of different pieces that we looked at. But essentially it shows that it is a significant value. But we also have to reality check it with what the market is expecting, where our lenders are at. We even see sometimes traffic being a little bit hesitant in some areas to go with lower parking ratios. So we know this is an evolution in our conversations and this is really us trying to lead the way of where we want our city to grow and evolve and to start to house people over cars. Well, in the information that you provided us, there was not a sufficient analysis of that. And given that our city has not reached a place where it is feasible to take multiple children across town to different schools in our School of Choice system and get to work in a reasonable amount of time, we are setting up a context where we are not building homes for people with children, for people with more than one job, for people who have disabilities or have medical conditions where they have to get to multiple doctor's appointments on public transit or on foot in a day. We're not building for the people that we say we're trying to house. We're not there yet. And so it seems as if we would be better off trying a more experimental approach to our parking waivers, expanding on the current parking waiver system that we have in a way that lets us control project by project in a more sophisticated way rather than a blanket approach to this. So for those reasons, I do not support the current bill as it stands, and I would support this amendment tonight. Thank you.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca Councilmember Sandoval.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Madam President. I find it interesting that we're having a conversation about not supporting building more housing. We just had a whole entire conversation from people, from public comment who were telling us to build more housing. And so to build two parking spaces is about 600 and give or take 650 700 square feet, two parking spaces for your car. You can also have a condo for 700 square feet. That can house people with two bedrooms, a bathroom and a closet, actually, a really nice condo. So I prefer to spend money and I would prefer to give incentives to developers, to not house cars and to house people. And that's what this amendment is doing. Just along certain areas where the city and county of Denver is also putting money and dollars to get better transit along our city. I agree with everybody. Our transit is underpass. It is not very accessible. It's not very easy to take. It needs major overhaul and major updating. But we have to live in the reality where we are now. And I would rather have housed two people in a 700 square foot condo than two cars with 700 square feet. So I would hope that my colleagues do not support this amendment and have the bill moving forward as soon as it is presented. Thank you, Madam President.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you, Councilmember Sandoval. Madam Secretary, roll call on the amendment, please.\nSpeaker 3: Sawyer I.\nSpeaker 5: Torres They.\nSpeaker 3: Black CdeBaca, I. Clark.\nSpeaker 1: No. Flynn No.\nSpeaker 5: Hines?\nSpeaker 2: No.\nSpeaker 5: Cashman?\nSpeaker 1: No.\nSpeaker 5: Kenny Ortega. Sandoval No. Madam President?\nSpeaker 0: No, Madam Secretary. Close the voting and announce the results.\nSpeaker 5: Nine days, 3 hours.\nSpeaker 0: Three eyes the amendment to 20 2-424 has failed Council Bill 20 2-424 is on the floor for publication. Comments by members of Council on Council Bill 20 to dash 042 for Council member say to market.\nSpeaker 6: Just reminding you I explained my call.\nSpeaker 3: Outs tonight were for comments to let council members know that there are amendments to review in your inbox tonight so that everyone is not feeling like anything was sprung on them. They are the amendments that I mentioned at committee. So just getting it on record. They are coming to you and I hope you all will support them.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember CdeBaca. Councilmember Sawyer.\nSpeaker 4: Thanks, Madam President. Just wanted to say that I will be supporting this this evening. Obviously, I'm disappointed that the small change to the Luti amendment was not passed, but this is an incredibly important piece of legislation and no legislation is perfect. So I will still be supporting it tonight because it is too important for a small issue like that. So I just wanted to clarify that I will be voting yes tonight and next week, but I'm disappointed that the the point one parking amendment did not pass.

{"text":"\ufeff102.\tMr. President, I wish to begin by expressing the gratification of the Government of the State of Bahrain at your election to preside over the twenty-eighth session of the General Assembly. We are looking forward with hope to a successful session under your wise leadership. I should also like to pay a tribute to our former President, Mr. Trepczynski, for the manner in which he directed the work of the previous session. Also, I should like to welcome the presence at this session of the delegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic and the presence of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas as full-fledged Members of this Organization.\n103.\tThe present session of the General Assembly has witnessed major developments in the relations between the big Powers. This has been the culmination of a series of events which took place during the last two years and which heralds a new era of relaxation in international tension and co-operation among the big Powers.\n104.\tThe restitution of the lawful rights of China in the United Nations [resolution 2758 (XXVI)\/ has-been one of the encouraging factors in the new international climate. Meanwhile, there are many serious pending problems which urgently need action. We should not neglect these questions simply because they are not of immediate interest to the big Powers. In the view of my country, colonialism, apartheid and poverty have a large impact on the future of international relations and will adversely influence the international climate unless we grapple with these persistent problems and find a speedy solution for them which is not based on expediency but which will be in conformity with the dictates of right and justice.\n105.\tI shall start with the Middle East question which contains elements of all the evils I have just alluded to, namely, colonialism, racism and poverty.\t\n106.\tIt is not my intention to review the Middle East question with which Members are all familiar. The question is now so well known that the peace-loving peoples all over the world take every opportunity to express their support for the Palestinian people and their just cause and insist on the withdrawal of Israel from the territories it occupied in 1967.\n107.\tIn the beginning of this month, more than 70 nations and Heads of State met in Algeria for the Fourth Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non- Aligned Countries, representing more than half of the population of the world, and adopted a momentous resolution regarding this question. This resolution, which contains practical measures for settling this question, should serve as an incentive to our Organization for taking appropriate action to uphold the rule of law and restore to the victims of Israeli aggression their lawful rights. I shall quote the main provisions of this resolution, which now forms part of the Political Declaration of the Conference:\n'In the Middle East, the situation continues to give rise to deep concern. Israel's obstinate persistence in its policy, of aggression, expansion and annexation, as well as its policy of oppression directed against the inhabitants of the territories occupied by force, is a challenge to the international community, the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a threat to international peace and security.\n'Drawing renewed attention to the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territories by force, the Conference calls for immediate and unconditional withdrawal by Israel from all the occupied territories, and pledges itself to assist Egypt, Syria and Jordan in liberating their occupied territories by every means.\n4\n'In this connexion, the restoration of the national rights of the Palestinian people is a basic prerequisite for the establishment of an equitable and lasting peace in the\narea. The struggle of the Palestinian people to recover their usurped homeland is an integral part of the struggle of all people against colonialism and racial discrimination and for self-determination. Member countries of the Conference call upon all States, and in particular the United States of America, to abstain from providing Israel with arms, or any political, economic or financial support which may enable it to continue its aggressive and expansionist policy.\n\n'The Conference gives its firm support to and expresses its solidarity with the Palestinian people in their sore trial and the heavy sacrifices it is making to recover its national dignity and entity.'\n108.\tAs long as the aggressive Zionist State is dispossessing the Palestinian people of their homeland and rights, and is illegally occupying territories of three Arab countries, the world will not witness peace, as this troubled situation could explode at any moment, exposing our civilization to the danger of devastation. Bahrain would like to see the United Nations playing its proper and effective role in world affairs and see the countries which hold in their hands the key to the solution of this dangerous situation take an active part in doing so rather than stand aloof as mere observers.\n109.\tThis year, the United Nations will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Bahrain is looking forward to participating ii this celebration. Bahrain attaches great importance to safeguarding human rights and fundamental freedoms for all peoples. It is significant to note in this respect that the new Constitution of Bahrain, which was approved by the Constituent Assembly, upholds the rights of the citizens of Bahrain in civil, political and social affairs. The Constitution of Bahrain is a solid foundation for a democratic life supported by both the people and the Government of Bahrain. One of the aims of the Constitution is to maintain the dignity and worth of the people of Bahrain and lead them to an honourable and fruitful life.\n110.\tThis year a major step towards world peace has been achieved by the signature of the cease-fire agreements in Viet-Nam. Nations all over the world have shown their relief at the cease-fire in that part of the world. Nevertheless, the situation in Indo-China is still precarious and may threaten the stability of political and economic life in that area. Accordingly, we hope that all parties involved will work towards the ending of hostilities and armed confrontation.\n111.\tIt is true that it is not in the interest of nations that the arms race should continue at a time when millions of people are living in misery and poverty. Statistics indicate that some $200,000 million a year are spent on military activities, while only half this amount-is spent on economic and social development. The world has not yet forgotten the destruction inflicted on human civilization by the last two world wars. So long as the arms race is not curbed, the threat of another world war will remain with us. The United Nations, through the goodwill and determination of its Members, can call a halt to the arms race and the production and stockpiling of destructive weapons. It is high time that the United Nations should play a more effective role in achieving general and complete disarmament and that Member States should meet their moral obligations towards the nations of the world, which are longing for peace and security.\n112.\tThe Indian Ocean is a vital area for the many nations who want it to be a zone of peace. The United Nations has declared that the Indian Ocean is a zone of peace [resolution 2832 (XXVI)] and should not be used as an arena for military activities which endanger the political and economic stability of the littoral and hinterland States. Bahrain, which declared its approval of this principle, appeals to all other nations to do the same and to refrain from jeopardizing the peace and stability of this area. Also, we believe that the Gulf area should also remain free from big-Power rivalries and foreign intervention.\n113.\tAnother aspect of global unrest is the policy of apartheid and racial discrimination. The United Nations has in the past spared no effort to combat these policies and practices through the resolutions that were adopted year after year. Nevertheless, these efforts have been in vain, mainly because those who carry out such practices persist in their wrong-doing and turn a deaf ear to all voices that condemn them. Moreover, these racist regimes are able to adhere to their vicious policies because of the moral and material support they receive from some other industrially advanced countries. The latter claim to be among those who laid the foundation of human rights, while at the same time they support racist regimes which suppress the indigenous populations and deny them their fundamental freedoms and inalienable human rights.\n114.\tColonialism and apartheid are crimes against humanity and can no longer be condoned. The international community must compel colonial and racist regimes to give up these odious practices.\n115.\tThe liberation movements in Africa are legitimate causes that must be supported and encouraged. Every nation on this earth has the right to self-determination, which, if denied, can be achieved through armed struggle. Bahrain confirms its support for the legitimate struggle of the peoples of Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola, Mozambique, Guinea-Bissau and the Cape Verde Islands.\n116.\tIn 1970, the United Nations initiated the Second United Nations Development Decade with a view to achieving the target of raising the national income of developing countries by 6 per cent. In order to achieve this objective there must be international co-operation, and in this respect the developed countries can help a great deal. Nobody can deny that the developing countries are primarily responsible for their own development. However, this should not prevent the developed countries from helping to improve the standard of living in the developing countries. The offer of technical assistance and the provision of financial aid can diminish the wide gap between the poor and the rich countries.\n117.\tThe increasing problems of the environment are placing a new challenge before those who are endeavouring\nto find solutions to combat them. No State whatsoever is immune from the problems of pollution of the environment. The United Nations has initiated an environmental programme and has set up a secretariat entrusted with the duty of following up the programme. It is hoped that all nations will co-operate amongst themselves and with the various international organizations in the struggle to combat the problems of pollution.\n118.\tNow that we are meeting in this grand Assembly to discuss the matters included in our agenda, which may exceed 100 items in number, we should look back on the work of our Organization to see whether it has achieved its aims and purposes, particularly the maintenance of international peace and security.\n119.\tThe United Nations has been exceptionally ineffective in maintaining international peace and security. To take one significant example, our Organization succeeded in repelling the aggression committed by Israel during the Suez war in 1956, while it has so far been unable to compel Israel to renounce the fruits of its aggression in 1967.\n120.\tIt is our fervent hope that the lessons of the past will be heeded and that the General Assembly will take effective measures to maintain and promote the aims and purposes of the United Nations. Meanwhile, I would take this opportunity to reiterate my country's firm support of the principles and ideals of the Charter and to proclaim its co-operation with the Secretary-General, who needs our help and whole-hearted assistance in the noble cause he is working for.","label":1}
{"text":"WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company.\"What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way,\" Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL\/Time Warner and IBM. Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. \"They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield,\" said Meade. Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. ILL-FATED BUSINESSES Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential.","label":0}
{"text":" The following is a conversation with Brian Johnson, founder of Kernel, a company that has developed devices that can monitor and record brain activity. And previously, he was the founder of BrainTree, a mobile payment company that acquired Venmo and then was acquired by PayPal and eBay. Quick mention of our sponsors, Forsigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN. Check them out in the description to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that this was a fun and memorable experience, wearing the Kernel FlowBrain interface in the beginning of this conversation, as you can see if you watch the video version of this episode. And there was a Ubuntu Linux machine sitting next to me collecting the data from my brain. The whole thing gave me hope that the mystery of the human mind will be unlocked in the coming decades as we begin to measure signals from the brain in a high bandwidth way. To understand the mind, we either have to build it or to measure it. Both are worth a try. Thanks to Brian and the rest of the Kernel team for making this little demo happen. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Brian Johnson. You ready, Lex? Yes, I'm ready. Do you just want to come in and put the interfaces on our heads? And then I will proceed to tell you a few jokes. So we have two incredible pieces of technology and a machine running Ubuntu 2004 in front of us. What are we doing? Are these going on our heads? They're going on our heads, yeah. And they will place it on our heads for proper alignment. Does this support giant heads? Because I kind of have a giant head. Is this just giant heads? As like an ego? Or are you saying physically? Both. I'm going to drop it on you. It's a nice massage. Yes. Okay, how does this feel? It's okay to move around? It feels, oh yeah. This feels awesome. It's a pretty good fit. Thank you. That feels good. So this is big head friendly. It suits you well, Lex. Thank you. I feel like I need to, I feel like when I wear this, I need to sound like Sam Harris. Calm, collected, eloquent. I feel smarter actually. I don't think I've ever felt quite as much like I'm part of the future as now. Have you ever worn a brain interface or had your brain imaged? Oh, never had my brain imaged. The only way I've analyzed my brain is by talking to myself and thinking. No direct data. Yeah. Yeah, that is definitely a brain interface that has a lot of blind spots. It has some blind spots. Yeah. Psychotherapy. That's right. All right. Are we recording? Yep, we're good. All right. So Lex, the objective of this, I'm going to tell you some jokes and your objective is to not smile, which as a Russian, you should have an edge. Make the motherland proud. I got you. Okay. Let's hear the jokes. Lex, and this is from the Colonel Crew. We've been working on a device that can read your mind and we would love to see your thoughts. Is that the joke? That's the opening. Okay. If I'm seeing the muscle activation correctly on your lips, you're not going to do well on this. Let's see. All right, here comes the first one. I'm screwed. Is this going to break the device? Is it resilient to laughter? Lex, what goes through a potato's brain? I got already failed. That's the hilarious opener. Okay. What? Tater thoughts. What kind of fish performs brain surgery? I don't know. A neural surgeon. And so we're getting data of everything that's happening in my brain right now? Lifetime, yeah. We're getting activation patterns of your entire cortex. I'm going to try to do better. I'll edit out all the parts where I laughed and Photoshop a serious face over me. You can recover. Yeah. All right. Lex, what do scholars eat when they're hungry? I don't know what. Academia nuts. That was pretty good. So what we'll do is, so you're wearing kernel flow, which is an interface built using technology called spectroscopy. So it's similar to what we wear wearables on the wrist using light. So using light are as you know, and we're using that to image. It's a functional imaging of brain activity. And so as your neurons fire electrically and chemically, it creates blood oxygenation levels when we're measuring that. And so you'll see in the reconstructions we do for you, you'll see your activation patterns in your brain as throughout this entire time we are wearing it. So in the reaction to the jokes and as we were sitting here talking, and so it's a, we're moving towards a real time feed of your cortical brain activity. So there's a bunch of things that are in contact with my skull right now. How many of them are there? And so how many of them are, what are they? What are the actual sensors? There's 52 modules and each module has one laser and six sensors. And they're the sensors fire in about a hundred picoseconds. And then the photons scatter and absorb in your brain. And then a few go in, a few come back out, a bunch go in, then a few come back out and we sense those photons and then we do the reconstruction for the activity. Overall there's about a thousand plus channels that are sampling your activity. How difficult is it to make it as comfortable as it is? Because it's surprisingly uncomfortable. I would not think it would be comfortable. Something that's measuring brain activity, I would not think it would be comfortable, but it is. I agree. In fact, I want to take this home. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. I think people are accustomed to being in big systems like fMRI where there's 120 decibel sounds and you're in a claustrophobic encasement or EEG, which is just painful or surgery. And so yes, I agree that this is a convenient option to be able to just put on your head. It measures your brain activity in the contextual environment you choose. So if we want to have it during a podcast, if we want to be at home in a business setting, it's freedom to be where to record your brain activity in the setting that you choose. Yeah, but sort of from an engineer perspective, are these, what is it? There's a bunch of different modular parts and there's like a rubber band thing where they mold to the shape of your head. That's right. So we built this version of the mechanical design to accommodate most adult heads. But I have a giant head and it fits fine. It fits well actually. So I don't think I have an average head. Maybe I feel much better about my head now. Maybe I'm more average than I thought. Okay, so what else is there? Interesting, you could say while it's on our heads. I can keep this on the whole time. This is kind of awesome. And it's amazing for me as a fan of Ubuntu, I use Ubuntu Mate, you guys should use that too. It's amazing to have code running to the side measuring stuff and collecting data. I feel like much more important now that my data is being recorded. You know when you have a good friend that listens to you, that actually is listening to you? This is what I feel like a much better friend because it's accurately listening to me, Ubuntu. What a cool perspective. I hadn't thought about that of feeling understood. Yeah, heard. Yeah, heard deeply by the mechanical system that is recording your brain activity versus the human that you're engaging with. That your mind immediately goes to that there's this dimensionality and depth of understanding of this software system which you're intimately familiar with. And now you're able to communicate with this system in ways that you couldn't before. Yeah, I feel heard. Yeah, I mean, I guess what's interesting about this is your intuitions are spot on. Most people have intuitions about brain interfaces that they've grown up with this idea of people moving cursors on the screen or typing or changing the channel or skipping a song. It's primarily been anchored on control. And I think the more relevant understanding of brain interfaces or neural imaging is that it's a measurement system. And once you have numbers for a given thing, a seemingly endless number of possibilities emerge around that of what to do with those numbers. So before you tell me about the possibilities, this was an incredible experience. I can keep this on for another two hours, but I'm being told that for a bunch of reasons, just because we probably want to keep the data small and visualize it nicely for the final product. We want to cut this off and take this amazing helmet away from me. So Brian, thank you so much for this experience. And let's continue without helmetless. All right. So that was an incredible experience. Can you maybe speak to what kind of opportunities that opens up that stream of data, that rich stream of data from the brain? First, I'm curious, what is your reaction? What comes to mind when you put that on your head? What does it mean to you and what possibilities emerge and what significance might it have? I'm curious where your orientation is at. Well, for me, I'm really excited by the possibility of various information about my body, about my mind being converted into data such that data can be used to create products that make my life better. So that to me is really exciting possibility. Even just like a Fitbit that measures, I don't know, some very basic measurements about your body is really cool. But it's the bandwidth of information, the resolution of that information is very crude, so it's not very interesting. The possibility of recording, of just building a data set coming in a clean way and a high bandwidth way from my brain opens up all kinds of, you know, at the very, I was kind of joking while we were talking, but it's not really, is like I feel heard in the sense that it feels like the full richness of the information coming from my mind is actually being recorded by the machine. I mean, there's a, I can't quite put it into words, but there is genuinely for me, there's not some kind of joke about me being a robot. It just genuinely feels like I'm being heard in a way that's going to improve my life. As long as the thing that's on the other end can do something useful with that data. But even the recording itself is like, once you record, it's like taking a picture. That moment is forever saved in time. Now a picture cannot allow you to step back into that world, but perhaps recording your brain is a much higher resolution thing, much more personal recording of that information than a picture that would allow you to step back into that, where you were in that particular moment in history and then map out a certain trajectory to tell you certain things about yourself that can open up all kinds of applications. Of course there's health that I consider, but honestly, to me, the exciting thing is just being heard. My state of mind, the level of focus, all those kinds of things being heard. What I heard you say is you have an entirety of lived experience, some of which you can communicate in words and in body language, some of which you feel internally, which cannot be captured in those communication modalities. This measurement system captures both the things you can try to articulate in words, maybe in a lower dimensional space using one word, for example, to communicate focus, when it really may be represented in a 20 dimensional space of this particular kind of focus and that this information is being captured. So it's a closer representation to the entirety of your experience captured in a dynamic fashion that is not just a static image of your conscious experience. Yeah, that's the promise. That was the feeling and it felt like the future. So it was a pretty cool experience. And from the sort of mechanical perspective, it was cool to have an actual device that feels pretty good. It doesn't require me to go into the lab. And also the other thing I was feeling, there's a guy named Andrew Huberman. He's a friend of mine, amazing podcast. People should listen to a Huberman Lab podcast. We're working on a paper together about eye movement and so on. And he's a neuroscientist and I'm a data person, machine learning person. We're both excited by how much the data measurements of the human mind, the brain and all the different metrics that come from that can be used to understand human beings and in a rigorous scientific way. So the other thing I was thinking about is how this could be turned into a tool for science. Sort of not just personal science, not just like Fitbit style. Like how am I doing my personal metrics of health, but doing larger scale studies of human behavior and so on. So like data not at the scale of an individual, but data at the scale of many individuals or a large number of individuals. So it's personal being heard was exciting and also just for science is exciting. It's very easy. There's a very powerful thing to it being so easy to just put on that you can scale much easier. If you think about that second thing you said about the science of the brain, most we've done a pretty good job. Like we, the human race has done a pretty good job figuring out how to quantify the things around us from distance stars to calories and steps and our genome. So we can measure and quantify pretty much everything in the known universe except for our minds. And we can do these one-offs if we're going to get an fMRI scan or do something with a low res EEG system, but we haven't done this at population scale. And so if you think about human thought or human cognition is probably the single largest raw input material into society at any given moment. It's our conversations with ourselves and with other people and we have this raw input that we haven't been able to measure yet. And if you, when I think about it through that frame, it's remarkable. It's almost like we live in this wild wild west of unquantified communications within ourselves and between each other when everything else has been grounded. For example, I know if I buy an appliance at the store or on a website, I don't need to look at the measurements on the appliance to make sure it can fit through my door. That's an engineered system of appliance manufacturing and construction. Everyone's agreed upon engineering standards and we don't have engineering standards around cognition. It has not entered as a formal engineering discipline that enables us to scaffold in society with everything else we're doing, including consuming news, our relationships, politics, economics, education, all the above. And so to me, the most significant contribution that kernel technology has to offer would be the formal introduction to the formal engineering of cognition as it relates to everything else in society. I love that idea that you kind of think that there is just this ocean of data that's coming from people's brains as being in a crude way, reduced down to like tweets and texts and so on. So it's a very hardcore, many scale compression of actual the raw data, but maybe you can comment because you're using the word cognition. I think the first step is to get the brain data, but is there a leap to be taking to sort of interpreting that data in terms of cognition? So is your idea is basically you need to start collecting data at scale from the brain and then we start to really be able to take little steps along the path to actually measuring some deep sense of cognition because as I'm sure you know, we understand a few things, but we don't understand most of what makes up cognition. This has been one of the most significant challenges of building kernel and kernel wouldn't exist if I wasn't able to fund it initially by myself because when I engage in conversations with investors, the immediate thought is what is the killer app? And of course, I understand that heuristic, that's what they're looking at is they're looking to de-risk is the product solved? Is there a customer base? Are people willing to pay for it? How does it compare to competing options? And in the case with brain interfaces, when I started the company, there was no known path to even build a technology that could potentially become mainstream. And then once we figured out the technology, we could commence having conversations with investors and it became what is the killer app? And so what has been, so I funded the first $53 million of the company and to raise the round of funding, the first one we did, I spoke to 228 investors. One said yes. It was remarkable and it was mostly around this concept around what is a killer app. And so internally, the way we think about it is we think of the go-to-market strategy much more like the Drake equation, where if we can build technology that has the characteristics of it has the data quality is high enough, it meets some certain threshold, cost, accessibility, comfort, it can be worn in contextual environments. If it meets the criteria of being a mass market device, then the responsibility that we have is to figure out how to create the algorithm that enables humans to then find value with it. So the analogy is like brain interfaces are like early 90s of the internet. You want to populate an ecosystem with a certain number of devices. You want a certain number of people who play around with them, who do experiments of certain data collection parameters. You want to encourage certain mistakes from experts and non-experts. These are all critical elements that ignite discovery. And so we believe we've accomplished the first objective of building technology that reaches those thresholds. And now it's the Drake equation component of how do we try to generate 20 years of value discovery in a two or three year time period? How do we compress that? So just to clarify, so when you mean the Drake equation, which for people who don't know, I don't know why you, if you listen to this, I bring up aliens every single conversation. So I don't know how you would know what the Drake equation is, but you mean like the killer app, it would be one alien civilization equation. So meaning like, this is in search of an application that's impactful, transformative. By the way, it should be, we need to come up with a better term than killer app as a, as a, it's also violent, right? It's very violent, you can go like viral app. That's horrible too, right? It's some very, uh, inspiringly impactful application. How about that? No. Okay. So ballistic with killer app. That's fine. Nobody's, but I concur with you. I dislike the chosen words in capturing the concept. You know, it's, it's one of those sticky things that, uh, is as effective to use in the tech world. So when you're now become a communicator outside of the tech world, especially when you're talking about software and hardware and artificial intelligence applications, it sounds horrible. Yeah, no, it's interesting. I, I actually regret now having called attention to cyber regret having used that word in this conversation because it's something I would not normally do. I, I used it in order to create a bridge of shared understanding of how others would, what terminology others would use. Yeah. But yeah, I concur. Let's go with a impactful application or value creation, value creation, something people love using. There we go. That's it. Love app. Okay. So what, uh, do you have any ideas? So you're basically creating a framework where there's the possibility of a discovery of, uh, an application that people love using is do you have ideas? We've began to play a fun game internally where when we have these discussions or we begin circ circling around this concept of, does anybody have an idea? Does anyone have intuitions? And if we see the conversation starting to veer in that direction, we flag it and say human intuition alert, stop it. And so we really want to focus on the algorithm of there's a natural process of human discovery that that when you populate a system with devices and you give people the opportunity to play around with it in expected and unexpected ways, we are thinking that is a much better system of discovery than us exercising intuitions. And it's interesting. We're also seeing a few neuroscientists who have been, have been talking to us while I was speaking to this one young associate professor and I approached a conversation and said, Hey, we have these five data streams that we're pulling off. When you hear that, what weighted value do you add to each data source? Like which one do you think is going to be valuable for your objectives and which one's not? And he said, I don't care. Just give me the data. All I care about is my machine learning model. But importantly, he did not have a theory of mind. He did not come to the table and say, I think the brain operates in this way and these reasons or have these functions. He didn't care. He just wanted the data. And we're seeing that more and more that certain people are devaluing human intuitions for good reasons, as we've seen in machine learning over the past couple of years. And we're doing the same in our value creation market strategy. So more collect more data, clean data, make the product such that the collection of data is easy and, and, and fun. And then the rest will just spring to life through humans playing around with them. Our objective is to create the most valuable data collection system of the brain ever. And with that, then applying all the best tools of machine learning and other techniques to extract out, you know, to try to find insight. But yes, our objective is really to systematize the discovery process because we, we can't put definite timeframes on discovery. The brain is complicated and science is not a business strategy. And so we really need to figure out how to, this is the difficulty of bringing, bringing, you know, technology like this to market. It's why most of the time it just ling, it languishes in academia for quite some time, but we hope that we will over, you know, cross over and make this mainstream in the coming years. The thing was cool to wear, but what's, are you chasing a good reason for millions of people to put this on their head and keep on their head regularly? Is there, like who is going to discover that reason? Is it going to be people just kind of organically or is there going to be a Angry Birds style application that's just too exciting to, to not use? If I think through the things that have changed my life most significantly over the past few years when I started wearing a wearable on my wrist that would give me data about my heart rate, heart rate variability, respiration rate, metabolic approximations, et cetera. For the first time in my life, I had access to information, sleep patterns that were highly impactful. And they told me, for example, if I eat close to bedtime, I'm not going to get deep sleep and not getting deep sleep means you have all these follow-on consequences in life. And so it opened up this window of understanding of myself that I cannot self-interest back and deduce these things. This is information that was available to be acquired, but it just wasn't. I would have to dig an expensive sleep study. Then it's an end, like one night and that's not good enough to look at, to run all my trials. But if you look just at the information that one can acquire on their wrist, and now you're applying it to the entire cortex on the brain, and you say, what kind of information could we acquire? It opens up a whole new universe of possibilities. For example, we did this internal study at Kernel where I wore a prototype device and we were measuring the cognitive effects of sleep. So I had a device measuring my sleep. I performed with 13 of my coworkers. We performed four cognitive tasks over 13 sessions. And we focused on reaction time, impulse control, short-term memory, and then a resting state task. And with mine, we found, for example, that my impulse control was independently correlated with my sleep outside of behavioral measures of my ability to play the game. The point of the study was I had the brain study I did at Kernel confirmed my life experience. That if my deep sleep determined whether or not I would be able to resist temptation the following day. And my brain did show that as one example. And so if you start thinking, if you actually have data on yourself on your entire cortex, you can control the settings, I think there's probably a large number of things that we could discover about ourselves. Very, very small and very, very big. Just for example, when you read news, what's going on? Like when you use social media, when you use news, all the ways we allocate attention with the computer. That seems like a compelling place to where you would want to put on Kernel. By the way, what is it called? Kernel Flux? Kernel? Flow. We have two technologies, you or Flow. Flow. Okay. So when you put on the Kernel Flow, it seems like to be a compelling time and place to do it is when you're behind a desk behind a computer. Because you could probably wear it for prolonged periods of time as you're taking in content. And there could be a lot of, because so much of our lives happens in the digital world now. But kind of coupling the information about the human mind with the consumption and behaviors in the digital world might give us a lot of information about the effects of the way we behave and navigate the digital world to the actual physical space effects on our body. It's interesting to think in terms of both like for work, I'm a big fan of, so Cal Newport has ideas of deep work that I spend with few exceptions, I try to spend the first two hours of every day. Usually if I'm like at home and have nothing on my schedule is going to be up to eight hours of deep work of focus, zero distraction. And for me to analyze the, I mean, I'm very aware of the waning of that, the ups and downs of that, and it's almost like you're surfing the ups and downs of that as you're doing programming, as you're doing thinking about particular problems, you're trying to visualize things in your mind, you start trying to stitch them together. You're trying to, when there's a dead end about an idea, you have to kind of calmly like walk back and start again, all those kinds of processes. It'd be interesting to get data on what my mind is actually doing. And also recently started doing, I just talked to Sam Harris a few days ago and been building up to that. I started using, started meditating using his app, waking up, very much recommend it. And be interested in getting data on that because it's, you're very, it's like you're removing all the noise from your head and you very much, it's an active process of active noise removal, active noise canceling, like the headphones. And it'd be interesting to see what is going on in the mind before the meditation, during it and after all those kinds of things. And you, all of your examples, it's interesting that everyone who's designed an experience for you. So whether it be the meditation app or the deep work or all the things you mentioned, they constructed this product with a certain number of knowns. Now, what if we expanded the number of knowns by 10 X or 20 X or 30 X, they would reconstruct their product, quote, incorporate those knowns. So it'd be, and so this is the dimensionality that I think is the promising aspect is that people will be able to use this quantification, use this information to build more effective products. And this is, I'm not talking about better products to advertise to you or manipulate you. But our focus is helping people, individuals have this contextual awareness and this quantification and then to engage with others who are seeking to improve people's lives. The objective is betterment across ourselves individually and also with each other. Yeah. So it's a nice data stream to have if you're building an app, like if you're building a podcast listening app, it would be nice to know data about the listener so that like if you're bored or you fell asleep, maybe pause the podcast. Yeah, or like really dumb, just very simple applications that could just improve the quality of the experience of using the app. I'm imagining if you have your neurome, this is Lex and there's a statistical representation of you and you engage with the app and it says, Lex, you're best to engage with this meditation exercise in the following settings. At this time of day, after eating this kind of food or not eating, fasting with this level of blood glucose and this kind of night's sleep. But all these data combined to give you this contextually relevant experience, just like we do with our sleep. You've optimized your entire life based upon what information you can acquire and know about yourself. And so the question is, how much do we really know of the things going around us? And I would venture to guess in my own, my life life experience, I capture, my self-awareness captures an extremely small percent of the things that actually influenced my conscious and unconscious experience. Well, in some sense, the data would help encourage you to be more self-aware, not just because you trust everything the data is saying, but is it'll give you a prod to start investigating. Like I would love to get like a rating, like a ranking of all the things I do and what are the things, this is probably important to do without the data, but the data will certainly help. It's like rank all the things you do in life and which ones make you feel shitty, which ones make you feel good. Like you're talking about evening, Brian, like this is a good example. We like, I do pig out at night as well and it never makes you feel good. Like you're in a safe space. This is a safe space. Let's hear it. No, I definitely have much less self-control at night and it's interesting. And the same, you know, people might criticize this, but I know my own body. I know when I eat carnivore, just eat meat, I feel much better than if I eat more carbs. The more carbs I eat, the worse I feel. I don't know why that is. There is science supporting, but I'm not leaning on science. I'm leaning on personal experience and that's really important. I don't need to read. I'm not going to go on a whole rant about nutrition science, but many of those studies are very flawed. They're doing their best, but nutrition science is a very difficult field of study because humans are so different and the mind has so much impact on the way your body behaves. And it's so difficult from a scientific perspective to conduct really strong studies that you have to be almost like a scientist of one. You have to do these studies on yourself. That's the best way to understand what works for you or not. And I don't understand why, because it sounds unhealthy, but eating only meat always makes me feel good. Just eat meat. That's it. And I don't have any allergies and you know, that kind of stuff. I'm not full like Jordan Peterson where like if he like deviates a little bit that he goes off like deviates a little bit from the carnivore diet, he goes off like the cliff. No, I can, I can have like chalk. I can, I can go off the diet. I feel fine. It's not, it's a, it's a gradual, uh, uh, it's a gradual worsening of how I feel, but what I eat only meat, I feel great. And it'd be nice to be reminded of that. Like there's a very simple fact that I feel good when I eat carnivore. And I think that repeats itself in all kinds of experiences. Like I feel really good, uh, when I exercise, not, I hate exercise, okay. But in the rest of the day, the, uh, the impact it has on my mind and the clarity of mind and the experiences and the happiness and all those kinds of things, I feel really good. And to be able to concretely express that through data would be, would be nice. It would be a nice reminder, almost like a statement, like remember what feels good and whatnot. And there could be things like, uh, that I'm not many things like you're, you're suggesting that I could not be aware of. There might be sitting right in front of me that makes me feel really good and make me feel not good and the data would show that. I agree with you. I've actually employed the same strategy. I, I fired my mind entirely from being responsible for constructing my diet. And so I started doing a program where I now track over 200 biomarkers every 90 days and it captures, of course, the things you would expect like cholesterol, but also DNA methylation and all kinds of things about my body, all the processes that make up me. And then I let that data generate the shopping lists. And so I never actually asked my mind what it wants. It's entirely what my body is reporting that it wants. And so I call this goal alignment within Brian and there's 200 plus actors that I'm currently asking their opinion of. And so I'm asking my liver, how are you doing? And it's expressing via the biomarkers. And so then I construct that diet and I only eat those foods until my next testing round. And that has changed my life more than I think anything else because in the demotion of my conscious mind that I gave primacy to my entire life, it led me astray because like you're saying the mind then goes out into the world and it navigates the dozens of different dietary regimens people put together in books. And it's all has their, all has their supporting science in certain contextual settings, but it's not N of one. And like you're saying, this dietary really is an N of one. What people have published scientifically of course can be used for nice groundings, but it changes when you get to an N of one level. And so that's what gets me excited about brain interfaces is if I could do the same thing for my brain where I can stop asking my conscious mind for its advice or for its decision making, which is flawed. And I'd rather just look at this data that, and I've never had better health markers in my life than when I stopped actually asking myself to be in charge of it. The idea of a demotion of the conscious mind is such a sort of engineering way of phrasing like meditation. I mean that's what we're doing, right? Yeah. That's beautiful. That means really beautifully put. By the way, testing round, what does that look like? What's that? Well, you mentioned. Yeah, the very, the tests I do. Yes. So that includes a complete blood panel. I do a microbiome test. I do a food inflammation, a diet induced inflammation. So I look for X-satokine expressions. So foods that produce inflammatory reactions. I look at my neuroendocrine systems. I look at all my neurotransmitters. I do, yeah, there's several micronutrient tests to see how I'm looking at the very various nutrients. So that's self report of like how you feel, you know, almost like, you can't demote your conscious, you still exist within your conscious mind. Right? So that lived experience is a lot of value. So how do you measure that? I do a temporal sampling over some duration of time. So I'll think through how I feel over a week, over a month, over three months. I don't do a temporal sampling of if I'm at the grocery store in front of a cereal box and be like, you know what, Captain Crunch is probably the right thing for me today because I'm feeling like I need a little fun in my life. Yeah. And so it's a temporal sampling. If the data set's large enough, then I smooth out the function of my natural oscillations of how I feel about life where some days I may feel upset or depressed or down or whatever. And I don't want those moments to then rule my decision-making. That's why the demotion happens. And it says, really, if you're looking at health over a 90-day period of time, all my 200 voices speak up on that interval. And they're all given voice to say, this is how I'm doing and this is what I want. And so it really is an accounting system for everybody. So that's why I think that if you think about the future of being human, there's two things I think that are really going on. One is the design, manufacturing, and distribution of intelligence is heading towards zero, on a cost curve over a certain design, over a certain timeframe. But our ability to, you know, evolution produced us an intelligent, a form of intelligence. We are now designing our own intelligent systems. And the design, manufacturing, and distribution of that intelligence over a certain timeframe is going to go to a cost of zero. Design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligent costs is going to zero. For example. Again, just give me a second. That's brilliant. Okay. So, you know, in evolution is doing the design, manufacturing, and distribution of intelligence. And now we are doing the design, manufacturing, and distribution of intelligence. And the cost of that is going to zero. That's a very nice way of looking at life on earth. So if that that's going on and then now in parallel to that, then you say, okay, what then happens if when that cost curve is heading to zero, our existence becomes a goal alignment problem, a goal alignment function. And so the same thing I'm doing where I'm doing goal alignment within myself are these 200 biomarkers where I'm saying when, when Brian exists on a data basis and this entity is deciding what to eat and what to do and et cetera, it's not just my conscious mind which is opining, it's 200 biological processes and there's a whole bunch of more voices involved. So in that equation, we're going to increasingly automate the things that we spend high energy on today because it's easier. And now we're going to then negotiate the terms and conditions of intelligent life. Now we say conscious existence because we're biased because that's what we have, but it will be the largest computational exercise in history because you're now doing goal alignment with planet earth within yourself, with each other, within all the intelligent agents we're building bots and other voice assistants. You basically have a trillions and trillions of agents working on the negotiation of goal alignment. Yeah, this, this is in fact true. And what was the second thing? That was it. The cost, the design, manufacturing, distribution of intelligence going to zero, which then means what's really going on? What are we really doing? We're negotiating the terms and conditions of existence. Do you worry about the survival of this process? That life as we know it on earth comes to an end or at least intelligent life that as the cost goes to zero, something happens where all of that intelligence is thrown in the trash by something like nuclear war or development of AGI systems that are very dumb, not AGI I guess, but AIS system, it's the paperclip thing with unmasked is dumb, but has unintended consequences to where it destroys human civilization. Do you worry about those kinds of things? I mean, it's, it's unsurprising that a new thing comes into this fear of human consciousness. Humans identify the foreign object in this case, artificial intelligence, our amygdala fires up and says, scary foreign, we should be apprehensive about this. And so it makes sense from a biological perspective that humans, the knee-jerk reaction is fear. What I don't think has been properly weighted with that is that we are the first generation of intelligent beings on this earth that has been able to look out over their expected lifetime and see there is a real possibility of evolving into entirely novel forms of consciousness. So different that it would be totally unrecognizable to us today. We don't have words for it. We can't hint at it. We can't point at it. We can't, you can't look in the sky and see that thing that is shining. We're going to go up there. You cannot even create an aspirational statement about it. And instead we've had this knee-jerk reaction of fear about everything that could go wrong. So in my estimation, this should be the defining aspiration of all intelligent life on earth that we would aspire. That basically every generation surveys the landscape of possibilities that are afforded given the technological, cultural and other contextual situation that they're in. We're in this context. We haven't yet identified this and said, this is unbelievable. We should carefully think this thing through, not just of mitigating the things that wipe us out, but like we have this potential. And so we just haven't given a voice to it, even though it's within this realm of possibilities. So you're excited about the possibility of superintelligence systems and what the opportunities that bring. I mean, there's parallels to this. You think about people before the internet as the internet was coming to life. I mean, there's kind of a fog through which you can't see. What does the future look like? Predicting collective intelligence, which I don't think we're understanding that we're living through that now is that there's now, we've in some sense stopped being individual intelligences and become much more like collective intelligences because ideas travel much, much faster now. And they can in a viral way, like sweep across the populations. And so it's almost, I mean, it almost feels like a thought is had by many people now, thousands or millions of people as opposed to an individual person. And that's changed everything. But to me, I don't think we're realizing how much that actually changed people or societies. But like to predict that before the internet would have been very difficult. And in that same way, we're sitting here with the fog before us thinking what is superintelligence systems, how is that going to change the world? What is increasing the bandwidth, like plugging our brains into this whole thing? How is that going to change the world? And it seems like it's a fog, you don't know. And it could be, it could, whatever comes to be could destroy the world. We could be the last generation, but it also could transform in ways that creates a, you know, an incredibly fulfilling life experience that's unlike anything we've ever experienced. It might involve the solution of ego and consciousness and so on. You're no longer one individual. It might be more, you know, that might be a certain kind of death and ego death, but the experience might be really exciting and enriching. Maybe we'll live in a virtual, like it's like, it's, it's, it's funny to think about a bunch of sort of hypothetical questions of would it be more fulfilling to live in a virtual world? Like if you were able to plug your brain in, in a very dense way into a video game, like which world would you want to live in? In the video game or in the physical world? For most of us, we kind of toying with the idea of the video game, but we still want to live in the physical world, have friendships and relationships in the physical world. But we don't know that again, it's a fog and maybe, maybe in a hundred years we're all living inside a video game. Hopefully not Call of Duty. Hopefully more like, like Sims five, which, which version is it on for you individually though? Does it make you sad that your brain ends, that you die one day very soon, that the whole thing that, that, that, that data source just goes offline sooner than you would like? That's a complicated question. I would have answered it differently in different times in my life. I, you know, I had chronic depression for 10 years. And so in that 10 year time period, I desperately wanted lights to be off. And the thing that made it even worse is I was in a religious, I was born into a religion. It was the only reality I ever understood. And it's difficult to articulate to people when you're born into that kind of reality and it's the only reality you're exposed to, you are literally blinded to the existence of other realities because it's so much the in-group out-group thing. And so in that situation, it was not only that I desperately wanted lights out forever, it was that I couldn't have lights out forever. It was that there was an afterlife and this afterlife had this system that would either penalize or, or reward you for your behaviors. And so it was almost like this is indescribable hopelessness of not only being in hopeless despair of not wanting to exist, but then also being forced to be, to exist. And so there was a duration of my time, of a duration of life where I'd say like, yes, I have no remorse for lights being out and actually wanted more than anything in the entire world. There are other times where I'm looking out at the future and I say, this is an opportunity for future evolving human conscious experience that is beyond my ability to understand. And I jump out of bed and I race to work and I can't think about anything else. But I think the reality for me is, I don't know what it's like to be in your head, but in my head, when I wake up in the morning, I don't say, good morning, Brian, I'm so happy to see you. I'm sure you're just going to be beautiful to me today. You're not going to make a huge long list of everything you should be anxious about. You're not going to repeat that list to me 400 times. You're not going to have me relive all the regrets I've made in life. I'm sure you're not doing any of that. You're just going to just help me along all day long. It's a brutal environment in my brain. And we've just become normalized to this environment that we just accept that this is what it means to be human. But if we look at it, if we try to muster as much soberness as we can about the realities of being human, it's brutal if it is for me. And so am I sad that the brain may be off one day? It depends on the contextual setting. What moment are you asking me that? My mind is so fickle and this is why, again, I don't trust my conscious mind. I have been given realities. I was given a religious reality that was a video game and then I figured out it was not a real reality. And then I lived in a depressive reality which delivered this terrible hopelessness. That wasn't a real reality. Then I discovered behavioral psychology and I figured out how biased, 188 chronicle biases and how my brain is distorting reality all the time. I have gone from one reality to another. I don't trust reality. I don't trust realities are given to me. And so to try to make a decision on what I value or not value that future state, I don't trust my response. So not fully listening to the conscious mind at any one moment as the ultimate truth, but allowing you to go up and down as it does and just kind of being observing it. Yes. I assume that whatever my conscious mind delivers up to my awareness is wrong on pond landing. And I just need to figure out where it's wrong, how it's wrong, how wrong it is, and then try to correct for it as best I can. But I assume that on impact it's mistaken in some critical ways. Is there something you can say by way of advice when the mind is depressive, when the conscious mind serves up something that, you know, dark thoughts, how you deal with that, like how in your own life you've overcome that and others who are experienced in that can overcome it? Two things. One, that those depressive states are biochemical states. It's not you. And the suggestions that these things that this state delivers to you about suggestion of the hopelessness of life or the meaninglessness of it, or that you should hit the eject button, that's a false reality. And that it's when I completely understand the rational decision to commit suicide. It is not lost to me at all that that is an irrational situation. But the key is when you're in that situation, those thoughts are landing to be able to say, thank you, you're not real. I know you're not real. And so I'm in a situation where for whatever reason I'm having this neurochemical state, but that state can be altered. And so again, it goes back to the realities of the difficulties of being human. And like when I was trying to solve my depression, I tried literally, if you name it, I tried it systematically and nothing would fix it. And so this is what gives me hope with brain interfaces, for example, like could I have numbers on my brain? Can I see what's going on? I go to the doctor and it's like, how do you feel? I don't know. Terrible. Like on a scale from one to 10, how bad do you want to commit suicide? 10. Yeah, at this moment. Here's his bottle. How much should I take? Well, I don't know. Yeah, it's very, very crude. And as data opens up the, yeah, it opens up the possibility of really helping in those dark moments to first understand the ways, the ups and downs of those dark moments. On the complete flip side of that, I am very conscious in my own brain and deeply, deeply grateful that what there, it's almost like a chemistry thing, a biochemistry thing that I go many times throughout the day. I'll look at like this cup and I'll be overcome with joy how amazing it is to be alive. Like I actually think I'm, my biochemistry is such that it's not as common. Like I've talked to people and I don't think that's that common. Like it's a, and it's not a rational thing at all. It's like, I feel like I'm on drugs and I'll just be like, whoa. And a lot of people talk about like the meditative experience will allow you to sort of, you know, look at some basic things like the movement of your hand as deeply joyful because it's like that's life. But I get that from just looking at a cup. Like I'm waiting for the coffee to brew. And I'll just be like, fuck, life is awesome. And I'll sometimes tweet that, but then I'll like regret it later. Like, God damn it. You're so ridiculous. But yeah. But that is purely chemistry. There's no rational, it doesn't fit with the rest of my life. I have all this shit. I'm always late to stuff. I'm always like, there's all stuff, you know, I'm super self critical, like really self critical about everything I do. To the point I will almost hate everything I do, but there's this engine of joy for life outside of all that. And that has to be chemistry. And this flip side of that is what depression probably is, is the opposite of that feeling of, like, cause I bet you that feeling of the cup being amazing is, would save anybody in a state of depression. Like that would be like fresh. You're in a desert and it's a drink of water. Shit man. The brain is a, it would be nice to understand where that's coming from. To be able to understand how you hit those lows and those highs that have nothing to do with the actual reality. It has to do with some very specific aspects of how you maybe see the world. Maybe it could be just like basic habits you engage in and then it's hard to walk along the line to find those experiences of joy. And this goes back to the discussion we're having of human cognition is in volume, the largest input of raw material into society. And it's not quantified. We have no bearings on it. And so we just, you wonder, we both articulated some of the challenges we have in our own mind and it's likely that others would say, I have something similar. And you wonder when you look at society, what, how does that contribute to all the other compound or problems that we're experiencing? How does that blind us to the opportunities we could be looking at? And so it really, it has this potential distortion effect on reality that just makes everything worse. And I hope if we can put some, if we can assign some numbers to these things, just to get our bearings. So we're aware of what's going on. If we could find greater stabilization in how we conduct our lives and how we build society, it might be the thing that enables us to scaffold. Because we've really, again, we've done enough, humans have done a fantastic job systematically scaffolding technology and science and institutions. It's human, it's our own selves, which we have not been able to scaffold. We are the one part of this intelligence infrastructure that remains unchanged. Is there something you could say about coupling this brain data with not just the basic human experience, but say an experience you mentioned sleep, but the wildest experience, which is psychedelics. Is there, and there's been quite a few studies now that are being approved and run, which is exciting from a scientific perspective on psychedelics. Do you think, what do you think happens to the brain on psychedelics? And how can data about this help us understand it? And when you're on DMT, do you see else? And can we get, can we convert that into data? Can you add aliens in there? Yeah, aliens, definitely. Do you actually meet aliens and elves are elves, the aliens, I'm asking for a few Austin friends yet that they're convinced that they've actually met the elves. What are elves like? Are they friendly? Are they helping? I haven't met them personally. Are they like the Smurfs of like they're like they're industrious and they have different skill sets and. Yeah, I think they're very, they're very critical as friends. They're trolls, the elves are trolls. No, but they care about you. So there's a bunch of different version of trolls. There's a loving trolls that are harsh on you, but they want you to be better. And there's trolls that just enjoy the, your destruction. And I think they're the ones that care for you. Like I think they're criticism for my, see I'm talking, I haven't met them directly. It's like a friend of a friend. Yeah, if you gave them a telephone. Yeah, a bit of a, and the whole point is that in psychedelics and certainly in DMT, this is where the brain data versus word data fails, which is, you know, words can't convey the experience. Most people that you can be poetic and so on, but it really does not convey the experience of what it actually means to meet the elves. To me, what baselines this conversation is imagine if you, if we were interested in the health of your heart and we started and said, okay, Lex, self-interests, tell me how's the health of your heart. And you sit there and you close your eyes and you think, feels all right. Like things seem, things feel okay. And then you went to the cardiologist and the cardiologist like, Hey Lex, you know, tell me how you feel. Like, actually what I really like you to do is do an EKG and a blood panel and look at arterial plaques and let's look at my cholesterol. And there's like five to 10 studies you would do. They then give you this report and say, here's the quantified health of your heart. Now with this data, I'm going to prescribe the following regime of exercise and maybe I'll put you on a statin, like, et cetera. But the protocol is based upon this data. You would think the cardiologist is out of their mind if they just gave you a bottle of statins based upon you're like, well, I think something's kind of wrong. And they're just, just kind of experiment and see what happens. But that's what we do with our mental health today. So you're, it's, it's kind of absurd. And so if you look at psychedelics, uh, to have, again, to be able to measure the brain and get a baseline state and then to measure during a psychedelic experience and post a psychedelic experience and then do it longitudinally, you now have a quantification of what's going on. And so you could then pose questions. What molecule is appropriate at what dosages, uh, at what frequency in what contextual environment, what happens when I have this diet with this molecule, this experience, all the experimentation you do when you have good sleep data or HRV. And so that's what I think happens. What we could potentially do with psychedelics is we could add this level of sophistication that is not in the industry currently, and it may improve the outcomes people experience. It may improve the safety and efficacy. And so that's what I hope we are able to achieve. And it would transform mental health because we would finally have numbers to work with to baseline ourselves. And then if you think about it, we, when we talk about things related to the mind, we talk about the modality, we use words like meditation or psychedelics or, or something else because we can't talk about a marker in the brain. We can't use a word to say, we can't talk about cholesterol. We don't talk about plaque in the arteries. We don't talk about HRV. And so if we have numbers, then the solutions get mapped to numbers instead of the modalities being the thing we talk about. Meditation just does good things in a crude fashion. So in your blog post, zero principle thinking, good title, you ponder how do people come up with a truly original ideas? What, what's your thoughts on this as a human and as a person who's measuring brain data? Zero principles are building blocks. First principles are understanding of system laws. So if you take, for example, I can Sherlock Holmes, he's a first principles thinker. So he says, once you've eliminated the impossible, anything that remains, however improbable is true. Whereas Dirk Gently, the holistic detective by Douglas Adams says, I don't like eliminating the impossible. So when someone says from a first principles perspective and they, they're trying to assume the fewest number of things within a given timeframe. And so when I, after brain tree Venmo, I set my mind to the question of what single thing can I do that would maximally increase the probability that the human race thrives beyond what we can even imagine. And I found that in my conversations with others in the books I read, in my own deliberations, I had a missing piece of the puzzle because I didn't feel like over, yeah, I didn't feel like the future could be deduced from first principles thinking. And that's when I read the book Zero, a biography of a dangerous idea. And I, I really good book by the way. It's I think it's my favorite book I've ever read. It's also a really interesting number zero. And I wasn't aware that the number zero had to be discovered. I didn't realize that it caused a revolution in philosophy and, and it just tore up math and it tore up. It builds modern society, but it, it wrecked everything in its way. It was an unbelievable disruptor and it was so difficult for society to get their heads around it. Yeah. And so zero is of course the representation of a zero principle thinking, which is it's the caliber and consequential nature of an idea. And so when you talk about what kind of ideas have civilization transforming properties, oftentimes they fall in the zero category. And so in thinking this through, I, I was wanting to find a quantitative structure on how to think about these zero principles. And that's, so I came up with that to be a coupler with first principles thinking. And so now it's a staple as part of how I think about the world and the future. So it emphasizes trying to identify the lens on that word impossible, like what is impossible, essentially trying to identify what is impossible and what is possible and being as how do you, I mean, this, this is the thing is most of society tells you the range of things they say is impossible is very wide. So you need to be shrinking that. I mean, that's the whole process of, of this kind of thinking is you need to be very rigorous in, in trying to be trying to draw the lines of what is actually impossible because very few things are actually impossible. I don't know what is actually impossible. Like it's the Joe Rogan is entirely possible. I like that approach to, to science, to engineering, to entrepreneurship. It's entirely possible. Basically shrink the impossible to zero to very small set. Life constraints favor first principles thinking because it, it enables faster action with higher probability of success. Pursuing zero with principle optionality is expensive and uncertain. And so in a society constrained by resources, time and money and a desire for social status, accomplishment, et cetera, it minimizes zero principle thinking. But the reason why I think zero principle thinking should be a staple of our shared cognitive infrastructure is if you look through the history of past couple thousand years and let's just say we arbitrarily, we subjectively try to assess what is a zero level, zero level idea and we say how many have occurred on what time scales and what were the contextual settings for it? I would argue that if you look at AlphaGo when it played go from another dimension with the, the human go players, when it saw AlphaGo's moves, it attributed it to like playing with an alien, playing go with, with AlphaGo being from another dimension. And so if you say computational intelligence has an attribute of introducing zero like insights, then if you say what is going to be the occurrence of zeros in society going forward, and you could reasonably say probably a lot more than have occurred and probably more at a faster pace. So then if you say what happens if you have this computational intelligence throughout society that manufacturing design and distribution of intelligence is now going to heading towards zero, you have an increased number of zeros being produced with a tight connection between human and computers. That's when I got to a point and said we cannot predict the future with first principles thinking. We can't, that cannot be our imagination set. It can't be our sole anchor in this situation that basically the future of our conscious existence 20, 30, 40, 50 years is probably a zero. Just to clarify, when you say zero, you're referring to basically a truly revolutionary idea. Yet something that is currently not a building block of our shared conscious existence, either in the form of knowledge. Yeah, it's currently not manifest in what we acknowledge. I suppose zero principles thinking is playing with ideas that are so revolutionary that we can't even clearly reason about the consequences once those ideas come to be. Or for example, like Einstein, that was a zero, I would categorize it as a zero principle insight. You mean general relativity, space time. Basically, building upon what Newton had done and said yes, also, and it just changed the fabric of our understanding of reality. That was unexpected. It existed. It became part of our awareness. The moves AlphaGo made existed. It just came into our awareness. To your point, there's this question of what do we know and what don't we know? Do we think we know 99% of all things or do we think we know 0.001% of all things? That goes back to known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. First principles and zero principle thinking gives us a quantitative framework to say there's no way for us to mathematically try to create probabilities for these things. Therefore, it would be helpful if they were just part of our standard thought processes because it may encourage different behaviors in what we do individually, collectively as a society, what we aspire to, what we talk about, the possibility sets we imagine. Yeah, I've been engaged in that kind of thinking quite a bit. In thinking about engineering of consciousness, I think it's feasible. I think it's possible in the language that we're using here. It's very difficult to reason about a world when inklings of consciousness can be engineered into artificial systems. Not from a philosophical perspective, but from an engineering perspective, I believe a good step towards engineering consciousness is creating engineering the illusion of consciousness. I'm captivated by our natural predisposition to anthropomorphize things. I don't want to hear from the philosophers, but I think that's what we kind of do to each other. Okay. Consciousness is created socially, that much of the power of consciousness is in the social interaction. I create your consciousness. No, I create my consciousness by having interacted with you. That's the display of consciousness. It's the same as the display of emotion. Emotion is created through communication. We're just created through its use. We somehow, humans, especially philosophers, the hard problem of consciousness, really want to believe that we possess this thing. There's an elf sitting there with a hat or nametag that says consciousness, and they're feeding this subjective experience to us, as opposed to it actually being an illusion that we construct to make social communication more effective. I think if you focus on creating the illusion of consciousness, you can create some very fulfilling experiences in software. That to me is a compelling space of ideas to explore. I agree with you. I think going back to our experience together with Brain Interface is on, you could imagine if we get to a certain level of maturity. First let's take the inverse of this. You and I text back and forth, and we're sending each other emojis. That has a certain amount of information transfer rate as we're communicating with each other. In our communication with people via email and text and whatnot, we've taken the bandwidth of human interaction, the information transfer rate, and we've reduced it. We have less social cues. We have less information to work with. There's a lot more opportunity for misunderstanding. That is altering the conscious experience between two individuals. If we add Brain Interface to the equation, let's imagine now we amplify the dimensionality of our communications. That to me is what you're talking about, which is consciousness engineering. Perhaps I understand you with dimensions. Maybe I understand when you look at the cup and you experience that happiness, you can tell me you're happy. I then do theory of mine and say, I can imagine what it might be like to be Lex and feel happy about seeing this cup. But if the interface could then quantify and give me a 50-vector space model and say, this is the version of happiness that Lex is experiencing as he looks at this cup, then it would allow me potentially to have much greater empathy for you and understand you as a human. This is how you experience joy, which is entirely unique from how I experience joy, even though we assumed ahead of time that we were having some kind of similar experience. But I agree with you that we do consciousness engineering today in everything we do. When we talk to each other, when we're building products, and that we're entering into a stage where it will be much more methodical and quantitative-based and computational in how we go about doing it. Which to me, I find encouraging because I think it creates better guardrails to create ethical systems versus right now, I feel like it's really a wild, wild west on how these interactions are happening. Yeah. And it's funny you focus on human to human, but that this kind of data enables human to machine interaction, which is what we're kind of talking about when we say engineering consciousness. And that will happen, of course. Let's flip that on its head. Right now, we're putting humans as the central node. What if we gave GPT-3 a bunch of human brains and said, Hey, GPT-3, learn some manners when you speak and run your algorithms on humans' brains and see how they respond. So you can be polite and so that you can be friendly and so that you can be conversationally appropriate. But to inverse it, to give our machines a training set in real time with closed loop feedback so that our machines were better equipped to find their way through our society in polite and kind and appropriate ways. I love that idea. Or better yet, teach it some, have it read the founding documents and have it visit Austin and Texas. And so that when you ask, when you tell it, why don't you learn some manners, GPT-3 learns to say no. It learns what it means to be free and a sovereign individual. So it depends what kind of version of GPT-3 you want. One that's free, one that behaves well with the social revolution. You want a socialist GPT-3, you want an anarchist GPT-3, you want to polite, like you take it home to visit mom and dad, GPT-3 and you want like party and like Vegas to a strip club GPT-3, you want all flavors. And then you've got to have goal alignment between all those. Yeah, they don't want to manipulate each other for sure. You kind of spoke to ethics. One of the concerns that people have in this modern world, the digital data is that of privacy and security, but privacy, they're concerned that when they share data, it's the same thing with you when we trust other human beings in being fragile and revealing something that we're vulnerable about. There's a leap of faith, there's a leap of trust that that's going to be just between us as a privacy to it. And then the challenge is when you're in the digital space, then sharing your data with companies that use that data for advertisement and all those kinds of things, there's a hesitancy to share that much data, to share a lot of deep personal data. And if you look at brain data, that feels a whole lot like it's richly, deeply personal data. So how do you think about privacy with this kind of ocean of data? I think we got off to a wrong start with the internet where the basic rules of play for the company that be was if you're a company, you can go out and get as much information on a person as you can find without their approval. And you can also do things to induce them to give you as much information. And you don't need to tell them what you're doing with it. You can do anything on the backside, you can make money on it, but the game is who can acquire the most information and devise the most clever schemes to do it. That was a bad starting place. And so we are in this period where we need to correct for that. And we need to say, first of all, the individual always has control over their data. It's not a free for all. It's not like a game of hungry hippo. They can just go out and grab as much as they want. So for example, when your brain data was recorded today, the first thing we did in the kernel app was you have control over your data. And so it's individual consent, it's individual control. And then you can build up on top of that. But it has to be based upon some clear rules of play of everyone knows what's being collected. They know what's being done with it. And the person has control over it. The transparency and control. So everybody knows what does control look like? My ability to delete the data if I want. Yeah, delete it and to know who it's being shared with under what terms and conditions. We haven't reached that level of sophistication with our products. If you say, for example, hey, Spotify, please give me a customized playlist according to my neurome, you could say you can have access to this vector space model, but only for this duration of time. And then you've got to delete it. We haven't gotten there to that level of sophistication. But these are ideas we need to start talking about of how would you actually structure permissions? Yeah. And I think it creates a much more stable set for society to build where we understand the rules of play and people aren't vulnerable to being taken advantage. It's not fair for an individual to be taken advantage of without their awareness with some other practice that some company is doing for their sole benefit. And so hopefully we are going through a process now where we're correcting for these things and that it can be an economy wide shift that because really these are fundamentals we need to have in place. It's kind of fun to think about like in Chrome when you install an extension or like install an app, it's ask you like what permissions you're willing to give and be cool if in the future it says like you can have access to my brain data. I mean it's not unimaginable in the future that the big technology companies have built a business based upon acquiring data about you that they can then create a model of you and sell that predictability. And so it's not unimaginable that you will create with like kernel device, for example, a more reliable predictor of you than they could and that they're asking you for permission to complete their objectives and you're the one that gets to negotiate that with them and say sure. But so it's not unimaginable that might be the case. So there's a guy named D.Lan Musk and he has a company, one of the many companies called Neuralink that's also excited about the brain. So it'd be interesting to hear your kind of opinions about a very different approach that's invasive that requires surgery, that implants a data collection device in the brain. How do you think about the difference between kernel and Neuralink in the approaches of getting that stream of brain data? Elon and I spoke about this a lot early on. We met up, I had started kernel and he had an interest in brain interfaces as well and we explored doing something together, him joining kernel and ultimately it wasn't the right move and so he started Neuralink and I continued building kernel. But it was interesting because we were both at this very early time where it wasn't certain what if there was a path to pursue, if now was the right time to do something and then the technological choice of doing that. And so we were both, our starting point was looking at invasive technologies and I was building invasive technology at the time. That's ultimately where he's gone. Until less than a year after Elon and I were engaged, I shifted kernel to do non-invasive. And we had this neuroscientist come to kernel we were talking about. He had been doing a neural surgery for 30 years, one of the most respected neuroscientists in the US and we brought him to kernel to figure out the ins and outs of his profession. And at the very end of our three hour conversation, he said, you know, every 15 or so years a new technology comes along that changes everything. He said, it's probably already here. You just can't see it yet. And my jaw dropped. I thought, because I had spoken to Bob Greenberg who had built a second site first on the optical nerve and then he did an array on the optical cortex. And then I also became friendly with NeuroPace who does the implants for seizure detection and remediation. And I saw in their eyes what it was like to take something through an implantable device through for a 15 year run. They initially thought it was seven years and it ended up being 15 years and they thought it'd be a hundred million, 300 or 400 million. And I really didn't want to build invasive technology. It was the only thing that appeared to be possible. But then once I spun up an internal effort to start looking at non-invasive options, we said, is there something here? Is there anything here that again has the characteristics of it has the high quality data, it could be low cost, it could be accessible. Could it make brain interfaces mainstream? And so I did a bet the company move. We shifted from non-invasive to invasive to non-invasive. So the answer is yes to that. There's something there that's possible. The answer is we'll see. We've now built both technologies and they're now you experienced one of them today. We were applying, we're now deploying it. So we're trying to figure out what value is really there. But I'd say it's really too early to express confidence whether it's too, I think it's too early to assess which technological choice is the right one on what time scales. Yeah. Time scales are really important here. Very important. Because if you look at the like on the invasive side, there's so much activity going on right now of less invasive techniques to get at the neuron firings, which what Neuralink is building it's possible that in 10, 15 years when they're scaling that technology, other things have come along and you'd much rather do that. That thing starts to clock again. It may not be the case. It may be the case that Neuralink has properly chosen the right technology and that that's exactly what they want to be. Totally possible. It's possible that the path we chose are non-invasive fall short for a variety of reasons. It's unknown. And so right now the two technologies we chose, the analogy I'd give you to create a baseline of understanding is if you think of it like the internet in the 90s, the internet became useful when people could do a dial-up connection and then as bandwidth increased, so did the utility of that connection and so did the ecosystem improve. And so if you say what kernel flow is going to give you a full screen on the picture of information, but as you're going to be watching a movie, but the image is going to be blurred and the audio is going to be muffled. So it has a lower resolution of coverage. Kernel Flux, our MEG technology is going to give you the full movie in 1080p and Neuralink is going to give you a circle on the screen of 4K. And so each one has their pros and cons and it's give and take. And so the decision I made with Kernel was that these two technologies, Flux and Flow, were basically the answer for the next seven years. And they would give rise to the ecosystem, which would become much more valuable than the hardware itself and that we would just continue to improve on the hardware over time. And it's early days. So it's kind of fascinating to think about that. It's very true that you don't know both paths are promising. And it's like 50 years from now, we will look back and maybe not even remember one of them and the other one might change the world. It's so cool how technology is. I mean, that's what entrepreneurship is. It's the principle is like you're marching ahead into the darkness, into the fog, not knowing. It's wonderful to have someone else out there with us doing this, because if you look at brain interfaces, anything that's off the shelf right now is inadequate. It's had its run for a couple of decades. It's still in hacker communities. It hasn't gone to the mainstream. The room size machines are on their own path, but there is no answer right now of bringing brain interfaces mainstream. And so both they and us, we've both spent over a hundred million dollars. And that's kind of what it takes to have a go at this because you need to build full stack. I mean, at Kernel, we are from the photon and the atom through the machine learning. We have just under a hundred people. I think it's something like 36, 37 PhDs in these specialties, these areas that there's only a few people in the world who have these abilities. And that's what it takes to build next generation, to make an attempt at breaking into brain interfaces. And so we'll see over the next couple of years, whether it's the right time or whether we are both too early or whether something else comes along in seven to 10 years, which is the right thing that brings it mainstream. So you see Elon as the kind of competitor or a fellow traveler along the path of uncertainty or both. It's a fellow traveler. It's like at the beginning of the internet is how many companies are going to be invited to this new ecosystem. Like an endless number. Because if you think that the hardware just starts the process and so, okay, back to your initial example, if you take the Fitbit, for example, you say, okay, now I can get measurements on the body. And what do we think the ultimate value of this device is going to be? What is the information transfer rate? And they were in the market for a certain duration of time and Google bought them for $2.5 billion. They didn't have ancillary value add. There weren't people building on top of the Fitbit device. They also didn't have increased insight with additional data streams. So it's really just the device. If you look, for example, at Apple and the device they sell, you have value in the device that someone buys, but also you have everyone who's building on top of it. So you have this additional ecosystem value and then you have additional data streams that come in which increase the value of the product. And so if you look at the hardware as the instigator of value creation, over time, what we've built may constitute 5% or 10% of the value of the overall ecosystem. And that's what we really care about. What we're trying to do is kickstart the mainstream adoption of quantifying the brain. And the hardware just opens the door to say what kind of ecosystem could exist. And that's why the examples are so relevant of the things you've outlined in your life. I hope those things, the books people write, the experiences people build, the conversations you have, your relationship with your AI systems, I hope those all are feeding on the insights built upon this ecosystem we've created to better your life. And so that's the thinking behind it. Again, with the Drake equation being the underlying driver of value. And the people at Kernel have joined not because we have certainty of success, but because we find it to be the most exhilarating opportunity we could ever pursue in this time to be alive. You founded the payment system Braintree in 2007 that acquired Venmo in 2012. In that same year was acquired by PayPal, which is now eBay. Can you tell me the story of the vision and the challenge of building an online payment system and just building a large successful business in general? I discovered payments by accident. When I was 21, I just returned from Ecuador, living among extreme poverty for two years. And I came back to the US and I was shocked by the opulence of the United States. And I just thought, I couldn't believe it. And I decided I wanted to try to spend my life helping others. That was the life objective that I thought was worthwhile to pursue versus making money and whatever the case may be for its own right. And so I decided in that moment that I was going to try to make enough money by the age of 30 to never have to work again. And then with some abundance of money, I could then choose to do things that might be beneficial to others, but may not meet the criteria of being a standalone business. And so in that process, I started a few companies, had some small successes, had some failures. In one of the endeavors, I was up to my eyeballs in debt. Things were not going well and I needed a part-time job to pay my bills. And so one day I saw in the paper in Utah where I was living, the 50 richest people in Utah, and I emailed each one of their assistants and said, I'm young, I'm resourceful, I'll do anything, I'm entrepreneurial. I tried to get a job that would be flexible and no one responded. And then I interviewed at a few dozen places. Nobody would even give me the time of day. It wouldn't want to take me seriously. And so finally, it was on monster.com that I saw this job posting for credit card sales door to door. I did not know this story. This is great. I love the head drop. That's exactly right. So it was the low points to which we go in life. So I responded and the person made an attempt at suggesting that they had some kind of standards that they would consider hiring. But it's kind of like, if you could fog a mirror, come and do this because it's a hundred percent commission. And so I started walking up and down the street in my community selling credit card processing. And so what you learn immediately in doing that is if you walk into a business, first of all, the business owner is typically there and you walk in the door and they can tell by how you're dressed or how you walk, whatever their pattern recognition is. And they just hate you immediately. It's like, stop wasting my time. I really am trying to get stuff done. I don't want to listen to a sales pitch. And so you have to overcome the initial get out. And then once you engage, when you say the word credit card processing, the person's like, I already hate you because I have been taken advantage of dozens of times because you all are weasels. And so I had to figure out an algorithm to get past all those different conditions because I was still working on my other startup for the majority of my time. I was doing this part time. And so I figured out that the industry really was built on people, on deceit, basically people promising things that were not reality. So I'd walk into a business and I'd say, look, I would give you a hundred dollars. I'd put a hundred dollar bill and say, I'll give you a hundred dollars for three minutes of your time. If you don't say yes to what I'm saying, I'll give you a hundred dollars. And then he'd usually crack a smile and say, okay, what do you got for me, son? And so I'd sit down and I just opened my book and I'd say, here's the credit card industry. Here's how it works. Here are the players. Here's what they do. Here's how they deceive you. Here's what I am. I'm no different than anyone else. It's like, you're going to process your credit card. You're going to get the money in the account. You're just going to get a clean statement. You're going to have someone who answers the call when someone asks and you know, just like the basic, like you're okay. And people started saying yes. And then of course I went to the next business and be like, you know, Joe and Susie and whoever said yes to, and so I built a social proof structure and I became the number one salesperson out of 400 people nationwide doing this. And I worked, you know, half time still doing this other startup. And that's a brilliant strategy, by the way. It's very well, very well strategized and executed. They did it for nine months. And at the time my customer base was making, was generating around, I think it was six, if I remember correctly, $62,504 a month were the overall revenues. I thought, wow, that's amazing. If I built that as my own company, I would just make $62,000 a month of income passively with these merchants processing credit cards. So I thought, hmm. And so that's when I thought I'm going to create a company. And so then I started Braintree and the idea was the online world was broken because PayPal had been acquired by eBay around, I think 1999 or 2000. And eBay had not innovated much with PayPal. So it basically sat still for seven years as the software world moved along. And then Authorize.net was also a company that was relatively stagnant. So you basically had software engineers who wanted modern payment tools, but there were none available for them. And so they just dealt with software they didn't like. And so with Braintree, I thought the entry point is to build software that engineers will love. And if we can find the entry point via software and make it easy and beautiful and just a magical experience and then provide customer service on top of that, that would be great. What I was really going after though, it was PayPal. They were the only company in payments making money because they had the relationship with eBay early on. People created a PayPal account. They had fund their account with their checking account versus their credit cards. And then when they'd use PayPal to pay a merchant, PayPal had a cost of payment of zero versus if you have coming from a credit card, you have to pay the bank the fees. So PayPal's margins were 3% on a transaction versus a typical payments company, which may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or something like that. And so I knew PayPal really was the model to replicate, but a bunch of companies had tried to do that. They tried to come in and build a two-sided marketplace. So get consumers to fund the checking account and the merchants to accept it. But they'd all failed because building a two-sided marketplace is very hard at the same time. So my plan was I'm going to build a company and get the best merchants in the whole world to use our service. Then in year five, I'm going to acquire a consumer payments company and I'm going to bring the two together. And so focus on the merchant side and then get the payments company that does the customer, the whatever. So the other side of it. Yeah. This is the plan I presented when I was at the University of Chicago. And weirdly, it happened exactly like that. So four years in, our customer base included Uber, Airbnb, GitHub, 37Signals, not Basecamp. We had a fantastic collection of companies that represented some of the fastest growing tech companies in the world. And then we met up with Venmo and they had done a remarkable job in building product. Then something very counterintuitive, which is make public your private financial transactions, which people previously thought were something that should be hidden from others. And we acquired Venmo. And at that point, we replicated the model because now people could fund their Venmo account with their checking account, keep money in the account, and then you could just plug Venmo in as a form of payment. And so I think PayPal saw that, that we were getting the best merchants in the world. We had people using Venmo. They were both the up and coming millennials at the time who had so much influence online. And so they came in and offered us an attractive number. And my goal was not to build the biggest payments company in the world. It wasn't to try to climb the Forbes billionaire list. The objective was I want to earn enough money so that I can basically dedicate my attention to doing something that could potentially be useful on a society-wide scale. And more importantly, that could be considered to be valuable from the vantage point of 2050, 2100, and 2500. So thinking about it on a few hundred year timescale. And there was a certain amount of money I needed to do that. So I didn't require the permission of anybody to do that. And so what PayPal offered was sufficient for me to get that amount of money to basically have a go. And that's when I set off to survey everything I could identify in existence to say of anything in the entire world I could do, what one thing could I do that would actually have the highest value potential for the species? And so it took me a little while to arrive at Brain Interfaces. You know, payments in themselves are revolutionary technologies that can change the world. Let's not forget that too easily. I mean, obviously, you know this, but there's quite a few lovely folks who are now fascinated with the space of cryptocurrency. And payments are very much connected to this, but in general, just money. And many of the folks I've spoken with, they also kind of connect that to not just purely financial discussions, but philosophical and political discussions. And they see Bitcoin as a way, almost as activism, almost as a way to resist the corruption of centralized centers of power. And sort of basically in the 21st century, decentralizing control, whether that's Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, they see that's one possible way to give power to those that live in regimes that are corrupt or are not respectful of human rights and all those kinds of things. What's your sense, just all your expertise with payments and seeing how that changed the world, what's your sense about the lay of the land for the future of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies in the positive impact they may have on the world? To be clear, my communication wasn't meant to minimize payments or to denigrate it in any way. It was an attempt at communication that when I was surveying the world, it was an algorithm of what could I individually do? So there are things that exist that have a lot of potential that can be done. And then there's a filtering of how many people are qualified to do this given thing. And then there's a further characterization that can be done of, okay, given the number of qualified people, will somebody be a unique out performer of that group to make something truly impossible to be something done that otherwise couldn't get done? So there's a process of assessing where can you add unique value in the world. And some of that has to do with you being very formal and calculative here, but some of that is just like what do you sense? Part of that equation is how much passion you sense within yourself to be able to drive that through, to discover the possibilities and make them possible. That's right. And so we were a brain tree. I think we were the first company to integrate Coinbase into our... I think we were the first payments company to formally incorporate crypto, if I'm not mistaken. For people not familiar, Coinbase is a place where you can trade cryptocurrencies. Yeah, which was one of the only places you could. So we were early in doing that. And of course, this was in the year 2013, so an attorney to go in cryptocurrency land. I concur with the statement you made of the potential of the principles underlying cryptocurrencies and that many of the things that they're building in the name of money and of moving value is equally applicable to the brain and equally applicable to how the brain interacts with the rest of the world and how we would imagine doing goal alignment with people. So to me, it's a continuous spectrum of possibility. Your question is isolated on the money and I think it just is basically a scaffolding layer for all of society. So you don't see this money as particularly distinct from... I don't. I think we at Kernel, we will benefit greatly from the progress being made in cryptocurrency because it will be a similar technology stack we will want to use for many things we want to accomplish. And so I'm bullish on what's going on and think it could greatly enhance brain interfaces and the value of the brain interface ecosystem. Is there something you could say about, first of all, bullish on cryptocurrency versus fiat money? Do you have a sense that in 21st century, cryptocurrency will be embraced by governments and changed the face of governments, the structure of governments? It's the same way I think about my diet, where previously it was conscious Brian looking at foods in certain biochemical states. Am I hungry, am I irritated, am I depressed, and then I choose based upon those momentary windows. Do I eat at night when I'm fatigued and I have low willpower? Am I going to pig out on something? And the current monetary system is based upon human conscious decision making and politics and power and this whole mess of things. And what I like about the building blocks of cryptocurrencies, it's methodical, it's structured. It is accountable. It's transparent. So it introduces this scaffolding, which I think again is the right starting point for how we think about building next generation institutions for society. And that's why I think it's much broader than money. So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin is the demotion of the conscious mind as well. In the same way you were talking about diet, it's like giving less priority to the ups and downs of any one particular human mind, in this case your own, and giving more power to the sort of data driven. Yes. Yeah. I think that is accurate that cryptocurrency is a version of what I would call my autonomous self that I'm trying to build. It is an introduction of an autonomous system of value exchange and the process of value creation in society. Yes. I see there are similarities. So I guess what you're saying is Bitcoin will somehow help me not pig out at night or the equivalent of speaking of diet, if we could just linger on that topic a little bit. We already talked about your blog post of I fired myself, I fired Brian the evening, Brian who was too willing to not making good decisions for the long-term wellbeing and happiness of the entirety of the organism. Basically you were like pigging out at night. But it's interesting because I do the same, in fact I often eat one meal a day and I have been this week actually, especially when I travel. It's funny that it never occurred to me to just basically look at the fact that I'm able to be much smarter about my eating decisions in the morning and the afternoon than I am at night. So if I eat one meal a day, why not eat that one meal a day in the morning? It never occurred to me, this revolution, until you've outlined that. So maybe can you give some details and this is just you, this is one person, Brian arrives at a particular thing that they do, but it's fascinating to kind of look at this one particular case study. So what works for you diet-wise? What's your actual diet? What do you eat? How often do you eat? My current protocol is basically the result of thousands of experiments and decision making. So I do this every 90 days, I do the tests, I do the cycle throughs, then I measure again and then I'm measuring all the time. So what I, of course, I'm optimizing for my biomarkers. I want perfect cholesterol and I want perfect blood glucose levels and perfect DNA methylation processes. I also want perfect sleep. And so for example, recently, the past two weeks, my resting heart rate has been at 42 when I sleep. And when my resting heart rate is at 42, my HRV is at its highest and I wake up in the morning feeling more energized than any other configuration. And so I know from all these processes that eating at roughly 830 in the morning, right after I work out on an empty stomach, creates enough distance between that completed eating and bedtime where I have no almost no digestion processes going on in my body. Therefore my resting heart rate goes very low. And when my resting heart rate is very low, I sleep with high quality. And so basically I've been trying to optimize the entirety of what I eat to my sleep quality. And my sleep quality then of course feeds into my willpower. So it creates this virtuous cycle. So at 830, what I do is I eat what I call super veggie, which is it's a pudding of 250 grams of broccoli, 150 grams of cauliflower and a whole bunch of other vegetables that I eat what I call nutty pudding, which is- You make the pudding yourself like a veggie mix, whatever thing. Like a blender. Yeah. You can be made in a high speed blender. But basically I eat the same thing every day, veggie bowl as in a form of pudding and then a bowl in the form of nuts. And then I have- So vegan. Vegan, yes. Vegan. So that's fat and that's like that's fat and carbs and some protein and so on. Does it taste good? I love it. I love it so much. I dream about it. Yeah. That's awesome. And then I have a third dish, which is, it changes every day. Today it was kale and spinach and sweet potato. And then I take about 20 supplements that hopefully constitute a perfect nutritional profile. So what I'm trying to do is create the perfect diet for my body every single day. Where sleep is part of the optimization. That's right. You're like one of the things you're really tracking. I mean, can you, well, I have a million questions, but 20 supplements, like what kind are like, would you say are essential? Cause I only take, I only take athleticgreens.com slash what? That's like the multivitamin essentially. That's like the lazy man. You know, like if you don't actually want to think about shit, that's what you take. And then fish oil and that's it. That's all I take. Yeah. And then the good North Whitehead said, civilization advances as it extends the number of important operations it can do without thinking about them. Yes. And so my objective on this is I want an algorithm for perfect health that I never have to think about. And then I want that system to be scalable to anybody so that they don't have to think about it. And right now it's expensive for me to do it. It's time consuming for me to do it. And I have infrastructure to do it, but the future of being human is not going to the grocery store and deciding what to eat. It's also not reading scientific papers, trying to decide this thing or that thing. It's all end of one. So it's devices on the outside and inside your body, assessing real time what your body needs and then creating closed loop systems for that to happen. Yeah. So right now you're doing the data collection and you're being the scientist. It'd be much better if you just did the data collection or it was being essentially done for you and you can outsource that to another scientist that's doing the end of one study of you. That's right. Because every time I spend time thinking about this or executing, spending time on it, I'm spending less time thinking about building kernel or the future of being human. And so we just all have the budget of our capacity on an everyday basis and we will scaffold our way up out of this. And so yeah, hopefully what I'm doing is really, it serves as a model that others can also build. That's why I wrote about it is hopefully people can then take it and improve upon it. I hold nothing sacred. I change my diet almost every day based upon some new test results or science or something like that. But can you maybe elaborate on the sleep thing? Why is sleep so important and why I presumably like, what does good sleep mean to you? I think sleep is a contender for being the most powerful health intervention in existence. It's a contender. I mean, it's magical what it does if you're well rested and what your body can do. And I mean, for example, I know when I eat close to my bedtime and I've done a systematic study for years looking at like 15 minute increments on time of day and where I eat my last meal, my willpower is directly correlated to the amount of deep sleep I get. So my ability to not binge eat at night when Rascal Bryan's out and about is based upon how much deep sleep I got the night before. And so there's a lot to that. And so I've seen it manifest itself and so I think the way I summarize this is in society, we've had this myth of we tell stories, for example, of entrepreneurship where this person was so amazing, they stayed at the office for three days and slept under their desk. And we say, wow, that's amazing. That's amazing. And now I think we're headed towards a state where we'd say that's primitive and really not a good idea on every level. And so the new mythology is going to be the exact opposite. Yeah, by the way, just to sort of maybe push back a little bit on that idea. Did you sleep under your desk, Alex? Well, yeah, a lot. I'm a big believer in that actually. I'm a big believer in chaos and not giving like giving into your passion and sometimes doing things that are out of the ordinary, they're like not trying to optimize health for certain periods of time in lieu of your passions is a signal to yourself that you're throwing everything away. So I think what you're referring to is how to have good performance for prolonged periods of time. I think there's moments in life when you need to throw all of that away. All the plans away, all the structure away. So I'm not sure I have an eloquent way of describing exactly what I'm talking about, but it all depends on different people. People are different, but there's a danger of over optimization to where you don't just give in to the madness of the way your brain flows. I mean, to push back on my pushback is like it's nice to have like where the foundations of your brain are not messed with. So you have a fixed foundation where the diet is fixed, where the sleep is fixed, and that all that is optimal. And the chaos happens in the space of ideas as opposed to the space of biology. But I'm not sure if there's a... That requires real discipline and forming habits. There's some aspect to which some of the best days and weeks of my life have been, yeah, sleeping under a desk kind of thing. And I'm not too willing to let go of things that empirically worked for things that work in theory. So again, I'm absolutely with you on sleep. Also I'm with you on sleep conceptually, but I'm also very humbled to understand that for different people, good sleep means different things. I'm very hesitant to trust science on sleep. I think you should also be a scholar of your own body. Again, the experiment of N of one. I'm not so sure that a full night's sleep is great for me. There is something about that power nap that I just have not fully studied yet, but that nap is something special that I'm not sure I found the optimal thing. So there's a lot to be explored to what is exactly optimal amount of sleep, optimal kind of sleep combined with diet and all those kinds of... That all maps to sort of data, at least the truth, exactly what you're referring to. Here's a data point for your consideration. The progress in biology over the past, say decade, has been stunning. And it now appears as if we will be able to replace our organs, X-ray transplantation. And so we probably have a path to replace and regenerate every organ of your body, except for your brain. You can lose your hand and your arm and a leg, you can have an artificial heart. You can't operate without your brain. And so when you make that trade-off decision of whether you're going to sleep under the desk or not and go all out for a four-day marathon, there's a cost-benefit trade-off of what's happening to your brain in that situation. We don't know the consequences of modern day life on our brain. It's the most valuable organ in our existence. And we don't know what's going on in how we're treating it today with stress and with sleep and with dietary. And to me, then if you say that you're trying to optimize life for whatever things you're trying to do, with the progress in anti-aging and biology, the game is very soon going to become different than what it is right now with organ rejuvenation, organ replacement. And I would conjecture that we will value the health status of our brain above all things. Yeah, no, absolutely. Everything you're saying is true, but we die. We die pretty quickly. Life is short. And I'm one of those people that I would rather die in battle than stay safe at home. It's like, yeah, you look at kind of, there's a lot of things that you can reasonably say this is the smart thing to do that can prevent you, that becomes conservative, that can prevent you from fully embracing life. I think ultimately you can be very intelligent and data-driven and also embrace life. But I err on the side of embracing life. It takes a very skillful person to not sort of that hovering parent that says, you know what? There's a 3% chance that if you go out by yourself and play, you're going to die, get run over by a car, come to a slow or a sudden end. And I am more a supporter of just go out there. If you die, you die. And that's a, it's a balance you have to strike. I think there's a balance to strike in long-term optimization and short-term freedom. For me, for a programmer, for a programming mind, I tend to over-optimize and I'm very cautious and afraid of that. To not over-optimize and thereby be overly cautious, suboptimally cautious about everything I do. And then the ultimate thing I'm trying to optimize for is funny you said like sleep and all those kinds of things. I tend to think this is a, you're being more precise than I am, but I think I tend to want to minimize stress, which everything comes into that from your sleep and all those kinds of things. But I worry that whenever I'm trying to be too strict with myself, then the stress goes up when I don't follow the strictness. And so you have to kind of, it's a weird, there's so many variables in an objective function that it's hard to get right. And sort of not giving a damn about sleep and not giving a damn about diet is a good thing to inject in there every once in a while for somebody who's trying to optimize everything. But that's me just trying to, like it's exactly like you said, you're just a scientist, I'm a scientist of myself, you're a scientist of yourself. It'd be nice if somebody else was doing it and had much better data than, because I don't trust my conscious mind and I pigged out last night at some brisket in LA that I regret deeply. There's no point to anything I just said. What is the nature of your regret on the brisket? Is it, do you wish you hadn't eaten it entirely? Is it that you wish you hadn't eaten as much as you did? Is it that? I think, well, the most regret, I mean, if we want to be specific, I drank way too much like diet soda. My biggest regret is like having drank so much diet soda. That's the thing that really was the problem. I had trouble sleeping because of that, because I was like programming and then I was editing. And so I stayed up late at night and then I had to get up to go pee a few times and it was just a mess. A mess of a night. Well, it's not really a mess, but it's like the little things. I know if I just eat, I drink a little bit of water and that's it. All of us have perfect days that we know diet wise and so on that's good to follow. You feel good. I know what it takes for me to do that. I didn't fully do that and thereby, because there's an avalanche effect where the other sources of stress, all the other to-do items I have pile on my failure to execute on some basic things that I know make me feel good and all of that combines to create a mess of a day. But some of that chaos, you have to be okay with it, but some of it I wish was a little bit more optimal. And your ideas about eating in the morning are quite interesting as an experiment to try. Can you elaborate? Are you eating once a day? Yes. In the morning and that's it. Can you maybe speak to how that... You spoke, it's funny, you spoke about the metrics of sleep, but you're also, you run a business, you're incredibly intelligent. Mostly your happiness and success relies on you thinking clearly. So how does that affect your mind and your body in terms of performance? So not just sleep, but actual mental performance. As you were explaining your objective function of, for example, in the criteria you were including, you like certain neurochemical states. You like feeling like you're living life, that life has enjoyment, that sometimes you want to disregard certain rules to have a moment of passion, of focus. There's this architecture of the way Lex is, which makes you happy as a story you tell, something you kind of experience. Maybe the experience is a bit more complicated, but in this idea you have, this is a version of you. And the reason why I maintain the schedule I do is I've chosen a game to say, I would like to live a life where I care more about what people who live in the year 2500 think of me than I do today. That's the game I'm trying to play. And so therefore, the only thing I really care about on this optimization is trying to see past myself, past my limitations, using zeroes principle thinking, pull myself out of this contextual mesh we're in right now and say, what will matter a hundred years from now and 200 years from now? What are the big things really going on that are defining reality? And I find that if I were to hang out with diet soda Lex and diet soda Brian were to play along with that and my deep sleep were to get crushed as a result, my mind would not be on what matters in a hundred years or 200 years or 300 years. I would be irritable. I would be in a different state. And so it's just gameplay selection. It's what you and I have chosen to think about. It's what we've chosen to work on. And this is why I'm saying that no generation of humans have ever been afforded the opportunity to look at their lifespan and contemplate that they will have the possibility of experiencing an evolved form of consciousness that is undeniable, that would fall in a zero category of potential. That to me is the most exciting thing in existence. And I would not trade any momentary neurochemical state right now in exchange for that. I would, I'd be willing to deprive myself of all momentary joy in the pursuit of that goal because that's what makes me happy. That's brilliant. But I'm a bit, I just looked it up. I just looked up Braveheart's speech and William Wallace, but I don't know if you've seen it. Fight and you may die, run and you'll live at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance, just one chance, picture Mel Gibson saying this, to come back here and tell our enemies that they may take our lives with growing excitement, but they'll never take our freedom. I get excited every time I see that in the movie, but that's kind of how I approach life. And do you think they were tracking their sleep? We're not tracking their sleep and they ate way too much brisket and they were fat, unhealthy, died early and were primitive. But there's something in my eight brain that's attracted to that, even though most of my life is fully aligned with the way you see yours. Part of it is for comedy, of course, but part of it is like, I'm almost afraid of over optimization. Really what you're saying though, if we're looking at this, let's say from a first principles perspective, when you read those words, they conjure up certain life experiences, but you're basically saying I experienced a certain neurotransmitter state when these things are in action. That's all you're saying. So whether it's that or something else, you're just saying you have a selection for how your state for your body. And so if you as an engineer of consciousness, that should just be engineerable. That's just triggering certain chemical reactions. So it doesn't mean they have to be mutually exclusive. You can have that and experience that and also not sacrifice long-term health. And I think that's the potential of where we're going is we don't have to assume they are trade-offs that must be had. Absolutely. So I guess from my particular brain, it's useful to have the outlier experiences that also come along with the illusion of free will where I chose those experiences that make me feel like it's freedom. Listen, going to Texas made me realize, I spent, so I was, I still am, but I lived at Cambridge at MIT and I never felt like home there. I felt like home in the space of ideas with the colleagues, like when I was actually discussing ideas, but there is something about the constraints, how cautious people are, how much they valued also kind of material success, career success. When I showed up to Texas, it felt like I belong. That was very interesting, but that's my neurochemistry, whatever the hell that is, whatever, whatever, maybe probably is rooted to the fact that I grew up in the Soviet Union. It was so such a constrained system that you'd really deeply value freedom. You always want to escape the man and the control of centralized systems. I don't know what it is, but that's, but at the same time, I love strictness. I love the dogmatic authoritarianism of diet, of like the same habit, exactly the habit you have. I think that's actually when bodies perform optimally, my body performs optimally. So balancing those two, I think if I have the data, every once in a while, party with some wild people, but most of the time, eat once a day, perhaps in the morning, I'm going to try that. That might be very interesting, but I'd rather not try it. I'd rather have the data that tells me to do it. But in general, you're able to eating once a day, think deeply about stuff like this. Concern that people have is like, does your energy wane, all those kinds of things. Do you find that it's, especially because it's unique, it's vegan as well. So you find that you're able to have a clear mind, a focus and just physically and mentally throughout. Yeah. I find like my personal experience in thinking about hard things is like, oftentimes I feel like I'm looking through a telescope and I come aligning two or three telescopes and you kind of have to close one eye and move it back and forth a little bit and just find just the right alignment. Then you find just a sneak peek at the thing you're trying to find, but it's fleeting. If you move just one little bit, it's gone. And oftentimes what I feel like are the ideas I value the most are like that. They're so fragile and fleeting and slippery and elusive and it requires a sensitivity to thinking and a sensitivity to maneuver through these things. If I concede to a world where I'm on my phone texting, I'm also on social media. I'm also doing 15 things at the same time because I'm running a company and I'm also feeling terrible from the last night. It all just comes crashing down and the quality of my thoughts goes to a zero. I'm a functional person to respond to basic level things, but I don't feel like I'm doing anything interesting. I think that's a good word, sensitivity, because that's what thinking deeply feels like is you're sensitive to the fragile thoughts and you're right. All those other distractions kind of dull your ability to be sensitive to the fragile thoughts. It's a really good word. Out of all the things you've done, you've also climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. Is this true? It's true. What do you, why and how and what do you take from that experience? I guess the backstory is relevant because in that moment, it was the darkest time of my life. I was ending a 13 year marriage. I was leaving my religion. I sold Braintree and I was coming a battling depression where I was just at the end. I got invited to go to Tanzania as part of a group that was raising money to build clean water wells. I had made some money from Braintree and so I was able to donate $25,000. It was the first time I had ever had money to donate outside of paying tithing in my religion. It was such a phenomenal experience to contribute something meaningful to someone else in that form. As part of this process, we were going to climb the mountain. We went there and we saw the clean water wells we were building. We spoke to the people there and it was very energizing. When we climbed Kilimanjaro, I came down with a stomach flu on day three and I also had altitude sickness. But I became so sick that on day four, we were summiting on day five, I came into the camp, base camp at 15,000 feet, just going to the bathroom on myself and falling all over. I was just a disaster. I was so sick. Stomach flu and altitude sickness. Yeah, and I just was destroyed from the situation. Plus psychologically, one of the lowest points you've ever had. Yeah, and I think that was probably a big contributor. I was just smoked as a human, just absolutely done. I had three young children and so I was trying to reconcile. Whether I live or not is not my decision by itself. I'm now intertwined with these three little people and I have an obligation whether I like it or not, I need to be there. And so it did, it felt like I was just stuck in a straight jacket. And I had to decide whether I was going to summit the next day with the team. And it was a difficult decision because once you start hiking, there's no way to get off the mountain. And midnight came and our guide came in and he said, where are you at? And I said, I think I'm okay. I think I can try. And so we went. And so from midnight to, I made it to the summit at 5 a.m. It was one of the most transformational moments of my existence. And the mountain became my problem. It became everything that I was struggling with. And when I started hiking, the pain got so ferocious that it became so ferocious that I turned my music to Eminem. And Eminem was the only person in existence that spoke to my soul. And it was something about his anger and his vibrancy and his multibentrality. He's the only person who I could turn on and I could say, I feel some relief. I turned on Eminem and I made it to the summit after five hours. But just 100 yards from the top, I was with my guide Ike and I started getting very dizzy and I felt like I was going to fall backwards off this cliff area we were on. I was like, this is dangerous. And he said, look, Brian, I know where you're at. I know where you're at. And I can tell you, you've got it in you. So I want you to look up, take a step, take a breath and look up, take a breath and take a step. And I did. And I made it. And so I got there and I just sat down with him at the top. I just cried like a baby. Broke down. I just lost it. And so he let me do my thing and then we pulled out the pulse oximeter and he measured my blood oxygen levels and it was like 50 something percent. And it was danger zone. So he looked at it and I think he was like really alarmed that I was in this situation. And so he said, we can't get a helicopter here and we can't get you emergency evacuated. You've got to go down. You've got to hike down to 15,000 feet to get base camp. And so we went down the mountain. I got back down to base camp. And again, that was pretty difficult. And then they put me on a stretcher, this metal stretcher with this one wheel and a team of six people wheeled me down the mountain. And it was pretty torturous. I'm very appreciative they did. Also the trail is very bumpy. So they'd go over these big rocks. And so my head would just slam against this metal thing for hours. And so I just felt awful. Plus I'd get my head slammed every couple of seconds. So the whole experience was really a life changing moment. And that was the demarcation of me basically building a new life. Basically I said, I'm going to reconstruct Brian. My understanding of reality, my existential reality is what I want to go after. And I try, I mean, as much as that's possible as a human, but that's when I set out to rebuild everything. Was it the struggle of that? I mean, there's also just like the romantic poetic, it's a fricking mountain. Is a man in pain, psychological and physical struggling up a mountain, but it's just struggle just in the face of, just pushing through in the face of hardship or nature too, something much bigger than you. Was that the thing that just clicked? For me, it felt like I was just locked in with reality and it was a death match. In that moment, one of us is going to die. So you were pondering death, like not surviving. And that was the moment. And it was the summit to me was I'm going to come out on top and I can do this. And giving in was, it's like, I'm just done. And so it did, I locked in and that's why mountains are magical to me. I didn't expect that. I didn't design that. I didn't know that was going to be the case. It would not have been something I would have anticipated. But you are not the same man afterwards. Is there advice you can give to young people today that look at your story that's successful in many dimensions? Advice you can give to them about how to be successful in their career, successful in life, whatever path they choose? Yes, I would say listen to advice and see it for what it is. A mirror of that person and then map and know that your future is going to be in a zero principle land. And so what you're hearing today is a representation of what may have been the right principles to build upon previously, but they're likely depreciating very fast. And so I am a strong proponent that people ask for advice, but they don't take advice. So how do you take advice properly? It's in the careful examination of the advice. It's actually the person makes a statement about a given thing somebody should follow. The value is not doing that. The value is understanding the assumption stack they built, the assumption and knowledge stack they built around that body of knowledge. That's the value. It's not doing what they say. Considering the advice, but digging deeper to understand the assumption stack, like the full person. I mean, this is deep empathy, essentially, to understand the journey of the person that arrived at the advice. And the advice is just the tip of the iceberg that ultimately is not the thing that gives you. That's right. It could be the right thing to do. It could be the complete wrong thing to do, depending on the assumption stack. So you need to investigate the whole thing. Are there been people in your startup, in your business journey that have served that role of advice giver that's been helpful? Or do you feel like your journey felt like a lonely path? Or was it one that was, of course, we're all, we're all born and die alone. But do you fundamentally remember the experiences when you leaned on people at a particular moment in time that changed everything? The most significant moments of my memory, for example, like on Kilimanjaro, when Ike, some person I'd never met in Tanzania, was able to, in that moment, apparently see my soul when I was in this death match with reality. And he gave me the instructions, look up, step. And so there's magical people in my life that have done things like that. And I suspect they probably don't know. I probably should be better at identifying those things. But yeah, hopefully the, I suppose like a wisdom I would aspire to is to have the awareness and the empathy to be that for other people. Not a retail advertiser of advice, of tricks for life, but deeply meaningful and empathetic with a one-on-one context with people that it really can make a difference. Yeah, I actually kind of experience, I think about that sometimes. You have like an 18-year-old kid come up to you. It's not always obvious. It's not always easy to really listen to them. Like not the facts, but like see who that person is. I think people say that about being a parent is, you want to consider that you don't want to be the authority figure in a sense, that you really want to consider that there's a special, unique human being there with a unique brain that may be brilliant in ways that you are not understanding that you'll never be. And really try to hear that. So when given advice, there's something to that. Both sides should be deeply empathetic about the assumption stack. I love that terminology. What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? Of life. Why the hell are we here, Brian Johnson? We've been talking about brains and studying brains and you had this very eloquent way of describing life on earth as an optimization problem of the cost of intelligence going to zero. At first through the evolutionary process and then eventually through building, through our technology building more and more intelligent systems. You ever ask yourself why is doing that? Yeah. The answer to this question, again, the information value is more in the mirror it provides of that person, which is a representation of the technological, social, political context of the time. So if you asked this question a hundred years ago, you would get a certain answer that reflects that time period. Same thing would be true of a thousand years ago. It's difficult for a person to pull themselves out of their contextual awareness and offer truly original response. And so knowing that I am contextually influenced by the situation, that I am a mirror for our reality, I would say that in this moment, I think the real game going on is that evolution built a system of scaffolding intelligence that produced us. We are now building intelligence systems that are scaffolding higher dimensional intelligence, that's developing more robust systems of intelligence. In doing in that process with the cost going to zero, then the meaning of life becomes goal alignment, which is the negotiation of our conscious and unconscious existence. And then I'd say the third thing is, if we're thinking that we want to be explorers, is our technological progress is getting to a point where we could aspirationally say, we want to figure out what is really going on, really going on. Does any of this really make sense? Now we may be a hundred, 200, 500, a thousand years away from being able to poke our way out of whatever is going on. But it's interesting that we could even state an aspiration to say, we want to poke at this question. But I'd say in this moment of time, the meaning of life is that we can build a future state of existence that is more fantastic than anything we could ever imagine. The striving for something more amazing. And that defies expectations that we would consider bewildering and all the things that that that's, and I guess the last thing, if there's multiple meanings of life, it would be infinite games. You know, James Carson wrote the book, finite games, infinite games. The only game to play right now is to keep playing the game. And so this goes back to the algorithm of the Lex algorithm of diet soda and brisket and pursuing the passion. What I'm suggesting is there's a moment here where we can contemplate playing infinite games. Therefore it may make sense to err on the side of making sure one is in a situation to be playing infinite games if that opportunity arises. So it's just the landscape of possibilities changing very, very fast. And therefore our old algorithms of how we might assess risk assessment and what things we might pursue and why those assumptions may fall away very quickly. Well, I think I speak for a lot of people when I say that the game you, Mr. Brian Johnson, have been playing is quite incredible. Thank you so much for talking to me. Thanks, Lex. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Johnson. And thank you to Four Sigmatic, NetSuite, Grammarly, and ExpressVPN. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

{"text":"Speaker 4: Agenda Item three Resolution 318 37 amending adopting the policies and procedures that govern the re-use and disposal of real property owned by the City of Seattle, not subject to the city department jurisdiction, updating certain portions of the procedures relating to property, reuse and disposal for affordable housing, and adding provisions regarding the use of proceeds from surplus property disposal. The committee recommends a resolution be adopted as amended.\nSpeaker 7: Councilmember Mesquita Thank you very much, Mr. President. Mr. President, this legislation is a call for development done right? It's a call for development done through the community lens for the families and workers who want to and need to live within the city. It's in. It's in response to the call for density to help address the environmental impacts of displacement. Earlier today, I was listening to public testimony from the legislative body that oversees housing in Olympia. And Jaime Hahn, president of the Northwest Carpenters, testified saying the following. Despite the boom and despite the fact that our membership is overwhelmed with work, we are still not producing, producing enough housing, he said. Just like the police officers who cannot afford to live on the streets that they patrol. Just like the teachers who cannot afford to be neighbors to the children they educate, carpenters cannot afford to live in many of the homes we build with our own hands. This legislation is a response to the housing crisis and the injustice that many of us have talked about so far. We need housing. We need affordable housing. We need to house the homeless and we need to do it now. This legislation is in response to the call for reversing the exodus, especially of communities of color. As our friends from the tribal community said today. People who are the most vulnerable are losing out on the opportunity for housing. We're losing out on the opportunity for density in our neighborhood. We're losing the opportunity for more greenspace and public space for communities to engage and have opportunities for engagement. We're losing the opportunity for individuals to be able to live in the city that they work. And we need to make sure that all city property is used for the best use and not just sold at the highest price. Many of us know the root causes of the sad reality. The historic roots of redlining and restrictive zoning has often made it harder for working families, especially women and people of color, to have access to affordable housing. When housing is so limited in our city, it's often redlined communities where we see families and community organizations that are trying to serve those families who don't have the capacity to purchase new land and don't have the ability to create housing opportunities, especially mixed use opportunities for the density done in our for density in our communities. But when we remove the cost of land, the cost of producing affordable housing can be decreased by 15%. So in response to the comments that we've heard today, no, this legislation doesn't correct the injustice of redlining and it doesn't correct the injustice of having land taken. But it does help us begin the first steps necessary to make sure that more community organizations and individuals who are the most vulnerable have actual site control, and that we build the housing to respond our communities need. And now is the time where we have to act. Here is where we need to act at the local level. The Federal Department on Housing and Urban Development has just engaged in efforts to dismantle efforts to create affordable and fair housing. Here is where we have the opportunity, and I want to thank representative for you another woman of color who we should constantly thank when they are leading the effort, who passed House Bill 2382. She passed this earlier, this legislative session to make sure that we look at opportunities for us to take a step further and make sure that community has the opportunity to build the housing that we need on surplus property, that we commit ourselves to engaging and creating affordable housing to meet our fair housing goals, and that we are not only building housing but building community opportunities by making sure that housing is above child care facilities, above health facilities, next to public parks , and creating opportunities for small businesses to thrive on the first and second floors. And that we do this in a way that is built next to transit centers. And when we see maps of Seattle and where we know that displacement is occurring, especially for these most vulnerable communities, we have an obligation to do more. The community organizations who helped pull together this legislation have made it possible for us to now have tools in hand for us to take the next steps in living our values. And that is public land should be used for the best public use. And over the years coming up, I hope that we can act with urgency to make sure that these policies are set into place. Mr. President, there's six bullets that I'd like to read that outline what this legislation does, if I might.\nSpeaker 2: Please do. Councilmember.\nSpeaker 7: First, it sets a policy that requires the city to prioritize using surplus land for affordable housing in addition to parks and open spaces. Childcare and early learning centers. Educational facilities. Light routes. Light rail stations think little things like grocery stores so we can address food deserts. It allows for us to make sure that the land can also be leased, which means that the city maintains public ownership or partial ownership from municipal use. And that means that the property can be developed into affordable housing for mixed use. It directs the Office of Housing to partner with community organizations in areas of heightened risk of displacement, allowing for greater community ownership, site control and affordable housing to be developed through their lens. And it sets a benchmark that if a parcel is sold, if after an intense analysis, that the land is not going to be developed by the city in partnership with community organizations, that if it is sold, a goal of 80% of that revenue will be generated for parcels to go into affordable housing and into making sure that we meet our goals under the Equitable Development Initiative. It adds additional reporting from the Office of Housing regarding implementation to ensure accountability. So we're actually living our values and those organizations are serving the community that they intend to serve and that they're reflective of the community through their boards and leadership. It also cuts in time, cuts it in half the time for internal process in the city to review these parcels so we can build housing with urgency of the changes that I'm most excited about. It directs the Office of Housing to work with community organizations and to design affordable housing, especially for those who are at risk of displacement. To make sure that we are actually working with the communities that are at highest risk of displacement, instead of just assuming that that will happen with development and development is done right when community organizations are brought to the table, we can create the housing that we need and we can do it in a way that addresses the environmental impacts of displacement and as an effort to try to reverse some of the injustices that we talked about before. So I'm excited about this legislation, as you can tell. Mr. President, there's been a number of efforts that we have worked on together over this last year. But this is the piece of legislation that I think really helps us live our values in terms of how we can do a better job with publicly owned land and make sure that we get more affordable housing and community assets. This wouldn't have been possible without the organizations that you heard of today and a number of additional ones that I'd like to read very briefly, including folks from Puget Sound, Sage Got Green Interim CTA, El Centro 350, Seattle, Sierra Club, Campus Housing, Housing Development Consortium Future Wise of four Terra Enterprise Community Partners Chief. South Seattle Club. Seattle Indian Services Commission. Beacon Hill Development Group. Rainier Beach Action Coalition. Filipino Community Center Abundance of Hope Sustainable Seattle Sightline Mount Baker Housing Seattle Tech for Housing Seattle for everyone and so many more. I want to say very briefly before we get to amendments, a huge amount of appreciation to Sally Bagshaw. Thank you, Councilmember Bagshaw, to your team Allison, Dan, Brian and Linda for their ongoing work with us to make sure that we got this right. To Tracy Radcliff from central staff who constantly worked with us to make sure this was possible and to the intense work from our team, especially Michael Maddox and all of his research on this. I want to thank also as well Aretha Basu and Farida Cuevas, who helped shape this work and working with community organizations. This is a continuation of the work that you all worked on, I think, in 2017 within Councilmember Burgess. What we've done today is taking it to the next level in terms of what we mean by highest and best use of the parcels. And I'm really excited with this legislation. We will hopefully be able to see more. PLAZA Roberto Maya's does more Filipino community centers, more literal shopping places and more opportunities for, for example, Seattle Club as chief Seattle Club to acquire site control for production of permanently affordable housing to serve communities who've been left out and are at risk of displacement. And this is, I think, how we respond to the housing crisis today and also the housing crisis that will be here with us in 20, 30, 40 years if we don't act now. Thank you, Mr. President.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Catch from a skater. Any. My colleagues like to address the resolution. So we'll go with Councilmember Beckstrom.\nSpeaker 9: Thank you. I want to just say. Councilmember Mesquita, you and your office have been fabulous partners on this. Thank you very much for taking the lead. Michael Maddox, I know you're embarrassed in the background that we call you out, but truly working with you and with the folks in my office who've done that is make a big difference. I just want to say I completely concur that this is the right way to go and we simply need a whole lot more housing, a lot faster, which means much more resources in order to do this that people say, well, it costs so much money. And I want to remind my legislator friends that last year the housing trust fund offered $100 million, which was a great beginning, but not statewide. We could so easily use $100 million right here to build the kind of units that we need. And if we're doing full on brick and mortar, we know that it's about $30 million for 100 units. And if we want to look at some options, like what we've been arguing for around modular is to try some pilots to get some things built and up and on, just ready to go for people. I really want to encourage us to look at every possible alternative. And in that regard, I would like to say thanks to my King County colleagues, John Arthur Wilson and Adrian Quinn, who are helping us look at those kinds of opportunities across the county. We cannot do this alone. You will hear me say a thousand times. The city government can do anything, but we can't do everything. And we need help and we need money in order to get this going. So. Also, we've got the green space, the parks, the education, all the amendments that we talked about. Do you have an amendment, an amended version that we need to bring forward before we vote on this?\nSpeaker 7: I sure do.\nSpeaker 9: Great, July. Thank you. Please. So that's my comments. I just say. And what?\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. So why don't we take the amendments and then we could describe the the amended legislation and we have some closing comments. So you have, I believe, an amendment one councilmember mosquito.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. I think I unfortunately described the amendments as I was doing my spiel. So I do have two amendments, both just to clarify legislation. So the first is Amendment one, I'd move to amend Resolution 31837 by using substitute version five for substitute for version for the second.\nSpeaker 2: It has been second. So basically we're just accepting version since she actually spoke to the the new version. So substituting version five for version for any comments on the amendment. All those in favor of the amendment. But I.\nSpeaker 0: I.\nSpeaker 2: Opposed the ayes have it and amendment one has passed.\nSpeaker 7: Amendment two relates to attachment. I'd like to move to amend resolution 31837 attachment A by substituting version five for version for a second.\nSpeaker 2: It's been moved in second on the attachment. Any comments those in favor of amendment number two, which is again the attachment a subsequent version five for version for a. All those in favor say I. I opposed the ayes have it and those two amendments are passed. So we have an amended resolution and Casper bring back show you're through with your remarks, I assume. And Councilmember O'Brien, you have the floor, sir.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you so much again. Thank you. Thank you, Councilmember Mosqueda, for your work on this. And thanks community members for continuing to make sure that the city is focused on delivering as much affordable housing and using and prioritizing all of our resources towards that. I am thrilled to be supporting this going forward. I also want to acknowledge that there are there are surplus properties that are currently going through a process. Some of the homeowners spoke to that, specifically the Mercer Mega BLOCK, and I've been working closely on that and want to make sure that the process will maximize the amount, affordable housing and want to work with community members to really understand how we can do that to serve the best interest and get the most housing and in the neighborhoods where we need it most at the same time. So I think this resolution is a great step forward and we'll continue to work on those that are in the process.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Casper and Brian. I'll just say briefly councilmember skater that and I think what? What makes a difference in a good legislature legislator is the the ability by which they can get creative and really think outside the box and look at new problems and old solutions. And again, sort of put on their thinking hat and really push the envelope. And I think that's what you and your staff are doing. So I want to commend you on that. We've looked at surplus property and both from the generous Upton and for our utilities for years. But I think you've taken a much more aggressive approach and one that will better serve our residents and our our constituents throughout this city. So thank you for bringing forth this resolution. And with that, I think we are ready to vote. Are you ready to vote, Catherine Mosquito. Okay, all those in favor of adopting the resolution as amended. Please vote i. I those oppose vote no. The motion carries the resolution is adopted. Then Chair will sign it. Please read the next. Yeah, let's step on that. Please read the next agenda item.","label":1}

{"text":"Speaker 5: Shortly. This is where it is. Okay. Again, my name is Doug Biggs, executive director of the Alameda Point Collaborative. Just wanted to comment on a couple of things. One, I did follow up on last week's meeting with a letter further explaining the loss that the agency would incur if the election was done later. I'm often told that I am incoherent when I'm speaking in front of the council and hopefully that provided additional information. You needed to confirm that we would be at a loss. That is not the reason to have the election early, of course, because the additional cost to the city and the deferred costs of the facility itself. Regarding the agenda item related to things, the matters as they're written I think are very clear and well done. It's just a shame that we're at this point. I feel very bittersweet that this is a wonderful project that needs to happen. And I'm sorry that representatives of Friends of Crab Cove aren't here tonight to be able to talk about it and explain what they're doing. And further, I'm very sad that they're not continuing to talk with us to come to a community agreement around how that program can operate. Well, within the community, we have a right to create that project. They have a right to raise concerns. It can be addressed without this. And it's just a shame we have to get to this point. But here we are. Thank you very.\nSpeaker 0: Much. Thank you, Mr. Biggs. All right. And I have no further public speakers. So with that, the. Okay. So we have two resolutions. The the revised. Ballot language on the initiative and then the. The resolution, the language on the Cities Initiative, the Caring Alameda Act. I'm going to suggest that we start with the initiative first. So Council wants to start and I will just add that we had two subcommittees working. Councilmember Vela and I. Revised language for the initiative. The proposed initiative measure to change the designation on Mackay. Mackay in both the general PEN, the zoning amendment and Vice Mayor in Knox Wyatt and Councilmember Ody work together to draft the ballot measure, introducing an ordinance entitled The Caring Alameda Act. But let's start with the the initiative itself. There is proposed revised ballot language. Have you all had a chance to review that? Any questions? Thoughts? Councilman Brody.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. I just had a quick question, so. This should say 15473. Right? Yes. So then the resolution also should say one five, 473 at the whole.\nSpeaker 1: So then before the meeting.\nSpeaker 3: I realize the mayor wants to talk about this first, but then the second one also says one four, 573.\nSpeaker 1: Which is seven four.\nSpeaker 3: That one should say seven four. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Okay. So when we when we make a motion, we have to motion to amend it. Is it read the right.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, it's it's pretty and it's a typographical errors, so I can correct it.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. The 73 and 74. Okay. What was that, the extent of your copy.\nSpeaker 3: Of my question? I'll just listen to comments.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 3: And chime in when you call on me.\nSpeaker 0: All right. Very, very well, then. Let's see. Any when. Councilmember Vela. Well, we obviously were the authors you went to speak with.\nSpeaker 6: I think the intent of our language here was just to make sure that, you know, we spent some time reviewing the initiative itself and to make it very. Responsive to what the initiative purported to do. And so in that respect, we made a couple of changes. Most of them were to the structure of the question itself.\nSpeaker 0: Right. As mayor.\nSpeaker 4: Just and know, I can go either way on this and I thought this was fantastic.\nSpeaker 0: But felt he had to say that. No, no.\nSpeaker 4: I think I think it's I think it's written really well. I wonder if we want to consider changing the term, the word former to existing former federal. They are federal buildings. They continue to be federal buildings until. They are no longer an existing. Also I think is clear that they are there and not in some giant state of disarray.\nSpeaker 0: So I will actually chime in in response to your comment. The note that I had made was to describe them as vacant federal buildings, because I think that's informative to the public that there there is no use being made of them. So would that that was the the comment of the suggested minor amendment I was going to make.\nSpeaker 6: Councilmember Vela And it was one of the points that we had discussed about the the wording there. And we I think we had gone back and forth. So I'm fine with that change to make it all right.\nSpeaker 0: And. Councilman Brody.\nSpeaker 3: So. Help me. How many words out here are there? Do we have.\nSpeaker 0: We read.\nSpeaker 3: One.\nSpeaker 0: Or two. Oh, um. What's your. What's your thought? I think we're below that.\nSpeaker 3: Below was the suggestion to change form or to vacant or maybe add of vacant former federal buildings. No, no, not to add.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: They. It's federal poverty. It's GSA.\nSpeaker 3: It's not a former federal building. So.\nSpeaker 6: That would be factually incorrect.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So Bacon is probably a better word. Okay. I'm fine with.\nSpeaker 0: That. Okay. And Councilmember De, thank you in the way and want to say.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you very much for taking the time out of your busy schedules, both of you, for putting this together. But other than that, I.\nSpeaker 0: Think you're welcome. Thank you for thanking us. Okay. So so we can agree to that wording that might have wording change. Okay. So with that, then, do I have a motion to amend resolution number 15473 calling for a special election in the city of Alameda. Probably can let the um the we have if many no no worries we have many meetings going on this evening under one roof. Hi, everyone. Okay. Okay. Do we have a motion?\nSpeaker 3: I'll make a motion to adopt the resolution. Obviously. Updating the typo from 141547 2 to 1 5473 throughout and changing the word on the draft ballot initiative conversion of former federal buildings to conversion of vacant federal buildings.\nSpeaker 0: The motion to have a second.\nSpeaker 6: Second.\nSpeaker 0: All right. All those in favor. I opposed. Abstain. Okay. So the motion passes for four? Yes. And one abstention. Thank you. Now we're going to move on to item, not item that to the resolution. This is the Caring Alameda Act. And this is. Resolution number 15474. And this is submitting to the electors an ordinance entitled The Carrying Alameda Act. Okay. Any discussion on this one? A vice mayor. And that's why I.\nSpeaker 4: Would simply we use the term existing in arts and I would simply suggest we use the vacant buildings so that both both initiatives are describing the buildings in the same factual way.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So let's see.\nSpeaker 6: So in the second line.\nSpeaker 4: Shall the ordinance in the City Council's actions to permit re-use of vacant buildings?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Okay. So again.\nSpeaker 4: We could add federal as well as federal buildings at the same. That's a good.\nSpeaker 0: Idea. Yeah, I think it's good to have that consistency. Good point. Okay. Yes. To permit the re-use of exactly vacant federal buildings would replace the word existing. Correct. All right. Any other comments? Suggestions? Nimitz canceled.\nSpeaker 3: Good question. And I don't know if the public's been informed on this, but, you know, should they both fail? And maybe the city clerk comment on what happens to the action the council took already.\nSpeaker 0: I think we might ask the city attorney's office to come in and. No, no.\nSpeaker 3: Either one. I don't care.\nSpeaker 2: If. If both measures fail, the council action that it took back in December to change the land use designations would remain in play, that it would not negate or cause those actions to be null and void. It would continue in full force, in effect.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. So even though we're using the word confirming. If it fails, it's not erased or invalidated or anything.\nSpeaker 0: Right. And and that was explained in a memo we got this evening.\nSpeaker 3: But just for the.\nSpeaker 0: For the sake of the benefit.\nSpeaker 3: Of the public. And I agree with those changes. You know, we did work a lot on this. So I appreciate everyone's everyone's appreciation of it.\nSpeaker 0: I do as well. I do as well. And this was a quick turnaround time. We all had deadlines. And thank you all for for meeting them. We've been working very hard in our first week and a half on the job. Um. Okay. So I am looking for a motion to. Amend resolution number 15474 and. As as previously described, is there a motion to approve.\nSpeaker 4: So so moved with the change as set of 15 or 74 and.\nSpeaker 0: And as the language change as noted. Okay.\nSpeaker 4: As noted.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Motion. That a second.\nSpeaker 3: Sure. I'll second guess.\nSpeaker 0: I'll write the motion and it's been moved and seconded. All in favor. I am opposed. Abstain. So the motion passes with four in favor and one abstention. And I just want to say in closing that there is still time. If the Friends of Crab Cove were so moved and so inclined to withdraw their initiative, they have until 5 p.m. tomorrow, Friday, January 11th. And although City Council, City Hall and the city clerk's office is closed, there is a mechanism in place whereby there they can email the city clerk up until 5 p.m. tomorrow. So it's not over till it's over. And we will. We'll see what happens. But. With that. We've we've disposed of that item and we have no further business. All right. So with that.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to get my appreciation that the city attorney's office was really, really we worked fast and hard, but they were also very responsive. I would just want to give my great appreciation to.\nSpeaker 2: And Selena in particular should get the should get the kudos here. I looked at it that she did the hard work.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. I that that is that is well stated Councilmember Vela.\nSpeaker 6: And I would like to note that the 9212 elections report, which I know that we based our our question off of as well, was very helpful and informative in terms of outlining all of the issues at play and streamlining it. So and Celina did a fantastic job on that. Those are very difficult reports to put together in a way that is linear and easy to follow. And I thought it was one of the best ones I've ever seen.\nSpeaker 0: So and I will just echo my thanks and appreciation for the quick and comprehensive response back. We got to our questions up to and including today going into this meeting. All right, Councilman Brody, I'll.\nSpeaker 3: Just say ditto to all.\nSpeaker 0: That, you know. Nice. All right. Councilmember de seconded. Okay. All right. With that, we will. We're out of here. Thanks. Everyone will be back Tuesday the 15th for a regular meeting to.","label":1}

To reach the World Championship event these athletes must be incredibly dedicated and goal-focused. You don\u2019t just show-up and automatically get a spot in Kona. Competitors must qualify through rigorous competition against others with similar talent and passion levels.\n\nThe second example is the Broadway musical Hamilton. I\u2019ve seen it in person, streamed it at home and listened to the soundtrack. The writing by Lin Manuel Miranda is genius, the choreography is fantastic and the performers were perfectly selected for their roles. Put it all together and the performance is powerful and something I wish everyone could see. I have neither the confidence nor the ability to perform in Hamilton (or any other show for that matter), but I\u2019m thankful for those who are able to do so at such a high level.\n\nElite athletes and Broadway performers are easy to single out as having above-average abilities. However, I\u2019ve had the good fortune to work with individuals in the business world that are top-tier in their own disciplines. Every one of them had at least one thing in common. They recognize and embrace the effort required to be a high performer.\n\nWhat is the Effort Intersection?\n\nEffort is the intersection of foresight and work-ethic (see Intersection 29 image below). Foresight without work-ethic is an arm-chair quarterback. Work-ethic without foresight is wheel-spinning in the mud.\n\nConceptually, effort seems easy to define\u2026just try hard. Using effort to get results though is more than just trying hard. It\u2019s also intentional. In my experience, results from effort are at their best when the questions of why, when, how, where and what are considered in expending effort.\n\nForesight\n\nForesight addresses the \u201cwhy\u201d\u2026Why expend effort? While it contributes to some of the other questions, it is primarily the rationale driver for effort. We see potential or an objective that\u2019s possible but requires effort and we make the deliberate choice to either put effort into achieving that objective or use our effort toward a different end.\n\nForesight doesn\u2019t imply the ability to predict the future, rather an openness to possibility. It also indicates an understanding of consequences. If effort is put into task A the outcome is different than if effort is put into task B. Foresight informs decision making about the allocation of resources.\n\nIntersection 29: Effort = Foresight + Work-Ethic\n\nImage by Brett Simpson\n\nWork-Ethic\n\nWork-ethic is the willingness and ability to put effort into action with the intention of achieving something. This includes the motivation to invest in the full lifecycle of accomplishment. Think about the athletes or performers mentioned above. They put countless hours, many times over years, into practicing, failing, iterating, exploring, growing, overcoming and finishing, in order to meet some personal and \/ or professional goal.\n\nWork-ethic is how we choose to allocate the resources inherently available to us. Our time, effort, intelligence and emotion. We know that simply working at something doesn\u2019t guarantee success. But we also know that rarely is success achieved without being worked for.\n\nWhat Can Leaders Do?\n\nLeaders know the individuals on their teams and the level of effort they can expect from each. They also know that the team itself is an entity that puts forth effort. Because of that, there are likely team members whose strength lies in foresight and others whose strength lies in work-ethic, as well as those who are gifted with both to varying degrees. The challenge and opportunity for leaders is to build and use their teams to maximize the effort impact of each individual and the team overall.\n\nWhen it comes to effort, the opposite of success is waste. Inefficiency is always a risk. Sometimes it can\u2019t be avoided as individuals or teams are learning and growing. Ideally, leaders recognize this and make the necessary adjustments to optimize the talent, passion and utility of everyone on the team.\n\nWrap Up & Up Next\n\nEffort, if defined as simply trying, is easy. Effort, if defined as when foresight and work-ethic meet, is more complex but has a greater potential impact in the long-run.\n\nNext time we\u2019ll examine the 30th intersection of performance, which is the Alignment Intersection.\n\nIn this series of articles, we explore The Intersections of Performance, of which there are 30. The Intersections of Performance framework is based on the experience and insights of Brett Simpson, Managing Director of Elevate Simply, over his 20+ years of leadership in large and small organizations, and as an entrepreneur, advisor and investor.","label":0}
{"text":"I should like first of all. Sir, to convey to you my most sincere congratulations on your election to the presidency of the General Assembly. You represent a continent that plays a primary and increasingly authoritative role on the world scene and a country with an ancient civilization and traditions to which Italy is bound by ties of warm friendship and co-operation. I also wish to extend my warmest thanks and congratulations to your predecessor. Ambassador Jaime de Pinies.\nOnce again from this rostrum I should like to pay a tribute to the Secretary-General Mr. Perez de Cuellar, with whom we enjoy relations of profound trust and esteem, and reiterate the Italian Government's appreciation of his persevering efforts to promote the principles of the United Nations Charter and strengthen the role and machinery of the Organization.\nThe Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs of the United Kingdom, in his capacity as current President of the European Community, illustrated this morning the views of its 12 member States on the major issues today facing the international community. Those views, which we share, are the expression of policies which are aimed at promoting greater stability and co-operation in international relations.\nThe dramatic and sometimes tragic events we have witnessed in the past few months have made us acutely aware, perhaps as never before, that the world in which we live is one of interdependence. We have seen how the effects of conflict^ tensions can jeopardize global security and gained a better understanding of the interrelationship of the economies of different and even distant areas. We have also had direct proof that man's achievements in science and technology, both positive and negative, know no frontiers.\nIt was for this reason that we decided to make co-operation and dialog the central theme of the celebration of the International Year of Peace which took place in Rome last July. That celebration was, in fact, marked by a meeting devoted to 'dialog as the universal foundation of peace'. I should like to take this opportunity to thank the Secretary-General for agreeing to participate in the meeting and address it.\ndialog is needed more than ever before in the field of science. If any lesson has been learned from the tragic events of Chernobyl it is that science, in releasing new and unforeseeable powerful energies and resources, has certainly opened up possibilities for progress, but has also liberated forces which could destroy us. We therefore need intensive collaboration among scientists, which will prove possible only if we are able to translate fully into reality the idea of an international scientific community without frontiers.\nWe should, however, harbor no illusion that this scientific community will materialize spontaneously. As Government leaders, we must, rather, work to encourage its realization. We must therefore think of new instruments better suited to present needs. At the scientific meetings which took place in Ericem Sicily, and which Italy not only hosted but fully supported, participants put forward ideas, proposals and concrete programs, such as the program for open laboratories, which are, in our view, a step in the right direction and which are starting to attract the attention of Governments.\nThe establishment in Geneva of the World Laboratory is a concrete example of the extent to which the scientific community can make a concrete contribution to the East-west and the North-South dialog and to the building of peace. Renowned scientists, academicians and Nobel Prize winners, including numerous representatives of the third world as well as prestigious institutions, have signed the constituent act of the Laboratory. Their goal is to promote science without secrets or frontiers, in the just belief that the free circulation of scientific information is a powerful instrument capable of creating a climate of safely and mutual trust in East and West and in North and South.\nIn the most important negotiations on arms limitations, in which the main participants are the United States and the Soviet Union, the parties have put forward at the negotiating table various proposals which, in our view, indicate their common determination to achieve reductions in the most destructive weapons. A new summit meeting between the two major Powers, while responding to the expectations of so many countries, could give an irreversible impetus to this trend.\nA balance of forces at levels lower than those existing today must be achieved, but essential requirements must be respected: such a balance must be established at the global level, taking into account the interrelationship which exists between the various components of military equilibrium. The Italian Government, for its part, attaches great importance to the prospects which seem to be opening up for negotiations aimed at achieving balanced reductions of conventional forces in Europe.\nA decisive role in the pursuit of disarmament agreements is also being played by the Geneva Conference on Disarmament. We hope that the work of the Conference will result, inter alia, in the speedy conclusion of a convention for a total and verifiable ban on chemical weapons.\nIn the same spirit we welcome the constructive compromise agreement that was reached at the Conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe, held in Stockholm. We hope that this agreement will be the basis for a new and more constructive approach to a problem which is of primary concern to European countries. This agreement augurs well for the future, in our view, because it signals a more general willingness to seek compromise.\nWe hope in particular that the third follow-up meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, in Vienna, will result in a qualitative change in East-West relations affecting not on]y dealings between States but the situation of their citizens.\nAnother area in which dialog and international co-operation are necessary, is that of terrorism, which is the very antithesis of dialog, reason and persuasion. Terrorism is a grave threat to peace. Mo political situation, however unjust, can justify any departure for even a moment from the principles of law. Nor can there be any justification for the conduct of those who deliberately disregard their obligation to seek political solutions to their problems, thereby jeopardizing the well-established supremacy of law over force. If we stray from the path of law we have anarchy and the triumph of irrationality.\nI believe, nevertheless, that there is a growing consensus on the need for a joint, organized response to that phenomenon of such alarming dimensions, beginning with the determination and identification of responsibilities. Solidarity in the fight against terrorism can already be seen at the regional level within the framework of the European Community and that of the summit meeting of the seven industrialized countries in Tokyo, as well as in the broader framework of the United Nations.\nIn this context may I recall the initiative taken by Italy - in association with other friendly countries - in proposing a convention on the safety of shipping and our support for the Canadian initiative on airport security. Moreover, Italy is convinced of the need for stricter compliance with the norms of general international law, including the Vienna conventions on diplomatic and consular relations. For this reason we recently adopted measures for the control of diplomatic pouches. We hope that other countries will follow our example, thus contributing to international co-operation in suppressing the traffic in arms.\nIt is essential also, in my view, to work to remove those causes of tension that offer terrorism alibis which are in some cases far too easy. I am thinking in particular of those areas where crises are most acute, such as the Middle East. Throughout the area there are manifestations of a profound desire for peace, justice and attempts at dialog which are even breaking through the traditional psychological barriers between the Arab world and Israel, and between Israel and the Soviet Union. However, we note with regret that certain preconditions are still being maintained and that there is no prospect of their being reconsidered in the future. This prevents achievement of the two necessary bases for a just and lasting solution of the Middle East conflict: the right of all States in the region, including Israel, to a peaceful and secure existence and the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.\nA dialog must finally be started on that basis and in pursuance of those objectives, with the indispensable participation of all the parties concerned and the constructive support of those countries which are in a position to play a significant role in the region. Italy, together with its European partners, remains determined to contribute to that dialog, to the best of its ability and with the utmost dedication. We must also work to bring to an end the state of blind and chaotic violence prevailing in Lebanon and to promote a frank and sincere dialog between all the communities of that country. Italy is contributing to the stability and security of at least part of that country through its participation in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). We believe that United Nations forces still have an important role to play in that area. That role is, first of all, the one decided by the Security Council in its resolution 425 (1978), which must be respected and implemented in its entirety. At the same time it would be unjust to ignore the positive effects of the presence of the peace-keeping Force in southern Lebanon, even under present conditions. For this reason we must carefully consider whether withdrawal of the Force would not entail the risk of further jeopardizing chances for a positive evolution of the situation.\nWe would like to see the method of dialog applied to other situations in areas adjacent to the Mediterranean region where distressing and dangerous crises persist and in some cases are escalating. I am thinking in particular of the conflict between Iraq and Iran which continues to cause tragic losses of life and large-scale material damage.\nOur Organization has repeatedly issued resolute and specific calls for peace, and no effort has been spared to initiate peace negotiations. We all remember the efforts deployed to this end by the late Olof Palme. We believe that the Security Council should make another solemn appeal for a cease-fire and a return to peace. Should such an appeal go unheeded, it would be necessary to use all the means available under the Charter of the United Nations for the restoration of order in a situation in which it was clearly violated.\nAt the special session on Africa held last May, Africa's problems were confronted in a spirit of constructive realism. The African Governments recognize that they themselves bear the primary responsibility for the continent's economic take-off and have undertaken to pursue policies designed to start an autonomous development process with the co-operation of the international community.\nItaly intends to make a contribution to follow-up action to the special session. In regard to the central problem of external indebtedness and its consequences, I intend to inform the ministers for foreign affairs of sub-Saharan Africa of our intention when the Italian delegation meets with them later this week. Our purpose is to try to move to the stage of concrete operative solutions, which may also serve as an experiment and an example.\nWhile the method of dialog is making headway, for example, in the direct talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, unfortunately we find that within South Africa repression and violence are being stepped up and the prospects of peacefully eliminating a system based on racist principles are receding. The international community must continue to exert every effort to promote favorable conditions for the initiation of a dialog between the Government and the political and social forces in the country aimed at building a society based on justice, equality and the full realization of the legitimate civil and political rights of all South Africans.\nThe South African Government cannot continue to ignore the unanimous reprobation of the international community. The Twelve recently decided to send a clear signal to the South African Government by moving from the stage of restrictive measures to that of sanctions in the full sense of the term. At the same time they will continue to assist the black population of South Africa and neighboring countries.\n\nThe process of restoring and strengthening free and democratic institutions in Latin America certainly offers grounds for hope, in spite of the fact that freedom continues to be denied in a country like Chile where democratic traditions are among the oldest in the region. Political gains are, however, in danger of being nullified by a widespread economic crisis, with all its disruptive effects. We must therefore exercise constant vigilance and concretely commit ourselves to preventing social forces hostile to democracy, and the economic situation, from jeopardizing results that have been achieved at great cost.\nIn Asia, a crisis like the one prevailing in Afghanistan has repercussions which are felt well beyond the regional context. We hope that the proximity talks held under the auspices of the Secretary-General will lead to positive developments. Italy continues to believe that a negotiated solution of that crisis must lead to a genuine and speedy withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and the restoration of the independence and self-determination of that country.\nA similar solution should be sought for the question of Kampuchea. We are therefore deeply concerned at the absence of even the first signs of a dialog capable of leading to a just and peaceful settlement of that problem.\nThe system of dialog and multilateral co-operation, in which we believe, must go hand in hand with a healthy development of international economic collaboration.\nMany problems remain to be resolved in this field. Among them, besides the problem of indebtedness - which I have already mentioned - is the need to ensure that international trade enjoys a sustained and balanced growth, which will require the elimination of protectionist practices, the removal of non-tariff barriers, and also a redefinition of national policies to support agriculture. The tasks confronting the United Nations affect not only relations between States but, in the current circumstances, also the well-being and progress of peoples owing to problems such as terrorism and drugs that tend to erode the very fabric of our societies. The problem of drugs, for instance, is an international phenomenon with complex structures and manifestations. It therefore requires an international response. For this reason Italy puts high hopes in the action of the United Nations, particularly the United Nations Fund for Drug Abuse Control (UNFDAC), in this field and is making a substantial contribution to it in terms of efforts and\nfinancial resources.\nIf the United Nations system is to meet appropriately such a vast range of\nresponsibilities and commitments, it must constantly improve the efficiency of its\nmachinery. We therefore support the action taken by the Secretary-General and the\nGeneral Assembly to ensure sound, effective administration of this Organization.\nin that spirit we welcome the proposals contained in the report of the Group of\nHigh-Level intergovernmental Experts. However, our goal must be clearly\nunderstood: we want to strengthen the United Nations system, certainly not promote\na reduction in its role.\nItaly is a member of the two great, free political systems of the West, the\nAtlantic Alliance and the European Community. In our view this strengthens our\ncapacity to participate fully in the life and activities of the broader\nmultilateral system represented by the United Nations. The process of European\nintegration, which Italy pursues with particular conviction, has the purpose of\nincreasing the capability of European countries to contribute to stability in\ninternational relations and to removing tensions and conflicts, promoting economic\nand social development and co-operation and, lastly, reaffirming those values of\nfreedom, democracy and respect for human rights that are an integral part of\nEuropean civilization.\nIt is in this spirit that Italy is participating in the building of a Europe which we believe is bound in the not too distant figure to become the main partner of all States Members of this Organization that share the same objectives of peace\nand progress.\n\n","label":1}

{"text":"I'm going to talk about your mindset. Does your mindset correspond to my dataset? (Laughter) If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it? When I talk to my students about global issues, and I listen to them in the coffee break, they always talk about \"we\" and \"them.\" And when they come back into the lecture room I ask them, \"What do you mean with \"we\" and \"them\"? \"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world,\" they say. \"We learned it in college.\" And what is the definition then? \"The definition? Everyone knows,\" they say. But then you know, I press them like this. So one girl said, very cleverly, \"It's very easy. Western world is a long life in a small family. Developing world is a short life in a large family.\" And I like that definition, because it enabled me to transfer their mindset into the dataset. And here you have the dataset. So, you can see that what we have on this axis here is size of family. One, two, three, four, five children per woman on this axis. And here, length of life, life expectancy, 30, 40, 50. Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world. And really this is about the bedroom. Whether the man and woman decide to have small family, and take care of their kids, and how long they will live. It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know, you can live long. And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted \u2014 the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here, which had large families and short life. Developing world. And we had one set of countries up there which was the western world. They had small families and long life. And you are going to see here the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime. Then the developing countries applied soap and water, vaccination. And all the developing world started to apply family planning. And partly to USA who help to provide technical advice and investment. And you see all the world moves over to a two child family, and a life with 60 to 70 years. But some countries remain back in this area here. And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here. We have Liberia. We have Congo. So we have countries living there. So the problem I had is that the worldview that my students had corresponds to reality in the world the year their teachers were born. (Laughter) (Applause) And we, in fact, when we have played this over the world. I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week, and I could see the wrong concept even active people in United States had, that they didn't realize the improvement of Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States. Look here when I move them forward. Here we go. They catch up. There's Mexico. It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions. There was less than five percent of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this. This great nation, Mexico, has the problem that arms are coming from North, across the borders, so they had to stop that, because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know. But if I would change this axis here, I would instead put income per person. Income per person. I can put that here. And we will then see a completely different picture. By the way, I'm teaching you how to use our website, Gapminder World, while I'm correcting this, because this is a free utility on the net. And when I now finally got it right, I can go back 200 years in history. And I can find United States up there. And I can let the other countries be shown. And now I have income per person on this axis. And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time. And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years, on par with Afghanistan today. And what has happened in the world, I will show now. This is instead of studying history for one year at university. You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing. (Laughter) You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe, and the yellow one, which is the United States, they get richer and richer and also start to get healthier and healthier. And this is now 100 years ago, where the rest of the world remains behind. Here we come. And that was the influenza. That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it? It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy. And then we come up. Not until independence started. Look here You have China over there, you have India over there, and this is what has happened. Did you note there, that we have Mexico up there? Mexico is not at all on par with the United States, but they are quite close. And especially, it's interesting to see China and the United States during 200 years, because I have my oldest son now working for Google, after Google acquired this software. Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this. And my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing. So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know? And my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing, in China, he got a long-term perspective. Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google, he should develop by quarter, or by half-year. Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go. But in China they look generation after generation because they remember the very embarrassing period, for 100 years, when they went backwards. And then they would remember the first part of last century, which was really bad, and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward. But this was 1963. Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China, and then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started this amazing move forward. Isn't it strange to see that the United States first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich? Whereas China could get healthy much earlier, because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition, and then also benefits of penicillin and vaccines and family planning. And Asia could have social development before they got the economic development. So to me, as a public health professor, it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now. Because what you see here, what you see here is the flat world of Thomas Friedman, isn't it. It's not really, really flat. But the middle income countries \u2014 and this is where I suggest to my students, stop using the concept \"developing world.\" Because after all, talking about the developing world is like having two chapters in the history of the United States. The last chapter is about present, and president Obama, and the other is about the past, where you cover everything from Washington to Eisenhower. Because Washington to Eisenhower, that is what we find in the developing world. We could actually go to Mayflower to Eisenhower, and that would be put together into a developing world, which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way, which have great entrepreneurs, but also have the collapsing countries. So, how could we make better sense about this? Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could look at income distribution. This is the income distribution of peoples in the world, from $1. This is where you have food to eat. These people go to bed hungry. And this is the number of people. This is $10, whether you have a public or a private health service system. This is where you can provide health service for your family and school for your children, and this is OECD countries: Green, Latin America, East Europe. This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia. And this is how the world changed. It changed like this. Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia? And it goes over here? And I come now, into projections, but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because \u2014 (Laughter) that's where the projections are not valid any longer. Probably the world will do this. and then it will continue forward like this. But more or less, this is what will happen, and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided. We have the high income countries here, with the United States as a leading power; we have the emerging economies in the middle, which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout; and we have the low income countries here. Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes, they have been saving, you know, over the last decade. And here we have the low income countries where entrepreneurs are. And here we have the countries in collapse and war, like Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur. We have all this at the same time. That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened in the developing world. Because it's so different, what has happened there. And that's why I suggest a slightly different approach of what you would call it. And you have huge differences within countries also. I heard that your departments here were by regions. Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, East Asia, Arab states, East Europe, Latin America, and OECD. And on this axis, GDP. And on this, heath, child survival, and it doesn't come as a surprise that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom. But when I split it, when I split it into country bubbles, the size of the bubbles here is the population. Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different. There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa. And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian, Arab world. Now all your different departments. East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries. And here were are. We have a continuum in the world. We cannot put it into two parts. It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here, building, building countries. It's Lincoln here, advancing them. It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries. And then it's United States today, up here. And we have countries all this way. Now, this is the important thing of understanding how the world has changed. At this point I decided to make a pause. (Laughter) And it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world, to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers, for Demographic Health Survey. Many are not aware of \u2014 no, this is not a joke. This is very serious. It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring during 25 years of the very good methodology for measuring child mortality that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world. (Applause) And it is U.S. government at its best, without advocacy, providing facts, that it's useful for the society. And providing data free of charge on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much. Quite the opposite of the World Bank, who compiled data with government money, tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit, in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way. (Applause) But the people doing that at the World Bank are among the best in the world. And they are highly skilled professionals. It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do. And when it comes to free data and transparency, United States of America is one of the best. And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor. (Laughter) And I'm not paid to come here, no. I would like to show you what happens with the data, what we can show with this data. Look here. This is the world. With income down there and child mortality. And what has happened in the world? Since 1950, during the last 50 years we have had a fall in child mortality. And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this. And we had an increase in income. And the blue former developing countries are mixing up with the former industrialized western world. We have a continuum. But we still have, of course, Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries as we have had, always, in history. And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today about a completely new approach to do it. And how fast has this happened? Well, MDG 4. The United States has not been so eager to use MDG 4. But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it, because it's the only child mortality that we can measure. And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year. Let's see what Sweden has done. We used to boast about fast social progress. That's where we were, 1900. 1900, Sweden was there. Same child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990, though they had lower income. They started very well. They used the aid well. They vaccinated the kids. They get better water. And they reduced child mortality, with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden. I run Sweden the same 16 year period. Second round, it's Sweden, 1916, against Egypt, 1990. Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here. They get safe water, they get food for the poor, and they get malaria eradicated. 5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal. And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here. Brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last 16 years, and they go faster than Sweden. This means that the world is converging. The middle income countries, the emerging economy, they are catching up. They are moving to cities, where they also get better assistance for that. Well the Swedish students protest at this point. They say, \"This is not fair, because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics that were not available for Sweden. We have to do real-time competition.\" Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born. Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden. It's the most tropical country in the world, a marshland on the equator. And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent. But then they started to grow their economy. And they made the social investment. They got away malaria. They got a magnificent health system that beat both the U.S. and Sweden. We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden! (Applause) All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals. These yellow are just about to be doing this. These red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved. Not simplistic extrapolation. We have to really find a way of supporting those countries in a better way. We have to respect the middle income countries on what they are doing. And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world. This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries. The blue is Africa. The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected. You see the tragedy in South Africa there. About 20 percent of the adult population are infected. And in spite of them having quite a high income, they have a huge number of HIV infected. But you also see that there are African countries down here. There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa. There's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa that has the same level as Sweden and United States. And there are others who are extremely high. And I will show you that what has happened in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy in Africa and a good governance, Botswana. They have a very high level. It's coming down. But now it's not falling, because there, with help from PEPFAR, it's working with treatment. And people are not dying. And you can see it's not that easy, that it is war which caused this. Because here, in Congo, there is war. And here, in Zambia, there is peace. And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher. If I split Tanzania in its income, the richer 20 percent in Tanzania has more HIV than the poorest one. And it's really different within each country. Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different. And this is the situation you see. It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation, probably of concurrent sexual partnership among part of the heterosexual population in some countries, or some parts of countries, in south and eastern Africa. Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue. Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place, in the way it can be done there. So to just end up, there are things of suffering in the one billion poorest, which we don't know. Those who live beyond the cellphone, those who have yet to see a computer, those who have no electricity at home. This is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years elucidating in Africa. It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation. It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s. It's similar to other nutritional diseases. It will never affect a rich person. We have seen it here in Mozambique. This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania. You never heard about the disease. But it's much more than Ebola that has been affected by this disease. Cause crippling throughout the world. And over the last two years, 2,000 people has been crippled in the southern tip of Bandundu region. That used to be the illegal diamond trade, from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola. That has now disappeared, and they are now in great economic problem. And one week ago, for the first time, there were four lines on the Internet. Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in peaceful low income countries. There is still mystery in one billion. And we have to have more concepts than just developing countries and developing world. We need a new mindset. The world is converging, but \u2014 but \u2014 but not the bottom billion. They are still as poor as they've ever been. It's not sustainable, and it will not happen around one superpower. But you will remain one of the most important superpowers, and the most hopeful superpower, for the time to be. And this institution will have a very crucial role, not for United States, but for the world. So you have a very bad name, State Department. This is not the State Department. It's the World Department. And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much. (Applause)","label":1}

I might take a breath, but.\nSpeaker 0: Not a real problem.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. I want to just sort of apologize in advance because I'm pinch hitting for a sick colleague who was supposed to do this presentation tonight. So it's going to be a little choppy for me, I'm sure, and I'll be reading more than I usually do. So bear with me. And thank you for the water, Kelli, to get me through this. So tonight we have the what's commonly known as the Berkeley Annex three rezoning applications for the that cover portions of the 70 acre site. There are three applications in front of you council bills, five, 22, five, 23 and 524. Going to walk through each each application separately. They cover three different parts of the 70 acres. They do not total 70 acres. You're going to see more Buckley Annex rezoning applications in the near future for the remaining parts. So these are all rezonings for future planned residential development within the Buckley Annex redevelopment area. And so with that, I will start first. This is Council Bill 522. This is a request for a rezoning of a portion of the Buckley Annex. And here we'll walk you through its location, approximately Monaco and First Avenue. It's within the Lowry Field statistical neighborhood. We're beginning to hone in. So you can see more specifically where this is. This covers, I think, about 14, 15 acres in the northwest corner of the Buckley annexed property. Its context is immediately south of the Mayfair neighborhood, east across Moore Park and across Moore Park neighborhood and close to the north, the existing north with the Lowry neighborhood that's comprised of single unit housing and the like. The Schlozman library site you might be familiar with at the corner of First and Quebec. This provide this slide provides a brief history about the Buckley Annex and its plans for ultimately its redevelopment. It was the a federal facility, of course, through this from the seventies through as recently as 2005, when the comprehensive plan was done and the reuse plan for Lowry was done and blueprint Denver. There was no knowledge at that point in time that this portion of the Lowry field would be available for redevelopment. So it was not planned for redevelopment nor mentioned in the early reuse plans. But in 2005, the Department of Defense, the Air Force, announced the closure of this portion of Lowry Field as well, and the relocation of all federal services offsite in 2008, the Buckley Annex redevelopment plan was completed by the quasi governmental entity of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. The Redevelopment Authority is a quasi governmental body that has the authority given to it by the City Council of Denver to plan for the ultimate redevelopment of Lowry. The Buckley Annex redevelopment plan was not adopted by the city, but adopted by the Redevelopment Authority. After a very comprehensive and wide ranging public discussion and public planning process. This redevelopment plan provided a clear framework for land use and transportation, including specifying residential areas, mixed use areas, even recommending specific building height limitations, a proposal for a new , interconnected street grid within the 70 acre site and additional parks and open space to add to the Lowry neighborhood in 2011. This The Buckley Annex was vacated by the Air Force and in 2012 the transfer of the property to the LRA was completed. In 2013 we began the city processes for planning the redevelopment of the Buckley Annex and that began with a general development plan that was approved by the city in 2013. I'll be talking a little bit more about that in a bit. This is the analysis and an illustrative of future plans for redevelopment as they stand today for the Buckley Annex. Consistent with the redevelopment plan and the general development plan that have been approved, you can see shaded in the upper left hand corner, a residential area that is the focus of. The first application for rezoning this is 14 acres. Again, the owners are the Lourey Redevelopment Authority. The plan for this area and the intent of the rezoning is for redevelopment into new single family housing. Currently it zoned 010 is does not stand for open space as you might think. We don't know what it stands for. It's an old code zone district that allows a weird mix of uses, which I can tell you a little bit more about, but it didn't really fit with the vision for the redevelopment. So the new zone that this application requests is for as a single unit, a as you daresay in within our urban neighborhood context with waivers and the urban the you assume a zoning is our most our smallest lot and most intensive our single unit zoning in Denver it was drafted reflective of some existing patterns a small lot single families scattered throughout the city of Denver. Waivers are requested to customize our U.S. use own district to fit the vision of the Lowrey redevelopment plan and modify some of the Urban House building form standards in our otherwise standard USDA zoned district. Specifically, the waiver is to make modifications to the Urban House building form, essentially to sub out what's in our Denver zoning code with a more customized urban house building for table. In the application, you have the application as an addendum to each staff report in your packets and the specific and what ultimately will be adopted language for the waivers are in the application. A summary of the waivers is found in the staff report for this application on page six. So in addition to waiving out the Urban House form that's otherwise applicable in our zoning code, we've also done a similar waiver to customize the formed standards for detached accessory structures like the garage in the back. And then finally, the third waiver has to do very specifically with a proposed pattern of development that's more of a courtyard, single family development that faces an internal open space rather than a street. So there was need for a waiver regarding limits on the number of primary structures on the zone lot. Okay. We're actually going to talk through that last waiver, first known as waiver number three. Generally in a single family zoned district on any zone lot in the city of Denver that zoned you as you say, you get one house on one zone lot and that's pretty norm. And that works really well for established neighborhoods in the city of Denver. But what we have here in Lowry is a desire shown in the slide to do some creative site planning still single family, but turning some portion of single family homes to face not a public street, but a neighborhood green or park. So in order to accommodate that that new pattern and bring a bit of diversity to the site, a waiver has been requested to allow a single cell not to contain more than one house. So that's what waiver number three does. It's it's confined very specifically to this new type of pattern. You can't do this if you have a zone that that can, you know, face that doesn't face a common green waivers one and two, which are two the urban house building form and the detached accessory structures are summarized again on page six of the staff report. And here on this slide to boil it down, it essentially allows these homes to be a bit taller and a bit bulkier, sit more shoulder to shoulder and not necessarily step down in height from front to rear, as we have in our more typical urban single unit zone districts like Congress Park or Wash Park, it does allow a more bulkier form. So you'll see the change between the standard USDA standards and the first column of the slide versus what is proposed in the waiver. Shown in the second column, we have an increase in height for the rear third from 17 feet to 35 feet, and essentially allow that two and a half family or two and a half storey building to fill fill the lot, not break from the front two thirds to the rear third nobo claim we have a shallower setback allowance reduced from. 2210. Again, because of this infill condition we have, which is more of a a wide open slate, you're not trying to fit in the House to an existing context. There's a little more flexibility they needed on that primary street setback, which I'll talk about a little bit more rare setback, similarly has been reduced when there is an alley from 12 to 5 feet and building coverage present lot in terms of a maximum has been removed through the waivers again to allow more coverage, less deliberately , less open space, a different style and type of housing that's relatively low maintenance and deemed desirable by certainly some market segments. In Denver, what you get is very similar to what's already been built in Lowry East to Quebec and not too dissimilar from a lot of the single family development in other greenfield communities like Stapleton. Again, changes in waiver number two are to that detached accessory structure. These are typically garages found in the rear the lot here again, we the waivers allow a bulkier, taller, detached accessory structure, noble plane. It can be built essentially to the same height as the main house with a reduced side street setback. Waivers are still enabled by the Denver zoning code. It is an option that can be used in this case. After a lot of deliberation and talks back and forth between the applicant and staff and the counsel office, the applicant chose to go with waivers. We consider it at CPD a bit of a case study in what to do with an infill greenfield site like this, where a more dense form is required without change in the overall single family density. Most areas of change, as this Buckley Annex is designated in Blueprint, Denver typically call for mixed use, high densities. And as I'll talk about further, we didn't really have a zoned district on the books, a standard USDA that fit exactly what the redevelopment plans and the GDP called for. It's interesting to note as a bit of a sidebar and as to why CPD felt comfortable with waivers in this case, is that the code already has built into it a lot of flexibility and provisions to do these same types of modifications to building form, grant a little extra height, play with the ball plane, step up that rear height if it matches an existing context. We have something called a primary block sensitive primary street block sensitive setback where if you're tearing down a house in the middle of a intact block face, you've got essentially match what's already there. And that might end up being less than a 20 foot setback as required in the otherwise uniform standards. And that's perfectly all right to again facilitate context sensitive development. Similarly, the code allows staff to make administrative adjustments again to height in storeys and in feet to allow some flexibility on a case by case basis to someone who wants to build something that, when they look around, looks like everything else and it's neighborhood. But the code, you know, built and drafted at a more higher level didn't get down to that. We knew couldn't get down to that level of context sensitivity, but we enabled it through a procedure. So it's just an interesting sidebar that this is not that new way of approach to thinking of what we do with building form standards in the code. But we need it in this case because there is no existing context. We've got a 70 acre vacant site that's being built. We need to build in that same flexibility and that's why we chose the waivers. One of the reasons we chose the waivers. Every rezoning application goes through a city review. In summary, there were no substantive negative reactions from our sister agencies and departments in the city. The first submittal from the applicant did spark a substantive comment from CPD and that was the first submittal included a request for a waiver to require parking spaces for a single unit development. Right now in the entire Denver zoning code, as it as it exists today and the former Denver zoning code as it existed prior to 2010, Denver has never had a minimum parking requirement in a single family zoned district. So the old are zero one the new RSU. You start at zero and developers build what they what they think is new. Needed. So speed felt strongly there was no no reason to shift that policy in this particular zoning request. And so we provide a comment that this was inconsistent with the intent of the code in our plan recommendations, which sparked a recent middle that remove that waiver. And then CPD offered its support of the application to move forward. This is a summary of the public review just after it went into the city process. I'm sure the applicant can speak more about its own outreach efforts, but the city review process, we get notification out at certain key times when we receive the rezoning application. So in April 2014, when it went to Planning Board Notice again was sent out for Liberty and again now for City Council, there are a number of our nos that have stated an interest in this property and they were all notified throughout at this various points of this application. Moving forward, you have attached to the staff report and in a supplemental package that was delivered tonight, no pilot apologized. We just realized today that was left out of the original packet. All the various emails and written comments that CPD has received. There may be additional public comments that you received directly as city council members that should be in your packets or I'm sorry, sit cya. I want to say serious, but that's the Apple phone approach. CYA as well for the single zone at REZONINGS, we had a pretty fairly unanimous or almost unanimous support. Generally, there was a lot of support for the single unit rezoning applications that you have in front of you, primarily because it does provide more of the same of what we already see in Lowry. There were some opposition. Generally this had to do with that discarded parking waiver with a request to seriously consider putting that back into the application. Of course, every rezoning is held up against review criteria that are stated in the Denver zoning code. There's a bit there's a new one that you don't often see when we have a general development plan preceding rezonings, the city council is authorized to take it into consideration. It's not a shell, but you may take the approved GDP into consideration in reviewing the rezoning applications. The other criteria we're all familiar with our shells. You have to do this. You have to look for consistency with adopted plans, uniformity of district regulations, whether the rezoning furthers the public health, safety and welfare, according to the Denver Zoning Code, whether there are justifying circumstances, and whether the request for the specific zoned district is consistent with the neighborhood context zone, district, purpose and intent. Looking at the GDP again, this is an illustrative of how the GDP invasion, the land use mix and intensity of development throughout the entire 70 acre Berkeley annex. Again, we're just looking at that top left hand corner, the northwest corner closest to Monica home first. But you can see how we have the existing neighborhoods to the north and to the south. And here in this case, the single family development is transitioning from Mayfair to a more intense core within the Berkeley annex that's centered along a newly extended Lowry Boulevard that cuts through the site east to west, providing a new connection in the GDP. This area was designated the First Avenue Residential, and it was described in terms of its future land use plan and intensity as a single unit detached area, maximum building heights of two and a half stories lot sizes, a smallish 3000 square feet with relatively shallow setbacks. That's exactly what the proposed usou a with waivers proposes to provide. You could only do single families the most intense residential you can do under a U.S. way. So it will enable that GDP vision to play out with a mix of single with with single unit detached houses. The height is capped at two and a half storeys. The zone lot sizes match up with the GDP starting at a minimum of 3000. And with the waiver, that more shallow setback of ten feet versus 20 feet is allowed next. Looking at consistency with Adopt a plans blueprint Denver which is our guiding combined land use transportation plan designated this particular sub area an area of change and called out for future land use concept as employment again noting importantly that the plan blueprint Denver was adopted prior to the closure of the Air Force uses and therefore really is of limited applicability in terms of a guiding document. But Blueprint Denver does have a lot to say about areas of change. And so we can look to it for guidance as to what's envisioned generally in an area of change. Again, these are areas where we we as a city, Denver, intends to channel growth. It does call out Lowry as a whole as an area of change and speaks specifically for the potential to create new neighborhoods within its boundary. Transitions between existing areas of stability and and areas of change are very important and stressed in blueprint Denver CPD staff feels that the you as you a requested zoning with waivers does encourage housing development with characteristics of Denver's existing urban neighborhoods, but provides and does provide that transition to the existing single unit, Mayfair and Crest more neighborhoods to the north and east. The waivers allow for development pattern similar to what would be allowed for existing established neighborhoods through other special provision described earlier. And then the future land use employment does but does provide some guidance. Even our planned employment areas speak to the potential for residential to be part of that future land use, calling particularly for special attention to design and buffering between any residential near the employment centers. So other rezoning applications you'll see in the next few months will deal with that Lowry Boulevard corridor and other mixed use areas planned, and we'll really carry for that employment recommendation a little bit more clearly. But as a as the proposed USDA with waivers, it does provide a land use and building high transition between those future planned more intense core areas of mixed employment and residential to single family to the north. Uniformity of district regulations is a review criteria that staff through more detail in the staff report believes is met here. It is a unique zoned district because of the waivers and therefore will be uniform with within itself essentially and that it furthers the public health, safety and welfare through implementation of the city's adopted land use plans and the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. Finally, we look at justifying circumstances and consistency with neighborhood context. What happened to justify in circumstances? Well, let's skip to consistency with neighborhood context, own district purpose and intent. Don't let me forget justifying circumstances though. Anyway, the proposed neighborhood context is urban neighborhood. Urban neighborhoods, as described in the Denver Zoning Code and Article five presumes an existing or planned pattern of fairly rectangular blocks broken up by local streets in a fairly grid pattern to make connections easier. It provides a vision of walkability in the form of detached sidewalks with garages and other vehicle access, typically taken from rear alleys rather than from the street, and with plenty of opportunity for other modes of transportation. Then then the vehicle, the zoned district general purpose that the residential zone districts are intended to accommodate variation of residential development by virtue of the different zone district types within the urban neighborhood context to reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while accommodating reinvestment and then the zone district specific intent. Specifically, the USA. A Zone District does allow and facilitates development on relatively small blocks for Denver, as small as 3000 square feet. This district allows the most shallow setbacks and highest lot coverage within the urban neighborhood. Context. CPD staff believes that the proposed rezoning is consistent with that stated intent. The base U.S. Zone District provides a land use and building form that recognizes common residential characteristics, such as two and a half storeys and a minimum size of 3000 square feet. The proposed waivers allow for shallow front setbacks, higher lot coverage and no bulk plane, which does accommodate a variation in residential development patterns and reinvestment in this part of Denver. These waivers reflect patterns in other established neighborhoods that were built built either pre zoning code or under former chapter 59 under are two or other. Multifamily zoning with waivers and other site planning flexibility that was built in. Accordingly. Oh, and let me just say justifying circumstances, since for some reason my slide didn't pop up there. CBD stuff is as detailed. More specifically in your staff report finds that there are justifying circumstances, namely in the fact of the changed conditions that have occurred with the departure of the Federal Air Force Office complex from this park. 70 acres. That justifies a reconsideration of the old zoning oh one to a new zone district. You issue a with waivers altogether. Then CPD recommends approval of Council Bill 14 522 that would resume property located at approximately 90 Monica Street Parkway from 012 U.S. way with waivers based on finding all review criteria have been met. Well, look at that, right? The next one. I could. I completed my presentation on Council Bill 1405 to 2. Next, we'll move to the staff presentation on Council Bill 1405 to 3, which is for property located at approximately 7000 to 7300 Archer Park Place. Again, we're honing in on the Buckley Annex Council District five, part of the larger Lowrey statistical neighborhood. In this case, we're talking about a relatively small sliver of a little more than four acres in the southeast corner of the Buckley Annex. Again, just a portion of the entire 70 acres. Um, here we we abut Lowry Southwest, which is part of the Lowry development. Single family homes on larger lots. We also about a portion of an existing older multifamily townhome and taller apartment building complex called Park Heights. And there you have some pictures of those adjacencies. And then across Qu\u00e9bec Street, an existing Lowry neighborhood of single family homes facing Quebec. Again, this is a picture from the general development plan showing that area highlighted in yellow. Property owners, again, as the Lowry Redevelopment Authority here. The intent with this rezoning is to redevelop into new single family, and specifically a rezoning from former Chapter 59 Orchard Zoning of oh one to Urban Neighborhood Context Single Unit B with waiver. So you as you be with waivers here, the waivers are somewhat similar to the waivers we discussed with the previous council bill were with the U.S. you'll be starting as the base. We're at a slightly larger minimum zone, lot of 4500 square feet rather than 3000 square feet. The waivers are similar, though, to the Urban House form and to the detached accessory structure form. Again, primarily to allow a bulkier, taller structure, very similar to what already exist and what is built out to the south and east in the existing Lowry, the Lowry neighborhood. So again, we see a bump up in height. We see the departure from a break in height from front to rear and no bulk claim. We see a shallower setback of ten feet. We have a smaller rear setback when there is an alley. And when there is no alley, though, it's still the same. And we we leave the building coverage behind with the waivers on the detached accessory structure. Again, these are typically rear garages or other similar secondary buildings. On the site. We go taller from 1 to 2 stories and 17 feet to 35 feet. No bulk lane and a shallower street setback. Waivers are enabled by section 12 .4. 10.6 of the Denver zoning code. Again, we're looking at a fairly unique circumstance presented here, where we have a planned area of change where we intend to channel growth, but with a clear cap on density of of of no greater than what single unit zoning would allow. So if need needed to customize the zoning with the waivers again reminiscent of other tools we have in our current arsenal zoning codes but wouldn't apply here because it's not technically infill development. So we're getting to a similar end that we allow a property owner that's rebuilding in the middle of an existing neighborhood, the same degree of flexibility through the waivers to this new 70 acre redevelopment that doesn't have existing neighborhoods on the same blocks. Again, City Review has occurred and all other sister agencies have approved with no comments or no substantive comments on the proposed rezoning. And we had a first submittal from the applicant with a proposed parking waiver to require a minimum amount of parking spaces for single unit development. Again, in its first round, CPD recommended the removal of that request for waiver is contrary to the intent of the code and the parking policy of the city as exists and the remainder of the code and other issue districts not to require minimum parking for single unit development. Subsequently, that proposed waiver was dropped and what you see before you does not include that waiver notifications were sent according to code when we received the rezoning application prior to. Planning Board again prior to committee and again prior to this public hearing. Again, we received a lot of public input in the form of written emails and letters which you have before you in your packets, primarily all in support of the proposed use and zoning with waivers. A couple of other opposition comments, again requesting that that minimum parking waiver be added back to the application that went or before you today review criteria again because there is a predecessor GDP. Council is authorized to give consideration to that GDP. And in weighing this rezoning and its appropriateness, also our standard rezoning criteria are in play. You need to find that this application is consistent with adopted plans will result result in uniformity of district regulations and will further the public health, safety and welfare. You'll need to find that there are justifying circumstances for considering a rezoning of this property from its current oh one zone, and that the proposed USA bee with waivers is consistent with the neighborhood urban neighborhood context zone, district purpose and intent statements. Again, we look to the GDP for advice and guidance. The yellow shaded portion in the bottom right hand corner of this illustrative future development plan that's consistent with the GDP shows this corner to be plan for single unit development. There is no street between the rear of these homes and the adjoining Lowry homes, so these do not have a rear alley, but they do face a public street. That's Arch Archer Place. The GDP specifically called out this area as the Community Park South Residential Sub area and called out for this being single unit detached residential with a height of no more than two and a half stories. Staff finds that in considering the GDP, this proposed rezoning is consistent with the sub area intent language. The USPI with waivers will provide land use of single unit detached housing and a height maximum of two and a half storeys. Huh? What happened to my. Can I have a moment just to unhide some slide?\nSpeaker 4: So go ahead.\nSpeaker 5: Sorry I got in at 430 today, so I didn't have a chance to.\nSpeaker 4: You know, this.\nSpeaker 5: Quality control tech. And they would love for me to go through this much faster. But because it's a separate application, I have to go through each of these criteria again so that it can stand on its own post action by the City Council. So please bear with me. Okay. I think we're back on course. Okay. So again, we're now looking at criteria for your that you need to hold this proposed rezoning up to. The first one is consistency with adaptive plans. We look first to comprehensive plan 2000, which has a number of strategies and objectives relating to infill development and the potential for new housing in the city that offers quality infill development consistent with the character of any existing nearby surrounding neighborhoods. We look to strategies that talk about extending the street grid into blocks of land that don't have it, which the GDP definitely envisions for this area and providing that interconnectivity. Modifying land use regulations where necessary to ensure the flexibility to accommodate changing demographics and lifestyle choices. That's something that we can do through a rezoning application as well. So the proposed rezoning, Steph feels, is consistent with a comprehensive plan, recommendations and strategies. The rezoning to an urban neighborhood context type of zoned district reinforces the street pattern and goals of current Plan 2000, which has rear alleys as its primary vehicle access. The waivers which allow more gross floor area. Essentially you get a bigger house on the same site, a bigger amount of floor area in a house on the same size zoned as a zone. Lot does allow and accommodate differing lifestyle choices to live in the city of Denver, but perhaps have as much square footage as you might find outside the city. The Lowry reuse plan, which was re adopted in 2000, again is of limited applicability here because it didn't anticipate the change in use from the Federal Air Force Use Blueprint. Denver oops showing the wrong area. But again, remember, we're down in the lower right hand corner. This is an area of change. The land use concept, again, is that future employment, which was based on the announcement of the closure of this portion of Lowry. But we look to blueprint Denver for very good guidance on what's supposed to happen in our areas of change. We look to channel growth there. We have specific goals for Lowry as an area of change where it's this particular redevelopment is seen as an opportunity to create new neighborhoods and offer more choices. Addressing transitions between existing, stable neighborhoods and areas of change as a major theme in Blueprint Denver New development redevelopment should be sensitive to those edges. Staff feels that the UCB with waivers, encourages housing development that are consistent with existing traditional neighborhood development. It provides those transitions to the south and east, in this case, to existing Lowry neighborhoods. The waivers allow for a development pattern similar to what would be allowed for existing neighborhoods, both in Lowry and outside Lowry. Through special provisions described earlier. And then in terms of the future land use recommendation of employment blueprint, Denver, while describing employment as being in primarily job based, does envision a mix of residential uses within that future land use category, calling out the need for special attention to transition between those employment areas and residential. You'll see future rezoning applications for that inner core of Lowry along Lowry Boulevard that will hone in on those more mixed use and employment areas within the Buckley Annex. But the USPI with waivers provides a land use and building height transition from those established neighborhoods to the south and east towards that more planned intensive core of the Buckley Annex. Other criteria uniformity of district regulations. Because the proposed zoning you should be with waivers. It is a unique customized zone to strike, so it will be uniform in terms of the application of the district regulations within the area that it's mapped. Staff recommends finding that this will further the public health, safety and welfare because it does implement the city's adopted land use plans and more specifically, the implements the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. Finally, justifying circumstances. Rezonings may be justified when it's found that the land or its surrounding environment has changed or is changing to such a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage redevelopment the area or to recognize that change character. So again, we have the closure of the Air Force facilities at Buckley Annex in 2011 and its subsequent sale to Lowry Redevelopment Authority in 2012, and numerous planning recommendations for coverage in redevelopment to meet citywide planning goals for areas of change . That's a significant change in what this land has been. It's no longer office. Federal employees are no longer there, which justifies considering a change in its zoning. Finally, we look at consistency of the proposed USPI with waivers with the YOU part of this own district, the urban neighborhood context. Again, our code describes these urban neighborhoods as characterized by single unit and two unit. Residential uses. A regular pattern of rectilinear rectangular block shapes the tight sidewalks and the presence of alleys. Residential buildings have consistent orientation and setbacks, and there's a balance of modes enabled that can get people into it and through it by bike walking or car. We look to the general purpose statement of the Urban Neighborhood Residential Zones and see that they are intended to recognize common residential characteristics but accommodate some variation, reinforce desire development patterns in existing neighborhoods, while again looking forward to reinvestment and providing standards for two and a half storey urban house forms. Specifically, the U.S. B Zone District intent is to allow detached single family homes until not 4500 square feet or larger. And this district does allow relatively shallow separates and higher lock coverages than some of our other U.S. zone districts that require a larger lots staff that signs and recommends. You find that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the above intent, language and context description. The base U. SUV Zone District provides a land use and building form that recognizes common residential characteristics, such as two and a half storeys and a minimum lot size of 4500 square feet. The proposed waivers allow for those shallow but consistent front setbacks, high walk coverage and no bulk plan, which accommodates variation and reinvestment in this part of Denver to accommodate growing and changing needs and demands for housing in Denver. With that, based on this presentation and the staff report in front of you, CPD recommends approval of Council Bill 1405 to 4 seeking a change in zoning of the property noted from 012g ups that should be you as should be with waivers based on finally finding our review criteria have been met. I'm really tired of hearing myself talk. I'm sure they're hanging in there.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, we're loving it.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Thank you.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. On the edge of our seats. Just.\nSpeaker 5: Okay. Next before you. Is application Councilor Bell 14 dash 052 for seeking a rezoning of property within the Buckley Annex, located at approximately 7000 to 7300 Archer Place. This is seeking a rezoning from the existing Denver zoning up from Mr.. Say that over again seeking a rezoning from oh one to grh3 with waivers. The grade three stands for General Urban Neighborhood Context, a different neighborhood context than what we've been talking about so far tonight. Our H has road home again, a different building form and intensity than what we've talked about earlier with a maximum height of three stories, but again customized to further implement the GDP and adaptive the plans by the addition of two waivers to get your bearings once more, we're zooming in on the Buckley Annex in Council District five. Now you see the yellow highlighted portion is more of the central area within the 70 acres no longer really abutting existing single family were either surrounded by a proposed single unit development within the Buckley Annex as described in the earlier two applications or by proposed employment mixed use areas or existing multi-unit, high rise and townhome development to the south. Am I missing some key facts? So summarize for you. This is again approximately 15 acres. The owner is the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. It did take ownership through the transfer. So all you need to know, we have the same history of the Berkeley Annex itself through its previous life as an air reserve personnel center with some 3000 employees through the reuse plans adopted by the city updated in 2000 by Denver's Comp Plan Blueprint Denver in 2002. With the change in conditions being the 2005 Department of Defense announcement that it was closing the Buckley Annex and the 2008 completion of a Buckley Annex redevelopment plan by the Redevelopment Authority. This is a plan that was not adopted by the city, but was followed up closely after the property was vacated and transferred by the 2013 General Development Plan, which was approved by the city. Now we're talking about an area, again, fairly internal to the 70 acre Buckley Annex site. This illustrative plan is is consistent with the general development plan that now calls for this area to be a mix of no longer single unit but row home and single family attached housing. The current zoning is one. This allows a variety of civic and public uses like jails and schools, but doesn't allow the type of residential the the plans call for and very limited commercial the grade three with waivers. Again this is a general urban neighbor context different than the urban neighborhood context with the introduction of multi-unit housing and development potential, but specifically a form of of housing that multi-unit dwellings that's a real home form. So more attached units vertically attached to each other rather than stacked row house requires each dwelling unit to have a ground storey street facing entrance. In this case, the waivers are to each of the building forms allowed in the otherwise standard. You are a three and I'll summarize this briefly in a minute. And again, there are building form waivers for the primary building and then again for detached accessory accessory structures. Here we have a summary from the staff report that shows the difference from the base grade three to what is being proposed with the waivers. The theme is familiar. We're seeking a slightly boxier, bulkier form of row homes, no longer a break in height from front to back, as we might see in a general urban neighborhood like Capitol Hill, which is a more infill, contextual requirement, which goes from 30 feet to 40 feet with the waivers across the entire depth of the zone lot, no sidewall height maximum. We get a shallower setback with the waivers at ten feet and a shallower rear setback when there is an alley of five feet. Those are the changes sought in the waivers to the Rowhouse building form. In addition, there are waivers that seek changes to the urban house and duplex building forms. Should a single unit or two unit homes structures be built within this area, similar to what we saw with previous applications? The waivers enable taller bulkier structure, no break in height from front to rear. You get the same 35 feet across the entire zone lot. No sidewall height marks a shallower primary street setback of ten feet allowed a shallower rear setback when there is an alley and no building coverage. The third waivers deal with detached accessory structures such as garage and the rear of a lot. Here again, we see a request through the waivers for a bulkier form and taller form of two stories and 35 feet, essentially no taller than the main house or building on the lot. Waivers are enabled by Section 12, 14 and six of the Denver Zoning Code. Again, CPD has viewed this application as a case study within a larger effort that needs to be undertaken to understand where else in the city we might have designated either currently or future areas of change combined with lower intensity land land use recommendations such as attached single family. Most areas have changed our plan for some type of mixed use development, and so the zoning recommended typically as a mixed use zoned district and that we've had plenty of success with implementing our plans in areas of change through mixed use zoning here was a unique circumstance where we have an area of change that a recommendation for lower intensity of residential, hence the need to modify and build in some flexibility with the waivers. Again, noting that this is allowed through other means in the Denver zoning code. When you're in an infill position within an existing fabric, we allow variations in the front setback to go shallower than what's otherwise required or to bulk up or go taller when it's consistent with other existing buildings around it here, because there's no existing pattern that you're building and slotting into. But the result would be similar. We needed a new tool and new way to get there. Hence the waivers that allow that bulkiness and height in as in a row home zone district. This has gone through a full city review. All our sister agencies listed have approved it with no substantive comments. CPD did have assessment and comment in the first round after the initial submittal of the application did include a park parking waiver that would have increased the required minimum parking for multi-unit dwelling use from 1 to 2 parking spaces per dwelling unit. CPD looked at our other general urban zone districts and saw the intent to carry through the rest of the code, which for this type of urban neighborhood did not require a minimum of two. And so asked that this waiver be removed to remain consistent with the parking policies embedded in the rest of the code. The applicant did resubmit and eliminated the parking waiver from the application. Public review was primarily through the form of public notifications. Initially at the very onset when we receive a complete application, notice is sent by email to all RINO's and to all affected city council offices. Property was posted and notice sent before the Planning Board Ludie and again tonight before the City Council public hearing. There are a number of renos at issue here. They were they've all been notified in this case for this application. We received a lot more public input in opposition to the proposed rezoning than in support, you'll see. And in the packets in front of you, we've got about 13 emails and letters in support, just as is in the application you have in front of you tonight. But we had numerous 54 at last count letters, emails of opposition primarily boiling down to that minimum parking requirement. Those in opposition were not. I look through them again tonight. I didn't see any opposition necessarily, you know, taken as a whole to the idea of row homes or multi-family uses. According to plan, it was a parking minimum firing from that standard grade three zone district of one parking space per unit. All those who oppose would prefer that that parking minimum be raised to two parking spaces out of a concern for overflow and impacts, perhaps on surrounding neighborhoods from overflow parking demand both of residents get. US within proposed the planned multi-unit development. You'll see here. Recap in more detail some of the themes that we read about and saw in those letters of opposition. Again, we look to the review criteria and the Denver zoning code to guide this rezoning through council. The first is that the City Council may approve an official rezoning application that's located within an approved general development plan, taking into consideration the objectives and recommendations of the approved GDP. What you have in front of you is a graphic illustration of the general development plan. This portion is highlighted in the Orange is the central residential portion of the GDP. It's identified as the Rowhouse Boulevard sub area. It straddles the proposed extension of Lowry Boulevard and calls specifically not just for multi-unit, but single family attached multi-unit. So it got to the type of building form as well as the level of intensity proposed for this area. Maximum height of three stories, pedestrian entrances facing Lowry Boulevard as a primary street. So fairly specific guidance in the GDP. Staff feels that with this guidance, the G RH three with the waivers was a good fit to implement the GDP recommendations. That Zone District provides a land use for multi-unit form standards for a rowhouse urban form with those pedestrian entrances required for each dwelling unit facing Lowry Boulevard or other primary streets and a height maximum of three stories. Next, we look at consistency with adopted plans, with comprehensive plan 2000, we find strategies and objectives called out here, more detail that seek to promote infill development, that encourage development of housing that meets increasingly diverse needs of of different populations and new residents and older residents like. We see strategies that seek to encourage quality infill development consistent with the character of surrounding neighborhoods, and that looks to extend the prevailing street grid and interconnected parkways and detached sidewalks. And Trayvon's in our urban neighborhoods, where that is the existing pattern and strategies that acknowledge that our land use regulations might need to be modified in some cases to ensure flexibility to accommodate these planned demand are changing demographics and lifestyles. Staff finds the proposed rezoning with the general urban neighborhood context. RH three reinforces the desired street pattern goals of the comp plan 2000 and will enable residential housing types that meet changing needs of Denver's present and future residents. We look to other adopted plan specifically than the Lowry reuse plan. But again, because this plan, even as adopted in 2000, did not foresee the vacancy of the federal government from that site is of limited applicability. We look to blueprint Denver again. I'm sorry, it's showing the wrong hash yellow, but the application in front of you is correct and the area is that central area plan for single unit in Blueprint Denver. It's designated an area of change and a future employment land use. Again, the plan was adopted. Blueprint Denver Plan was adopted prior to the closure the Air Force uses. That element of employment is is somewhat of limited applicability but we still gain some guidance certainly. Blueprint Denver speaks to objectives for areas of change of which this rezoning application falls within. These are areas in Denver where we seek to channel growth there. Lowry has called out specifically in Blueprint Denver as a place where the potential to create new neighborhoods is of utmost opportunity there. Addressing transitions between areas of stability and areas of change is a consistent theme in Blueprint Denver and staff fires that the proposed you are H-3 with waivers. Rezoning is consistent with blueprint goals for areas of change and creates the potential to create a new neighborhood that includes characteristics of Denver's traditional urban general or general urban neighborhoods that we see elsewhere in the city. As to the future land use recommendation of employment in Blueprint Denver, the land use concept does describe a need for special attention to design, screening and buffering when those employment land uses include residential areas or uses. Again, staff finds that the the proposed RH three with waivers rezoning. Does provide that special attention to design and specifically those building form standards by providing a land use and building height transition between those more intense to future planned employment and mixed use areas and more single family both within the Buckley Annex plan planning area and outside the boundaries. And therefore this criteria has met. SAP also finds that the proposed zoning of grades three fulfills the criteria that that Zone District B results in uniformity of district regulations. This is a unique zone district tailored to implement those adopted plans because it will be applied right now, at least only to this Buckley Annex area. Its staff finds that the regulations would be uniform within the district itself. Staff also recommends a finding that this rezoning will further the public health, safety and welfare, primarily through the implementation of the city's adopted plans. The Area of Change Recommendations and Blueprint. Denver and the Buckley Annex General Development Plan. Next, we look to whether the rezoning fulfills the review criteria that there are justifying circumstances. Rezonings may be justified when the land or its surrounding environs has changed or is changing to such a degree that it's in the public interest to encourage a redevelopment of the area or to recognize the change character area through a rezoning. Well, certainly the closure of the Air Force facilities at Buckley Annex in 2011 and the ultimate sale to Lowry Redevelopment Authority was a substantial change in circumstances in regard to the future redevelopment and reduce potential this property. We have plans adopted that recommend redevelopment of this parcel and therefore we feel the rezoning is justified through this change in circumstances. Finally, we look to consistent whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with the general urban neighborhood context, description and the specific purpose and intent statement for the RH three zoned district's general urban neighborhood. Context, as described in the Denver Zoning Code, is characterized by multi-unit. Residential uses, a regular pattern of rectangular block shapes, detached sidewalks, presence of alleys and vehicle access from alleys, consistent building orientation and setbacks from those primary streets, and a pattern that enables a balancing of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle reliance with greater access to other modes of transportation. The zoned district general purpose for the G RH family of zone districts is to promote and protect higher density residential neighborhoods, reinforce desired development patterns in existing neighborhoods while creating standards for new neighborhoods. Provide standards for buildings to orient to the street, take access formally, and have high lock coverage in shallow front yards. And then specifically, the grade three is intended to allow for a mix of building forms and uses accommodated through the urban house, duplex and row house building forms, including uses from single unit to unit to multi-unit to not taller than three stories here staff finds that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the above intent language. The base g three zone district provides a land use and building form that promotes the higher density seen typically in general urban neighborhoods and in row home zone districts. The proposed waivers allow for a shallower front setbacks, high lock coverage and higher sidewall height, while which accommodates for a new neighborhood within a designated area of change. Additionally, the requested zoning implements the neighborhood context vision for grid streets, blocks, alleys and sidewalks and therefore implements the Buckley and external development plan is consistent with those objectives as well. Taken All Together is more detailed in the staff report. CPD recommends approval of Council Bill 1405 to 3, which would change the zoning of property located at approximately 7000 Archer Place from oh one. That's wrong to you two g rh three with waivers. Just ignore the rest of those words. I'll finish you on the.\nSpeaker 2: Last two flip. I notice that grade dropped into 310. Okay. All right. Let me like that. We have six speakers for it, for the three combined, and I'm going to say all six names. You can come up to the front pew. Bob Golic, Marty Forest. Kevin. Yoshida, Greg Kerwin and Brian Word and David Smith. So you all can come up to the front pew and Mr. Golic, you can come on up and begin your remarks.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council. I feel like I need to take a deep breath for Tina. My name is Bob Garlic. My address at 609 South Gaylord Street in Denver. I'm here this evening on behalf of Laurie Economic Redevelopment Authority. I will combine all my comments for all three of these proposed bills. Council Bill 522, five, 23 and 524 of the Boulevard one property is relatively small in comparison to the rest of Lowry, but it's a very significant parcel. It's it's the last large parcel that's under Lowry control. As Tina mentioned, all of the Boulevard one property is classified in blue for Denver as an area of change. And there have been significant changes over the past few years to the site. Probably the most significant is that in 2012, the United States Air Force turned this property over to the control of the Lowry Redevelopment Authority. Prior to that, it was controlled by the United States Air Force. So upon that transaction, Lowry entered into the general development or GDP process, getting an approval in front of the Denver Planning Board in 2013, which is another very significant change conditioned now that approved general development plan establish sub areas throughout all of boulevard one in the evening. You're looking at three of those sub areas. You're looking at the First Avenue residential, which is single family, and that is the northern parcels that Tina described. You're looking at Community Park South, which is also single family, and that's the southern part that Tina described. And then Rowhouse Boulevard, which is the attached townhouse project or product, and that's in the center of those two, combining those two other sub areas. All of these are in conformance with the approved general development plan. We feel that we have the appropriate zoning that we're proposing this evening. The proposed Usou A and U suburb are both single family districts. They simply have a different minimum lot size. The USDA requires 3000 square feet while the US sub requires 4500 square feet. Otherwise they're almost identical. And the grade three, which is the Rowhouse Boulevard site, it permits identical uses in the general development plan with a maximum height of three stories, which is again what the general development plan recommends. This proposed map amendment, if approved, will bring the zoning in the complete conformance with the general development plan. It will become the catalyst for development in these three sub areas. We're proposing nothing outside the approved land use or guidelines in that general development plan. And as Tina went into detail on, there are a handful of waivers in these three zoning applications. The reason being in 2010, when the zoning code was updated, we lost the ability to use plan building groups or PBDEs. And that necessitates these some of these waivers. We were allowed to have multiple structures on his own lot at that time, no interior setbacks. And so not being able to utilize plan building groups necessitates these waivers. I will be here to answer any questions you may have as the rest of our development team will as well. Thank you for your time.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Garlic Monte Force.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening, Mr. President. Members of council, I'm Monte Faust. I'm the executive director for the Lowry Redevelopment Authority and we are the master developer for Lowry. Address is 7290 East First Avenue, and I'll be speaking to all three of these bills as well. 522, five, 23 and 524. I commend Tina on a great presentation on these details, even though she came in at the last minute. And so I'm going to be brief, but I'd like to amplify or emphasize a couple of points that were made earlier. First, we are very happy to be here finally. It's been a long road to get to this point. We've been through an exhaustive, inclusive public process that started in 2007. We have had well over 60 public meetings with robust debate with all the stake holders that we have to gather input to hear their concerns and finally to reach some compromises. The result is what I feel is a very balanced plan that recognizes the surrounding context but still has a broader view to the community needs. Secondly, Boulevard one, you've been hearing Buckley antics all night, but Boulevard one is what we call it now, as part of Lowry, is the last development parcel of Lowry. It consists of 70 acres out of a total of 866 acres of Lowry. It was the site of the former Defense Finance and Accounting Service Center that vacated the site in 2011. The overall boulevard one plan actually calls for 800 residential units consisting of about 450 apartments, 120 single family detached, 230 single family attached. In addition, we have up to 200,000 square feet of commercial in the form of office, retail, restaurants, neighborhood services. And there's also about 13 acres or 19% of the site that is dedicated to open space. What we're seeking tonight is the approval for the zoning for the first phase of this development. About half of this site that will have about 250 residential units on it. There's not any commercial development or apartments in this first phase. Thirdly, as was noted by staff, we're asking for waivers to the zoning as this request is because we have narrowly tailored and crafted the zoning is to match the plan that we had negotiated with our neighbors and in which in turn large part replicates development partners that are already established at Lowry. The tools that, as Bob said, the tools that were previously available to us in the old code such as PGS are no longer available. So we saw that the least impactful approach to accomplish the same end result. Finally, with respect to parking that you've heard about, we have added parking standards into our design review process so that we weren't didn't have to have it in the zoning applications themselves. That concludes my comments and I ask for your support in these rezonings and I'm available answering your questions. You might have. Thanks.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Kevin Yoshida.\nSpeaker 4: My name is Kevin Yoshida. My address is 8025 West Colfax. I'm the architecture and planning consultant for the Library Redevelopment Authority and member of the Lowry Design Review Committee and available to answer any questions you have.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Greg Kerwin.\nSpeaker 0: Good evening. I live in the crust. More district in the crust, more neighborhood in District five, which will be directly harmed by the overdevelopment of Buckley Annex. I speak in opposition to the three current zoning proposals which restore the use of zoning waivers, a tool that the city had decided not to use with the 2010 zoning code . In addition, the third proposal for row houses continues to ignore neighborhood requests for adequate parking. First on waivers, the three zoning proposals set a dangerous precedent for this council. Instead of using existing zoning categories in the 2010 code, CPD and the developer are back to using customized zoning by proposing waivers from standard zoning categories. CPD says this is a test case, but it is going down a slippery slope or asking the council to do so by reintroducing waivers to the Denver zoning process. Neighborhoods around Buckley Annex are concerned about density, traffic and parking in an area that is not a transit oriented development. Buckley Annex is miles from light rail. It has infrequent bus service. It's an area where surrounding intersections on Quebec, Monaco and Alameda are gridlocked. The LRA has been refusing for years to listen to and address neighborhood concerns. Instead, it is moving forward with its plans for a high density, high traffic development with minimal parking. In contrast, I note Councilwoman Robb has set an excellent example of how the zoning process could work with her recently completed legislative rezoning of Cherry Creek North. After a bitter, contentious meeting with this council over Cherry Creek North in 2012, with the help of a mediator, a consensus has been reached in Cherry Creek North. Instead of allowing that kind of process here, instead you have an ad hoc, customized zoning proposal that brings back the tool of waivers. If you allow waivers, you should expect developers to request waivers on many future zoning requests. Second on parking. Editorial writers for both The Denver Post and the Denver Business Journal have commented on Councilwoman Sussman recent article that Denver does not have a mandate from voters to minimize car spick car parking spaces. There's no light rail service to this property, and the existing infrequent bus service will not allow people to live in these new buildings without cars. It is not in the interest of Denver residents to provide inadequate minimum parking at a new development like this. One is only serves to advance the interest of developers because it will cost them less while providing inadequate parking. The excess parking will spill over to and burden adjacent neighborhoods. Please restore the condition that was dropped and call for two parking spaces per residential unit. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Brian Ward.\nSpeaker 4: Good evening. I'm Brian Wert. I had resided to 50 Eudora Street in Denver, and I want to mention that there were some other speakers here who have had to leave. So I made hopefully you appreciate small numbers. I currently chair Larry's Community Advisory Committee, or CAC, as we know, and and I have been a member of the CSC since its inception in 1994. I mostly want to verify for you the intensity of the public process surround Berkeley Annex and Boulevard One, and I think that's primarily related to the fact that there are many more residents now at Lowry than there were in previous planning efforts on Lowry land. There are far more people who are interested in what's going on at Berkeley Annex, and they participated in the numerous meetings and many mentioned. The result of that participation is that nearly all, if not all, of the changes that the involved neighbors wanted in the reuse plan and in the GDP and now in reflected in the zoning applications before you are incorporated and those in those various documents. So with that, I just want to encourage your approval of these applications. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. And our last speaker is David Smith.\nSpeaker 8: Thank you. Counsel. Thank you, President. I am David Smith. I live at 7135 East Bay. I'd avenue my backyard abuts the Buckley Annex. There's no alleyway there. We will have a house or homes right behind us. I speak in qualified support of the amendments. If this is the best that we can do, then this is what we need. We have a an existing neighborhood in Park Heights that will be affected by this. It is a lot of density going into a low density neighborhood. I've lived all around the city from the west side to the north side, all around here. This is a special neighborhood. So if this is how we're going to do it, I speak in support of this. I'm very proud that we have VHA going in there and the developer listened to us about where DACA would go. I'm proud of what's what's proposed, but there are many concerns about this neighborhood. And if you could, as this moves along, please take a look at it. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Smith. That concludes our speakers. So it's now time for questions from members of council. I just remind council members that the question period is for all three council bills five, 22, five, 23 and 524. So we're going to start with Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. President. I'm going to start in the details I noticed in some of the letters that were in front of us tonight or emails and in some comments that traffic is an issue. Jay Breeze, in his email or letter to the Planning Board, talked about a traffic study and projected new traffic. And I wondered if anyone here could address whether a traffic study was done, maybe during the GDP and if that was a net increase in traffic over what was generated from the former finance center or.\nSpeaker 0: What shapers could not be here tonight. The traffic study that the LRA did noted additional trips of approximately 9000 to 10000 trips per day. As to whether that's a net, the LRA justifies it because they say commuters at Buckley Annex were commuting there before to work at the Finance Center. But when the Finance Center was there, the rest of the surrounding homes at Lowry were not.\nSpeaker 4: So what we're seeing now is immense.\nSpeaker 0: Traffic, because Lowry's been built up and the finance centers shut down.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Mr. Borst, did you want to comment, please?\nSpeaker 0: We did a traffic study as part of the GDP process. Indeed, it demonstrated I forgot the number of exactly 9500 trips, I think, that were generated by the new development of this site. But prior to this development on this site, it was also occupied by 3000 employees in a 600,000 square foot building that generated approximately the same amount of traffic.\nSpeaker 1: I know we're facing similar issues at eighth in Colorado, at ninth in Colorado. My other question is about the density point. I think the parking's been covered, but the density point, I understand that these are single family home and row homes, although Cherry Creek was alluded to tonight as a model, which delights me. We are not talking about single family homes when we talk about density in Cherry Creek. So I'm just wondering if you have a density per acre. That's another figure I'm familiar with. A lot of the R two is about 12 units per acre. And I just was curious.\nSpeaker 0: It's in the neighborhood of 11 units to the acre net.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So that's Cherry Creek North, for example.\nSpeaker 0: The Lowry Town Centers approximately the same density.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. All righty. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilwoman Robb. Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: So I have several questions. So, Mr. first you went through a number of the units that are proposed on the overall 70 acres. And I noticed if somebody could pull up one of the map showing the full site to you, if you wouldn't mind just pulling up one of those maps. So it looks like there's one area that is not being changed, but three of them are correct.\nSpeaker 0: What we have before you tonight are three zoning for about half of the site. So the area to the along first Avenue from Monaco east to Hodiak or Oneida, Oneida and south all the way to. Can you point with that? You can't see it on there. So the first rezoning covers the northern portion of the site. The second rezoning this U.S., a Yusufiyah, rather, is along the adjacency to Park Heights neighborhood on the South Side. And where it's highlighted there in the middle is the Grange three. What's not in the zoning application are the two dumbbells to this development that is on the Lowry Boulevard at Monaco and Lowry Boulevard at Quebec. Are not part of the zoning for you tonight.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. So the 800 acres you spoke about, you said there would be 450 apartments. So that would be at the the rowhouse site.\nSpeaker 0: The 450 apartments would be composed in two areas, one on the south side of Lowry Boulevard, adjacent to Quebec Street, and a future parcel along the southern boundary. That's another 80 units or so between the two of them.\nSpeaker 6: So 400. So the other which you just spoke about that the pieces that part of one of these three sites. Okay. So those numbers are a little confusing. So I'd like to have you give me an idea of how many proposed units for each of the three applicant applications. That would help me to visualize.\nSpeaker 0: The applications tonight. The applications tonight are about 250 units because we don't have final planning.\nSpeaker 6: Can you break them down personally?\nSpeaker 0: And then so the first area that Usou a I believe is around 80 units. Okay. The U.S. B, U.S. B is in the neighborhood of 20 units and the RH three would be the balance. So 150 units. But we don't have detailed planning on all of these areas. But that's a rough number.\nSpeaker 6: Got it. Got it. So can you speak to the affordability of the units? I know you made some about VHA, but that's not part of these three applicants, so.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Lowry has delivered to the market at this point about 1000 affordable units between for sale and apartments. This apartment or this development will have approximately 80 affordable units as part of the development that we're partnering with.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. If I may, I have a couple more. Unless you have other people that want to ask, go it. Okay. So is there a proposed developer for the project at this point or you're trying to get through this first and then we can market it?\nSpeaker 0: Where's the master developer? So we do all of the horizontal development and then we sell to the vertical developers. We have at this point selected our first seven single family detached builders. We're in negotiations with attached builders and with apartment builders.\nSpeaker 6: So there won't be one builder for a particular site. You're looking at different builders that work.\nSpeaker 0: For the multiple builders on site.\nSpeaker 6: And then can you address how the planning board addressed the requests from the neighbors asking for the two units to parking spaces per unit on the Je RH three applet application?\nSpeaker 5: I'm going to have to look back at the staff report because I.\nSpeaker 6: Think they're what you do while you're doing that. I have one other question. Okay. So this would be back for you, Mr.. First, if there were two parking spaces per unit on the Rowhouse section, so area, how would that change the proposed number of units that you're recommending for this?\nSpeaker 0: It wouldn't. We are planning what we are doing and lacking. The neighbors are very concerned about parking, as you've heard. So we initially put parking conditions or waivers into the applications to more mimic the old code for parking requirements, because the new code lowered the standards. When that was rejected as an option, we included parking requirements into our design guideline process so that the road homes will have two parking spaces per unit as well as the single family detached.\nSpeaker 6: Who manages the design guideline process. Is that done by Lowry?\nSpeaker 0: It is done by the Redevelopment Authority, as we have for the past. Not in parking, but all of the design review is handled by the Lowry Design Review Committee.\nSpeaker 6: Is there a reason you would not have it in the in the rezoning application, since you're recommending that the two parking spaces per unit are going to be handled by your design review process? Is there a reason why it would not just be part of the reason application.\nSpeaker 0: We included in it originally, but at the request of staff? We removed it from the application.\nSpeaker 6: And I saw in here somebody thought that staff wouldn't support it if it was left in there. And I don't know what that's about.\nSpeaker 5: That's true. And to respond to your previous question about what planning board did, they did hear testimony similar to what you heard, and they had all the same written testimony that you have in front of you. They declined to add any conditions to their recommendation of approval, which was unanimous. They declined to add any condition, suggesting additional parking be required for the grade three application.\nSpeaker 6: And that was with the understanding that LRT was going to include that in the design review.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. They heard the same testimony. Yes.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I think those are all the questions I have for right now. Thank you.\nSpeaker 2: Councilwoman Ortega, Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 1: Tina, I do have some other questions. I just want to make something pretty clear. In an area of change, you usually look for density, don't you?\nSpeaker 7: That's been the case to date until now.\nSpeaker 5: Most of our area of change that you can all visualize, that blueprint, every map that you have on the wall of all your offices. They're typically along fairly heavily infrastructure, transportation corridors around station areas. In our larger master planned areas like Gateway and Stapleton.\nSpeaker 1: That's all right. That's all I need. I wait. I'm not finished. So what you have here is a developer and neighborhood who did not want density. And so you had to make waivers in order to make this less dense. Then blueprint Denver would have suggested right.\nSpeaker 5: As most other recommended areas of change have gone, and even the rest of Lowry was zoned into a multifamily zone district that allowed a lot, much more intensity than what was ultimately built. And that zoning still exist east of Quebec.\nSpeaker 1: So so actually the waivers were done at the behest of a community that wanted it to be less dense. And we're talking here about 230 single family detached homes. And what about 100 of the rooftops?\nSpeaker 0: It's about 100 and I'm sorry, about 120 detached and about 230 attached.\nSpeaker 1: Attached. All right. So these are all single family homes.\nSpeaker 5: Yes. I mean, we could have pulled back and rezone the whole thing mixed use. Right. And then let the master.\nSpeaker 1: Go first, which is what we did. And this was in response to the one.\nSpeaker 5: Very specific land use recommendations and height recommendations that were in the plans to reduce the density. And then when you break it out into multiple rezonings, it's your only way to guarantee that you'll get that through the entitlements.\nSpeaker 1: Now, you had mentioned before, and I don't know if my fellow fellow council people probably already know this, but just we don't have parking requirements for single family homes, do we? No, no. We're not in the old code and not in the new code. Correct. Every city said every single city scene, so that three times west cities single family detached home has no parking requirements to my.\nSpeaker 5: Now in terms of Standard Basin districts, I can say that's true. There might be some customized ones that required it.\nSpeaker 1: And if we began to require them all to have two parking places, that would mean everybody would have to build a garage or something, right?\nSpeaker 5: That's true. There'd be no choice because they would be required off site. I mean, you wouldn't have to necessarily build a garage, but you'd have to build pads or driveways to accommodate them.\nSpeaker 1: And so because of that, because the neighbors asked the the Laurie Authority did request two parking spaces for. For the row homes they do already have the zone code has one parking space for the row homes and they did request it for CPD. Turn them down. Right.\nSpeaker 5: We recommended or we suggested that they would lose the support because it was such a deviation from other similar zone districts and the policy embedded in this similar zone district to bump up the parking requirement.\nSpeaker 1: Now the zoning code that had one parking place for row homes was done with a large public process, wasn't it?\nSpeaker 5: Yes, it was. We just we distinguished or differentiated the parking requirements based on the type of neighborhood. And so we have higher parking requirements in suburban multi-unit versus urban or in this case, even more dense general.\nSpeaker 1: Urban types of general area, neighborhood. And yet the single family homes don't have any parking requirements. The townhomes have one. Their design guidelines call for two in both of those instances. Right.\nSpeaker 5: And it's a minimum.\nSpeaker 1: And it's a minimum.\nSpeaker 5: The minimum. And as it's worked through the market and demands, it gets built to varying levels beyond the minimum or.\nSpeaker 1: At the minimum. And generally developers will provide two parking spaces.\nSpeaker 5: Well, as we see in the rest of Lowry, for example. They certainly they certainly do even in the some of the townhome developments.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilwoman Sassaman, councilman noted.\nSpeaker 4: Thank you, Mr. President. This question is for Tina. And by the way, whoever it was who got sick of you. Big time.\nSpeaker 1: Big time.\nSpeaker 5: I'm actually on vacation today.\nSpeaker 1: Oh.\nSpeaker 4: Oh, I'd hate to be them, but right now I'd hate to be you. So I don't I don't think I agree with Mr. Kerwin about the the the parking and traffic issues. As they say, our citizens hate nothing more than urban sprawl and density. But I do have to agree with him on this. The the use of the waiver. I'm just help me get over what seems sort of Orwellian to me. So we usually when Orwellian. Yeah. I mean when when you when you wave something, you're usually waving a right. It's like I have a right to ABCD, F and G and I'm waiving my right to F and G. In this case, we're sort of waving our hands and creating more height.\nSpeaker 5: It's just way too many partners.\nSpeaker 1: So that's part of the evening.\nSpeaker 4: I mean, we're we're waving an increase.\nSpeaker 5: It's an odd name for what the tool has traditionally been used for in the city of Denver.\nSpeaker 6: For better or.\nSpeaker 5: For worse, it can go either way. You can wave its take a height standard through the legislative process. Even for a quasi judicial rezoning you through a waiver, you can take an existing standard of 30 feet and wave that right to build 30. But instead you have to. Okay, so you waive it. It goes away. That's. That's true. You wave bye bye. It goes away. What you put back in its place can either be an increase or decrease.\nSpeaker 4: Okay. We do administrative adjustments to adjust to existing.\nSpeaker 5: But so if you had your house in Wash Park or you know, if you tore it down and on the same side of the street, everybody or the majority had built to 35 feet in the rear third that now we have a process through the administrative adjustment review to allow that new infill house to match the bulk and height that's otherwise there.\nSpeaker 4: Right now that makes perfect sense to me. That's the yeah we don't.\nSpeaker 5: But the problem is that that process is tied very specifically to compatibility criteria. You have to be compatible to something that exist here. We don't have anything that exists to compare it to.\nSpeaker 4: Fair enough. But we do have a complete zoning code.\nSpeaker 5: We have a very complete zoning code. But, you know, as you all know, our ability to foresee the future through zoning is not perfect. And therefore, we have the capability, smart people that the city council was in 2010 to adopt.\nSpeaker 7: A code.\nSpeaker 5: That offers tools to vary or flex otherwise standard zoned districts. Sometimes it's a party which in practice now we require applicants to tie to a standard zone district and just vary from it. So they're not making things up totally out of whack with the rest of the zoning. Lessons learned. We have overlay zones which sometimes can be used to add an additional layer of standards that aren't otherwise in the standard zone district. We still have waivers and conditions. It's in the code. We did not get rid of it in 2010, though personally, I would have loved to wave bye bye to waivers. But it's another tool and it's there, and we're trying to be very, very judicious in the way we use it. This would be the first case of a rezoning going through with waiver. Since 2010, we've been able to accommodate other needs for flexibility through other pdes or overlays, and you'll see more of that coming through. In this case, there is a lot of advantage to maintaining that base zone district on the map as a usou a or UCB. BE It is very transparent right on the map what it is, we're just allowing a bulk here for its only form standards that we're very we're not burying other parking were the general design standards that you typically would also see in PDS that come before PDS tend to cut across the whole code and do things or add things or take away things, right? This was just one very kind of a whole need to change the bulk and height of these buildings. And so a waiver felt like the most precise way to get to a turn of the dial rather than a pad and an overlay. There are other reasons with overlay, including a minimum area requirement and the fact that you can't use an overlay to give more than what the underlying zone allows. So we couldn't get to that greater height or bulk through an overlay zone. So that left the kind of looking hard APD or waiver and PD felt like a real overkill for this type of variation.\nSpeaker 4: Yeah, I guess I would have. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1: I don't know if.\nSpeaker 5: We'll ever do it again, but.\nSpeaker 4: Well, that's I mean, I find that comment reassuring, honestly. It's, you know, we went to a lot of trouble to.\nSpeaker 5: We did.\nSpeaker 4: Do. We did. Zoning code you referred to you know in of the previous council that adopted that.\nSpeaker 6: We.\nSpeaker 5: Tried very hard to push it into other that peg into other holes but it's still a tool that you know is might be useful. But generally we were able to accommodate it through other means. Okay.\nSpeaker 4: Well, thank you. You've given me somewhat more comfort.\nSpeaker 5: Are you feeling less Orwellian?\nSpeaker 4: I still like that. It's called a waiver.\nSpeaker 5: I'd rather be called banana or something.\nSpeaker 2: Tara thank you. Councilman there, Councilwoman Lemon.\nSpeaker 7: Thank you, Mr. President. Tina, how more can you pass? Will people be able to park on the street in this area?\nSpeaker 5: Yes. These are public streets being, as you see in the illustrative correct mistake. So we're creating new punching through the local street grid into this. And, of course, LOWRY And on street parking will be available on all public streets as per other general design standards for Denver streets.\nSpeaker 7: And not counted in the number of parking places somebody could take their apartment, say, oh, there's there's mice.\nSpeaker 5: You don't you don't get to count on street parking, torture, minimum required off street parking. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you thank you. Councilwoman moment. Councilwoman Susman.\nSpeaker 1: To Councilman Leavitt's question, I don't think we actually heard why we wanted to change the Bolt plane or why we wanted to have taller buildings. And I think we understand why in order to get those, we had to do a waiver because there was no comparison nearby houses to say, oh, well, we want it to look like that house and therefore couldn't do an adjustment. Then I don't know that we got an answer form of why would in the first place did we want to go higher and have a bulk plane? Did you get feel like you had that answer?\nSpeaker 4: I mean, I think I know why is because the developer wants more square footage too.\nSpeaker 1: So no, it's for net zero. It's for. Oh well let's have an answer to that. Yeah, that's, it's for. Ecological reasons. Do you want to monitor or do you want to address them?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. First, with respect to the bullet point, for instance, we have neighborhoods just across Quebec from this neighborhood that have two storey elements of garages and a garage with living space above them, adjacent to the alley under all the rest of their lives. And we were trying to replicate that pattern. And by using and we didn't have a PBGC available to us. So, for instance, that was zoned to a with waivers and conditions and had an overlay of a PBJ to it to allow us to have the development pattern that we had. Under the new code, we couldn't do that because we didn't have PBGC available to us, which is why we're asking for those waivers. With respect to sustainability on this site. We're trying to reach really high standards with respect to water usage, energy usage. And this more compact development pattern certainly lends itself to that.\nSpeaker 1: The main reason.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman and Councilwoman Ortega.\nSpeaker 6: Mr. Force, if you could stay up there, I do have one more question for you. Out of the 250 units that are proposed for these three applications, are they all proposed to be for sale units or will they be a mix of rental and for sale?\nSpeaker 0: In these three applications, these would all be for sale.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. And the DA. Are those proposed to be rental?\nSpeaker 0: Those would be rental.\nSpeaker 6: Okay. I do have a question for Mr. Yoshida, if you wouldn't mind coming forward. So I know you have a lot of experience as an architect in working with different developers who build projects. And the zoning always says one thing in terms of the requirements. But the reality of what a developer ends up building doesn't always exactly match what the zoning code says. And again, as Tina said, it's a minimum. So can you just speak to what your experience is when there is, you know, a requirement that sets something lower than what the demand may be?\nSpeaker 4: In regards to speaking specifically.\nSpeaker 6: To the Rowhouse project, where residents have raised question and concern about, they believe that two two parking spaces per unit should be more apropos. And again, I understand that in the design review process that can be spoken to, but, you know, that's a process down the road and.\nSpeaker 4: I'm happy to describe that. You can tell me if it's responsive for the real homes in particular. It is relevant to the time and place and market forces that. Lowry We understand and heard the neighborhood concerns about one or not having two spaces per unit. The nature of as a developer, this discussion is relevant to multi-family as well as density increases. A developer winds up not only thinking about what the maximum or minimums are allowed to by zoning, but his target market. So in this case, as as resolution is brought on the plan, as Mr. Force indicated, two spaces per unit seems to match with the developer's expectations for what they want to be perceived as successful product for this site. So at this point, staff, lay staff and the design review board are continuing to communicate that to space minimum to potential developers, and that's being accepted as parallel to their market interest right now.\nSpeaker 6: Thank you very much.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilwoman Ortega, are there any questions on 522, three or four and seeing and the public hearing is now closed. This is an opportunity for councilmembers to comment on either five, 22, five, 23 or five, 24. And we will start with Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you, Tina, for your marathon presentation of the of the Bills. And thank you to everybody who spoke this evening. This has been a very long process and very lots of public input. And you can see the results of the public input. It is less dense than it started. It does have design guidelines that are responsive to what the public has asked for, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote for it.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilwoman Sussman. Councilwoman Robb.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mr. President. I just wanted to speak for to why this is an appropriate rezoning for the site and to the waivers and conditions issue. Yes, we kept it in as a tool on the zoning code task force. I feel like I'm the last living member of that. But at any rate, we kept that in the toolbox with the intention that it would not be used very often, but that it was a viable tool. And Councilman Nevett, I agree with you. It's weird to waive things in instead of waive them out. We had that problem under the old code. But the interesting part I think, of why we kept in waivers and conditions was because the citizen representatives on the task force really wanted it us to from Steve Kaplan to the architects, they said, yes, we shouldn't use them so much, but we're not going to get rid of them entirely. If there is anybody in the room like maybe Bob Golic who sat through some of those meetings, even when we interviewed the potential consultants, we said, do you see these in other cities? Are they still necessary tools? And there was some advocacy to have that. The way I look at it, there's only one other way this could possibly have been zoned it. I'm not going to apply to work at the Planning Department after my stint here, but another thing we could do that I'm glad that we did in Cherry Creek and the neighbors are. Necessarily recommending is go to a higher zone district is someone implied and not a mixed use district of some sort and then put either the overlay on that tone it down or the regulating leading plan. And the regulating plan is something that is done after the zoning. And I probably would have given neighbors ulcers as we experienced in Cherry Creek about that. Ultimately, I think that project is going to work out okay. There have been some changes and it still fits in the regulating plan, but you're just picking a tool to meet all the needs. And it's certainly clear to me that Lori is a strange dog. No offense to anybody who lives in Lowrey, but throughout I mean, I still didn't find out tonight what one stood for. So throughout the zoning of it, there have been tools used there that have been unique because filling in what was 866 acres when we started is a unique situation in a city that's landlocked. So I'll be supporting this.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Councilman Rob. Councilwoman Sussman.\nSpeaker 1: I just wanted to talk to the oh one. My understanding and I don't know if maybe Brian can remember this back in 1994 when we started, oh one means no zoning because the it was a military base. It didn't have any any need to respond to any zoning codes. And that's how we always understood it. Oh, one man not zoned. Maybe we should just put waivers and conditions on that. Yes, right now don't zone and don't do this either. They just won't want filler.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Councilman Sussman, any other comments from members of councilors on 522, three or four? Okay.

{"text":"Incidental placental choriocarcinoma in a term pregnancy: a case report\n\nIntroduction Gestational choriocarcinoma occurs in 1 in 40,000 pregnancies. Of all forms of gestational choriocarcinoma, placental choriocarcinoma is the most rare. Maternal choriocarcinoma is usually diagnosed in symptomatic patients with metastases. The incidental finding of a choriocarcinoma confined to the placenta with no evidence of dissemination to the mother, or infant is the least common scenario. Case presentation The patient is an 18 year-old Gravida 1 Para 1 African American female who delivered a viable 3641 g female infant at 39 weeks gestation. Her pregnancy course was complicated by gestational hypertension during the third trimester. Her placenta revealed intraplacental choriocarcinoma. She was then followed closely by the Gynecologic Oncology service with a weekly serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin value. Beta human chorionic gonadotropin values dropped from 3070 mIU\/ml to less than 2 mIU\/ml two months post partum. No chemotherapy was initiated. Metastasis was ruled out by chest x-ray and whole body computed tomography scan. To date, both mother and baby are well. Conclusion Due to the potential fatal outcome of placental choriocarcinoma, careful evaluation of both mother and infant after the diagnosis is made is important. The incidence of placental choriocarcinoma may actually be higher than expected since it is not routine practice to send placentas for pathological evaluation after a normal spontaneous delivery. The obstetrician, pathologist, and pediatrician should have an increased awareness of placental choriocarcinoma and its manifestations.\n\n\nIntroduction\nGestational choriocarcinoma occurs in 1 in 40,000 pregnancies. It is a highly aggressive malignant tumor of the trophoblasts found in association with any form of gestation. Of all forms of gestational choriocarcinoma, placental choriocarcinoma is the most rare and is usually diagnosed in symptomatic patients with metastases.\nMetastases to the lung and brain usually occur in the mother, but metastatic choriocarcinoma in the fetus or neonates does occur. The incidental finding of a choriocarcinoma confined to the placenta with no evidence of dissemination to mother or infant is the least common scenario.\n\nCase presentation\nThe patient is an 18 year-old African American Gravida 1 Para 0 at her 39 th weeks of gestation who presented to a hospital in the St. Louis area in early labor. After rupture of membranes, light meconium was noted. The patient subsequently delivered a viable female infant vaginally, weighing 3641 g, with Apgar scores of 9 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes. Her pregnancy course was complicated by gestational hypertension during the third trimester. She was treated with magnesium sulfate during labor for possible pre-eclampsia due to elevated blood pressure intrapartum. Her blood pressure was normal after delivery, and her post partum course was unremarkable. The placenta appeared to be grossly normal with a 3 vessel cord at the time of delivery. Because of the patient's history of gestational hypertension, the placenta was sent to pathology and placental choriocarcinoma was diagnosed (Figures 1  &2). She was then referred to and followed closely by the Gynecologic Oncology service. Her serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) dropped from 3070 mIU\/ ml to less than 2 mIU\/ml six weeks post partum. No chemotherapy was initiated. She had also undergone multiple studies such as chest x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan which all ruled out metastasis during the one year post partum period. The infant was followed by the pediatric service. To date, both mother and baby have been disease free for eight years.\n\nPathologic findings\nThe placenta measured 15 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 up to 4 cm with a trimmed weight of 530 grams and was notable only for a 3 cm cyst-like area on cut section. Microscopic examination showed a choriocarcinoma with a biphasic proliferation of atypical and mitotically active cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast notable for extensive involvement of villi, many completely encompassed by collars of neoplastic trophoblast. Some villi were partially involved with a transition from normal to neoplastic trophoblast. There was no involvement of villous stromal vessels. The tumor showed extensive central necrosis in which the ghost-like outlines of necrotic villi could be discerned. The remainder of the placenta was mature, showing only focal villous edema.\n\nDiscussion\nWe performed a medline search (1966 to 2008) using the keywords placenta, choriocarcinoma, and trophoblastic disease. We found 21 articles with 32 cases of placental choriocarcinoma in the English literature. Fourteen cases of choriocarcinoma were confined to the placenta with no evidence of dissemination to mother or infant; five of these 14 cases were incidentally identified in patients with normal pregnancies. To our knowledge, our case is the sixth of this type.\nChoriocarcinoma in the placenta differs somewhat from those occurring elsewhere. The majority of placental choriocarcinomas appeared as poorly defined lesions macroscopically, and they are often interpreted as placental infarcts or intervillus thrombi. It is often only after metastatic symptoms occur in mother or infant that the placenta is resubmitted for further evaluation, and small lesions are identified microscopically. When recognized grossly, most placental choriocarcinomas have been described as yellow-white granular lesions thought to be infarcts. Microscopically, placental choriocarcinomas usually revealed areas in which the trophoblast is distributed as a mantle around villi with partial involvement and transition from normal trophoblast. This surface villous Interface between choriocarcinoma with central necrosis (top) and normal placenta (hematoxilin and eosin staining) Figure 1 Interface between choriocarcinoma with central necrosis (top) and normal placenta (hematoxilin and eosin staining).\nVilli surrounded by collars of neoplastic trophoblast (arrows) Figure 2 Villi surrounded by collars of neoplastic trophoblast (arrows).\ngrowth is often at the periphery of a central zone composed of necrotic, confluent trophoblast and villi explaining its gross resemblance to an infarct. Invasion of villous stroma has been described in rare cases.\nObstetrically, the majority of the reported cases had a normal prenatal course. Placental choriocarcinoma was often diagnosed after the mother developed symptoms of metastasis either antepartum or postpartum. The symptoms included vaginal bleeding, chest pain, and neurological signs such as seizures and stroke. In terms of maternal outcome, mothers who developed metastasis were often treated with chemotherapy which consisted of etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D, cytoxan or vincristine. The response rate after chemotherapy is high; the majority of mothers were disease free after 1 year. Four mothers died of disease, but these 4 cases all occurred in the early 1980s [1,2]. Kodama et al reported a case where the mother underwent partial lobectomy after pulmonary lesions were identified in 1994 [3]. Four cases of hysterectomy were reported by Brewer et al in 1981, Ollendorf in 1990, and Flam in 1996. In mothers with no evidence of metastasis, only three of the 14 cases were treated with chemotherapy; the others were followed with serial serum hCG measurement until it dropped to zero during the post partum course. Multiple imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging were often used to rule out metastasis. Our patient continued to have annual follow-up with the Gynecologic Oncology service after multiple studies to rule out metastasis in the first year post partum.\nIn terms of fetal outcome, ten cases resulted in either intrauterine demise or neonatal death. In 2006, Liu and Guo reported the only case in which an infant was successfully treated with chemotherapy after metastasis to jejunum and lungs was identified [6]. Most of the infants born showed no evidence of disease after 1 year.\nDue to the potential fatal outcome of placental choriocarcinoma, the diagnosis should require careful evaluation of both mother and infant. Other clinical manifestations such as hyperthyroidism which is sometimes associated with high serum HCG should also be ruled out. Hyperemesis gravidarum is a common symptom in patients with hyperthyroidism. Serial serum beta hCGs and imaging studies should be employed to rule out metastasis. Maternal metastasis is very responsive to chemotherapy. Fetal metastasis is rare and usually fatal. In cases where placental choriocarcinoma is confined to the placenta without evidence of metastasis, only three of the 14 cases were treated with methotrexate chemotherapy, and the others were followed by serial beta hCG and imaging studies, all with excellent outcome. We believe in these cases, no chemotherapy is needed, providing serial beta hCG and imaging studies during postpartum follow up remain normal.\n\nConclusion\nIt is not a routine practice to send a placenta for pathological evaluation following a normal spontaneous delivery. However, a number of cases, like ours, reported incidental findings of placental choriocarcinoma in asymptomatic mothers and infants with no evidence of metastases. In the majority of these cases, the placenta was sent to pathology due to other pregnancy complications such as intrauterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, maternal fetal hemorrhage, and in our case, gestational hypertension. It is our belief that the incidence of placental choriocarcinoma may actually be higher than reported. It is also well established that early detection and treatment of gestational trophoblastic disease improves treatment outcome.

{"text":" The following is a conversation with Pamela McCordick. She's an author who has written on the history and the philosophical significance of artificial intelligence. Her books include Machines Who Think in 1979, The Fifth Generation in 1983 with Ed Fagenbaum, who's considered to be the father of expert systems, The Edge of Chaos that features women, and many more books. I came across her work in an unusual way by stumbling in a quote from Machines Who Think that is something like, artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods. That was a beautiful way to draw a connecting line between our societal relationship with AI from the grounded day-to-day science, math, and engineering to popular stories and science fiction and myths of automatons that go back for centuries. Through her literary work, she has spent a lot of time with the seminal figures of artificial intelligence, including the founding fathers of AI from the 1956 Dartmouth summer workshop where the field was launched. I reached out to Pamela for a conversation in hopes of getting a sense of what those early days were like and how their dreams continued to reverberate through the work of our community today. I often don't know where the conversation may take us, but I jump in and see. Having no constraints, rules, or goals is a wonderful way to discover new ideas.

And now here's my conversation with Pamela McCordick. In 1979, your book Machines Who Think was published. In it, you interviewed some of the early AI pioneers and explored the idea that AI was born not out of maybe math and computer science, but out of myth and legend. So tell me if you could the story of how you first arrived at the book, the journey of beginning to write it. I had been a novelist. I'd published two novels. And I was sitting under the portal at Stanford one day in the house we were renting for the summer. And I thought, I should write a novel about these weird people in AI I know. And then I thought, ah, don't write a novel, write a history. Simple, just go around, interview them, splice it together, voila, instant book. Ha, ha, ha. It was much harder than that. But nobody else was doing it. And so I thought, well, this is a great opportunity. And there were people who, John McCarthy, for example, thought it was a nutty idea. The field had not evolved yet, so on. And he had some mathematical thing he thought I should write instead. And I said, no, John, I am not a woman in search of a project. This is what I want to do. I hope you'll cooperate. And he said, oh, mutter, mutter, well, OK, it's your time. What was the pitch for the, I mean, such a young field at that point. How do you write a personal history of a field that's so young? I said, this is wonderful. The founders of the field are alive and kicking and able to talk about what they're doing. Did they sound or feel like founders at the time? Did they know that they know that they have founded something? Oh, yeah. They knew what they were doing was very important. What I now see in retrospect is that they were at the height of their research careers. And it's humbling to me that they took time out from all the things that they had to do as a consequence of being there and to talk to this woman who said, I think I'm going to write a book about you. No, it was amazing. Just amazing. So who stands out to you? Maybe looking 63 years ago, the Dartmouth Conference. So Marvin Minsky was there. McCarthy was there. Claude Shannon, Alan Newell, Herb Simon, some of the folks you've mentioned. Then there's other characters, right? One of your co-authors. He wasn't at Dartmouth. He wasn't at Dartmouth. No. But I mean, he was I think an undergraduate then. And of course, Joe Traub. I mean, all of these are players, not at Dartmouth, but in that era. Right. CMU and so on. So who are the characters, if you could paint a picture that stand out to you from memory? Those people you've interviewed and maybe not people that were just in the atmosphere. Of course, the four founding fathers were extraordinary guys. They really were. Who are the founding fathers? Alan Newell, Herbert Simon, Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy. They were the four who were not only at the Dartmouth Conference, but Newell and Simon arrived there with a working program called the Logic Theorist. Everybody else had great ideas about how they might do it, but they weren't going to do it yet. And you mentioned Joe Traub, my husband. I was immersed in AI before I met Joe because I had been Ed Feigenbaum's assistant at Stanford. And before that, I had worked on a book edited by Feigenbaum and Julian Feldman called Computers and Thought. It was the first textbook of readings of AI. And they only did it because they were trying to teach AI to people at Berkeley. And you'd have to send them to this journal and that journal. This was not the internet where you could go look at an article. So I was fascinated from the get-go by AI. I was an English major. What did I know? And yet I was fascinated. And that's why you saw that historical, that literary background, which I think is very much a part of the continuum of AI. That AI grew out of that same impulse. That traditional, what drew you to AI? How did you even think of it back then? What was the possibilities, the dreams? What was interesting to you? The idea of intelligence outside the human cranium, this was a phenomenal idea. And even when I finished Machines Who Think, I didn't know if they were going to succeed. In fact, the final chapter is very wishy-washy, frankly. I'll succeed the field did. Yeah. So was there the idea that AI began with the wish to forge the gods? So the spiritual component that we crave to create this other thing greater than ourselves? For those guys, I don't think so. Newell and Simon were cognitive psychologists. What they wanted was to simulate aspects of human intelligence and they found they could do it on the computer. Minsky just thought it was a really cool thing to do. Likewise, McCarthy. McCarthy had got the idea in 1949 when he was a Caltech student. And he listened to somebody's lecture. It's in my book. I forget who it was. And he thought, oh, that would be fun to do. How do we do that? And he took a very mathematical approach. Minsky was hybrid and Newell and Simon were very much cognitive psychology. How can we simulate various things about human cognition? What happened over the many years is, of course, our definition of intelligence expanded tremendously. These days, biologists are comfortable talking about the intelligence of a cell, the intelligence of the brain, not just human brain, but the intelligence of any kind of brain. Cephalopause, an octopus is really intelligent by any... We wouldn't have thought of that in the 60s, even the 70s. So all these things have worked in. And I did hear one behavioral primatologist, Franz de Waal, say AI taught us the questions to ask. Yeah, this is what happens, right? When you try to build it is when you start to actually ask questions, it puts a mirror to ourselves. Yeah, right. So you were there in the middle of it. It seems like not many people were asking the questions that you were, just trying to look at this field the way you were. I was solo. When I went to get funding for this because I needed somebody to transcribe the interviews and I needed travel expenses, I went to everything you could think of, the NSA, NSF, DARPA. There was an Air Force place that doled out money. And each of them said, well, that was very interesting. That's a very interesting idea, but we'll think about it. And the National Science Foundation actually said to me in plain English, hey, you're only a writer. You're not a historian of science. And I said, yeah, that's true. But the historians of science will be crawling all over this field. I'm writing for the general audience, so I thought. And they still wouldn't budge. I finally got a private grant without knowing who it was from, from Ed Fredkin at MIT. He was a wealthy man and he liked what he called crackpot ideas. And he considered- This a crackpot idea? This a crackpot idea and he was willing to support it. I am ever grateful. Let me say that. Some would say that a history of science approach to AI or even just a history or anything like the book that you've written hasn't been written since. Maybe I'm not familiar, but it's certainly not many. If we think about bigger than just these couple of decades, few decades, what are the roots of AI? Oh, they go back so far. Yes, of course, there's all the legendary stuff, the Golem and the early robots of the 20th century. But they go back much further than that. If you read Homer, Homer has robots in the Iliad. And a classical scholar was pointing out to me just a few months ago, well, you said you just read the Odyssey. The Odyssey is full of robots. It is, I said. Yeah. How do you think Odysseus' ship gets from one place to another? He doesn't have the crew people to do that, the crew men. Yeah, it's magic, it's robots. Oh, I thought. How interesting. So we've had this notion of AI for a long time. And then toward the end of the 19th century, the beginning of the 20th century, there were scientists who actually tried to make this happen some way or another, not successfully. They didn't have the technology for it. And of course, Babbage in the 1850s and 60s, he saw that what he was building was capable of intelligent behavior. And when he ran out of funding, the British government finally said, that's enough. He and Lady Lovelace decided, oh, well, why don't we play the ponies with this? He had other ideas for raising money too. But if we actually reach back once again, I think people don't actually really know that robots do appear or ideas of robots. You talk about the Hellenic and the Hebraic points of view. Oh, yes. Can you tell me about each? Tell me about each. I defined it this way. The Hellenic point of view is robots are great. They are party help. They help this guy Hephaestus, this God Hephaestus in his forge. I presume he made them to help him and so on and so forth. And they welcome the whole idea of robots. The Hebraic view has to do with, I think it's the second commandment, thou shalt not make any graven image. In other words, you better not start imitating humans because that's just forbidden. It's the second commandment. And a lot of the reaction to artificial intelligence has been in a sense that this is somehow wicked. This is somehow blasphemous. We shouldn't be going there. Now, you can say, yeah, but there are going to be some downsides. And I say, yes, there are, but blasphemy is not one of them. There is a kind of fear that feels to be almost primal. Is there religious roots to that? Because so much of our society has religious roots. And so there is a feeling of, like you said, blasphemy, of creating the other, of creating something. It doesn't have to be artificial intelligence. It's creating life in general. It's the Frankenstein idea. It was the annotated Frankenstein on my coffee table. It's a tremendous novel. It really is just beautifully perceptive. Yes, we do fear this and we have good reason to fear it, because it can get out of hand. Maybe you can speak to that fear, the psychology, if you've thought about it. There's a practical set of fears, concerns in the short term. If we actually think about artificial intelligence systems, you can think about bias of discrimination in algorithms. You can think about their social networks have algorithms that recommend the content you see. Thereby, these algorithms control the behavior of the masses. There's these concerns. But to me, it feels like the fear that people have is deeper than that. So have you thought about the psychology of it? I think in a superficial way, I have. There is this notion that if we produce a machine that can think, it will outthink us and therefore replace us. I guess that's a primal fear of almost kind of a kind of mortality. So around the time, you said you work with Stanford, with Ed Fagenbaum. So let's look at that one person throughout his history. Clearly a key person, one of the many in the history of AI. How has he changed in general around him? How has Stanford changed in the last, how many years are we talking about here? Oh, since 65. 65. So maybe it doesn't have to be about him. It could be bigger, but because he was a key person in expert systems, for example, how is that? How are these folks who you've interviewed in the 70s, 79 changed through the decades? In Ed's case, I know him well. We are dear friends. We see each other every month or so. He told me that when Machines Who Think first came out, he really thought all the front matter was kind of baloney. He said, well, all the front matter was kind of baloney. And 10 years later, he said, no, I see what you're getting at. Yes, this has been a human impulse for thousands of years to create something outside the human cranium that has intelligence. I think it's very hard when you're down at the algorithmic level and you're just trying to make something work, which is hard enough, just step back and think of the big picture. It reminds me of when I was in Santa Fe, I knew a lot of archeologists, which was a hobby of mine. And I would say, yeah, yeah, well, you can look at the shards and say, oh, this came from this tribe and this came from this trade route and so on. But what about the big picture? And a very distinguished archeologist said to me, they don't think that way. No, they're trying to match the shard to where it came from. Where did this corn, remainder of this corn come from? Was it grown here? Was it grown elsewhere? And I think this is part of the AI, any scientific field. You're so busy doing the hard work, and it is hard work, that you don't step back and say, oh, well, now let's talk about the general meaning of all this. Yeah. So none of the, even Minsky and McCarthy, they- Oh, those guys did. Yeah, the founding fathers did. Early on or- Pretty early on. But in a different way from how I looked at it, the two cognitive psychologists, Newell and Simon, they wanted to imagine reforming cognitive psychology so that we would really, really understand the brain. Minsky was more speculative, and John McCarthy saw it as, I think I'm doing him right by this, he really saw it as a great boon for human beings to have this technology, and that was reason enough to do it. And he had wonderful, wonderful fables about how, if you do the mathematics, you will see that these things are really good for human beings. And if you had a technological objection, he had an answer, a technological answer, but here's how we could get over that, and then blah, blah, blah, blah. And one of his favorite things was what he called the literary problem, which of course he presented to me several times. That is, everything in literature, there are conventions in literature. One of the conventions is that you have a villain and a hero, and the hero in most literature is human, and the villain in most literature is a machine. And he said, no, that's just not the way it's going to be, but that's the way we're used to it. So when we tell stories about AI, it's always with this paradigm. I thought, yeah, he's right. Looking back, the classics, RUR is certainly the machines trying to overthrow the humans. Frankenstein is different. Frankenstein is a creature. He never has a name. Frankenstein, of course, is the guy who created him, the human, Dr. Frankenstein. This creature wants to be loved, wants to be accepted, and it is only when Frankenstein turns his head, in fact, runs the other way, and the creature is without love that he becomes the monster that he later becomes. So who's the villain in Frankenstein? It's unclear, right? Oh, it is unclear, yeah. It's really the people who drive him. By driving him away, they bring out the worst. That's right. They give him no human solace, and he is driven away. You're right. He becomes, at one point, the friend of a blind man, and he serves this blind man, and they become very friendly. But when the sighted people of the blind man's family come in, ah, you've got a monster here. So it's very didactic in its way. What I didn't know is that Mary Shelley and Percy Shelley were great readers of the literature surrounding abolition in the United States, the abolition of slavery, and they picked that up wholesale. You know, you are making monsters of these people because you won't give them the respect and love that they deserve. Do you have, if we get philosophical for a second, do you worry that once we create machines that are a little bit more intelligent, let's look at Roomba, the vacuum cleaner, that this darker part of human nature where we abuse the other, the somebody who's different, will come out? I don't worry about it. I could imagine it happening. But I think that what AI has to offer the human race will be so attractive that people will be won over. So you have looked deep into these people, have deep conversations, and it's interesting to get a sense of stories of the way they were thinking and the way it was changed, the way your own thinking about AI has changed. So you mentioned McCarthy. What about the years at CMU, Carnegie Mellon with Joe? Sure. Joe was not in AI. He was in algorithmic complexity. Was there always a line between AI and computer science, for example? Is AI its own place of outcasts? Was that the feeling? There was a kind of outcast period for AI. For instance, in 1974, the new field was hardly 10 years old. The new field of computer science was asked by the National Science Foundation, I believe, but it may have been the National Academies, I can't remember, to tell your fellow scientists where computer science is and what it means. And they wanted to leave out AI. And they only agreed to put it in because Don Knuth said, hey, this is important. You can't just leave that out. Really? Don Knuth? Don Knuth, yes. I talked to him recently too. Out of all the people. Yes. But you see, an AI person couldn't have made that argument. He wouldn't have been believed, but Knuth was believed. Yes. So Joe Traub worked on the real stuff. Joe was working on algorithmic complexity, but he would say in plain English again and again, the smartest people I know are in AI. Really? Oh, yes. No question. Anyway, Joe loved these guys. What happened was that, I guess it was as I started to write Machines Who Think, Herb Simon and I both wrote it. Herb Simon and I became very close friends. He would walk past our house on Northumberland Street every day after work. And I would just be putting my cover on my typewriter. And I would lean out the door and say, Herb, would you like a sherry? And Herb almost always would like a sherry. So he'd stop in and we'd talk for an hour, two hours. My journal says we talked this afternoon for three hours. What was on his mind at the time in terms of on the AI side of things? Oh, we didn't talk too much about AI. We talked about other things. Just life. We both love literature. And Herb had read Proust in the original French twice all the way through. I can't, I've read it in English in translation. So we talked about literature. We talked about languages. We talked about music because he loved music. We talked about art because he was actually enough of a painter that he had to give it up because he was afraid it was interfering with his research and so on. So no, it was really just chat chat, but it was very warm. So one summer, I said to Herb, you know, my students have all the really interesting conversations. I was teaching at the University of Pittsburgh then in the English department. They get to talk about the meaning of life and that kind of thing. And what do I have? I have university meetings where we talk about the photocopying budget and whether the course on romantic poetry should be one semester or two. So Herb laughed. He said, yes, I know what you mean. He said, but you could do something about that. Dot, that was his wife, Dot and I used to have a salon at the University of Chicago every Sunday night. And we would have essentially an open house and people knew it wasn't for a small talk. It was really for some topic of depth. He said, but my advice would be that you choose the topic ahead of time. Fine. I said, so the following, we exchanged mail over the summer. That was US post in those days because you didn't have personal email. And I decided I would organize it and there would be eight of us, Alan Null and his wife, Herb Simon and his wife, Dorothea. There was a novelist in town, a man named Mark Harris. He had just arrived and his wife, Josephine. Mark was most famous then for a novel called Bang the Drum Slowly, which was about baseball and Joe and me, so eight people. And we met monthly and we just sank our teeth into really hard topics. And it was great fun. How have your own views around artificial intelligence changed through the process of writing Machines Who Think and afterwards the ripple effects? I was a little skeptical that this whole thing would work out. It didn't matter to me. It was so audacious. This whole thing being AI. AI generally, yeah. And in some ways, it hasn't worked out the way I expected so far. That is to say there's this wonderful lot of apps thanks to deep learning and so on, but those are algorithmic. And in the part of symbolic processing, there is very little yet. And that's a field that lies waiting for industrious graduate students. Maybe you can tell me some figures that popped up in your life in the 80s with expert systems where there was the symbolic AI possibilities of what most people think of as AI. If you dream of the possibilities, AI is really expert systems. And those hit a few walls and there were challenges there. And I think, yes, they will reemerge again with some new breakthroughs and so on. But what did that feel like, both the possibility and the winter that followed, the slowdown and research? Ah, you know, this whole thing about AI winter is to me a crock. It's no winters. Because I look at the basic research that was being done in the 80s, which is supposed to be, my God, it was really important. It was laying down things that nobody had thought about before, but it was basic research. You couldn't monetize it, hence the winter. Hence the winter. You know, research, scientific research goes and fits and starts. It isn't this nice, smooth, oh, this follows this, follows this. No, it just doesn't work that way. The interesting thing, the way winters happen, it's never the fault of the researchers. It's the some source of hype over promising. Well, no, let me take that back. Sometimes it is the fault of the researchers. Sometimes certain researchers might over promise the possibilities. They themselves believe that we're just a few years away, sort of just recently talked to Elon Musk and he believes he'll have an autonomous vehicle. We'll have autonomous vehicles in a year. And he believes it. A year? A year, yeah. We'll have mass deployment of our time. For the record, this is 2019 right now. So he's talking 2020. To do the impossible, you really have to believe it. And I think what's going to happen when you believe it, because there's a lot of really brilliant people around him, is some good stuff will come out of it. Some unexpected, brilliant breakthroughs will come out of it when you really believe it, when you work that hard. Yeah, I believe that. And I believe autonomous vehicles will come. I just don't believe it'll be in a year. I wish. But nevertheless, autonomous vehicles is a good example. There's a feeling many companies have promised by 2021, by 2022, Ford, GM, basically every single automotive company has promised they'll have autonomous vehicles. So that kind of over promise is what leads to the winter. Because we'll come to those dates. There won't be autonomous vehicles. And there'll be a feeling, well, wait a minute, if we took your word at that time, that means we just spent billions of dollars, had made no money, and there's a counter response to where everybody gives up on it. Sort of intellectually, at every level, the hope just dies. And all that's left is a few basic researchers. So you're uncomfortable with some aspects of this idea. Well, it's the difference between science and commerce. So you think science goes on the way it does? Science can really be killed by not getting proper funding or timely funding. I think Great Britain was a perfect example of that. The Lighthill report in, I don't remember the year, essentially said, there's no use Great Britain putting any money into this. It's going nowhere. And this was all about social factions in Great Britain. Edinburgh hated Cambridge and Cambridge hated Manchester. Somebody else can write that story. But it really did have a hard effect on research there. Now, they've come roaring back with deep mind, but that's one guy and his visionaries around him. But just to push on that, it's kind of interesting. You have this dislike of the idea of an AI winter. Where's that coming from? Where were you? Oh, because I just don't think it's true. There was a particular periods of time. It's a romantic notion, certainly. Yeah, well, I admire science, perhaps more than I admire commerce. Commerce is fine. Hey, you know, we all got to live. But science has a much longer view than commerce and continues almost regardless. It can't continue totally regardless, but it's almost regardless of what's saleable and what's not, what's monetizable and what's not. So the winter is just something that happens on the commerce side and the science marches. That's a beautifully optimistic, inspiring message. I agree with you. I think if we look at the key people that work in AI, they work in key scientists, most disciplines, they continue working out of the box. They continue working out of the box. They work in key scientists, most disciplines, they continue working out of the love for science. No matter the, you can always scrape up some funding to stay alive and they continue working diligently, but there certainly is a huge amount of funding now and there's a concern on the AI side and deep learning. There's a concern that we might with over-promising hit another slowdown in funding, which does affect the number of students, that kind of thing. Yeah, it does. So the kind of ideas you had in Michigan to think, did you continue that curiosity through the decades that followed? Yes, I did. What was your view, historical view of how AI community evolved, the conversations about it, the work? Has it persisted the same way from its birth? No, of course not. It's just, as we were just talking, the symbolic AI really kind of dried up and it all became algorithmic. I remember a young AI student telling me what he was doing and I had been away from the field long enough. I'd gotten involved with complexity at the Santa Fe Institute. I thought, algorithms, yeah, they're in the service of, but they're not the main event. No, they became the main event. That surprised me. And we all know the downside of this. We all know that if you're using an algorithm to make decisions based on a gazillion human decisions, baked into it are all the mistakes that humans make, the bigotries, the short-sightedness, so on and so on. So you mentioned Santa Fe Institute. So you've written the novel Edge of Chaos, but it's inspired by the ideas of complexity, a lot of which have been extensively explored at the Santa Fe Institute. It's another fascinating topic of just sort of emergent complexity from chaos. Nobody knows how it happens really, but it seems to wear all the interesting stuff that does happen. So how did first, not your novel, but just complexity in general in the work at Santa Fe fit into the bigger puzzle of the history of AI, or maybe even your personal journey through that? One of the last projects I did concerning AI in particular was looking at the work of Harold Cohen, the painter. And Harold was deeply involved with AI. He was a painter first, and what his project, Aran, which was a lifelong project, did was reflect his own cognitive processes. Harold and I, even though I wrote a book about it, we had a lot of friction between us. And I went, I thought, this is it, the book died, it was published and fell into a ditch. This is it, I'm finished, it's time for me to do something different. By chance, this was a sabbatical year for my husband, and we spent two months at the Santa Fe Institute and two months at Caltech, and then the spring semester in Munich, Germany. Okay, those two months at the Santa Fe Institute were so restorative for me. The institute was very small then. It was in some kind of office complex on old Santa Fe Trail. Everybody kept their door open. So you could crack your head on a problem, and if you finally didn't get it, you could walk in to see Stuart Kaufman or any number of people and say, I don't get this, can you explain? And one of the people that I was talking to about complex adaptive systems was Murray Gell-Mann. And I told Murray what Harold Cohen had done. And I said, you know, this sounds to me like a complex adaptive system. And he said, yeah, it is. Well, what do you know? Harold's errand had all these kissin' cousins all over the world. In science and in economics and so on and so forth. I was so relieved. I thought, okay, your instincts are okay. You're doing the right thing. I didn't have the vocabulary. And that was one of the things that the Santa Fe Institute gave me. If I could have rewritten that book, no, it had just come out. I couldn't rewrite it. I would have had a vocabulary to explain what Aaron was doing. Okay. So I got really interested in what was going on at the Institute. The people were, again, bright and funny and willing to explain anything to this amateur. George Cowan, who was then the head of the Institute, said he thought it might be a nice idea if I wrote a book about the Institute. And I thought about it. And I had a book called The God Knows What. And I said, I'm sorry, George. Yeah, I'd really love to do it, but, you know, just not going to work for me at this moment. And he said, oh, too bad. I think it would make an interesting book. Well, he was right and I was wrong. I wish I'd done it. But that's interesting. I hadn't thought about that. That that was a road not taken that I wish I'd taken. Well, you know what? That's just on that point. It's quite brave for you as a writer, as sort of coming from a world of literature, the literary thinking and historical thinking. I mean, just from that world and bravely talking to quite, I assume, large egos in AI or in complexity and so on. How'd you do it? Like, where did you? I mean, I suppose they could be intimidated of you as well, because it's two different worlds. I don't think I never picked up that anybody was intimidated by me. But how were you brave enough? Where did you find the guts? God, just dumb, dumb luck. I mean, this is an interesting rock to turn over. I'm going to write a book about it. And, you know, people have enough patience with writers if they think they're going to end up in a book that they let you flail around and so on. Well, but they also look if the writer has, there's like, if there's a sparkle in their eye, if they get it. Yeah, sure. Right. When were you at the Santa Fe Institute? The time I'm talking about is 1990, yeah, 1990, 1991, 92. But we then, because Joe was an external faculty member, we're in Santa Fe every summer. We bought a house there and I didn't have that much to do with the Institute anymore. I was writing my novels. I was doing whatever I was doing. But I loved the Institute and I loved the, again, the audacity of the ideas. That really appeals to me. I think that there's this feeling, much like in great, great institutes of neuroscience, for example, that they're in it for the long game of understanding something fundamental about reality and nature. And that's really exciting. So if we start to not to look a little bit more recently, how AI is really popular today. How is this world, you mentioned algorithmic, but in general, is the spirit of the people, the kind of conversations you hear through the gray virus on, is that different than the roots that you remember? No, the same kind of excitement, the same kind of, this is really going to make a difference in the world. And it will, it has. A lot of folks, especially young, 20 years old or something, they think we've just found something special here. We're going to change the world tomorrow. On a time scale, do you have a sense of what, of the time scale at which breakthroughs in AI happen? I really don't. I don't think so. I really don't. Because look at deep learning. That was a, Jeffrey Hinton came up with the algorithm in 86. But it took all these years for the technology to be good enough to actually be applicable. So no, I can't predict that at all. I can't, I wouldn't even try. Well, let me ask you to not to try to predict, but to speak to the, I'm sure in the 60s, as it continues now, there's people that think, let's call it, we can call it this fun word, the singularity. When there's a phase shift, there's some profound feeling where we're all really surprised by what's able to be achieved. I'm sure those dreams are there. I remember reading quotes in the 60s and those continued. How have your own views, maybe if you look back about the timeline of a singularity changed? Well, I'm not a big fan of the singularity as Ray Kurzweil has presented it. How would you define the Ray Kurzweil? How do you think of singularity in those? If I understand Kurzweil's view, it's sort of, there's going to be this moment when machines are smarter than humans and game over. However, the game over is, I mean, do they put us on a reservation? Do they, et cetera, et cetera. And first of all, machines are sort of, first of all, machines are smarter than humans in some ways all over the place. And they have been since adding machines were invented. So it's not going to come like some great eatable crossroads where they meet each other and our offspring, Oedipus says, you're dead. It's just not going to happen. Yeah. So it's already game over with calculators, right? They're already out to do much better at basic arithmetic than us. But there's a human-like intelligence and that's not the ones that destroy us, but somebody that you can have as a friend, you can have deep connections with that kind of passing the touring test and beyond those kinds of ideas. Have you dreamt of those? Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. Those possibilities. In a book I wrote with Ed Feigenbaum, there's a little story called The Geriatric Robot. And how I came up with The Geriatric Robot is a story in itself, but here's what The Geriatric Robot does. It doesn't just clean you up and feed you and wheel you out into the sun. It's great advantages. It listens. It says, tell me again about the great coup of 73. Tell me again about how awful or how wonderful your grandchildren are and so on and so forth. And it isn't hanging around to inherit your money. It isn't hanging around because it can't get any other job. This is its job and so on and so forth. Well, I would love something like that. Yeah. I mean, for me, that deeply excites me. So I think there's a lot of us- Like you gotta know, it was a joke. I dreamed it up because I needed to talk to college students and I needed to give them some idea of what AI might be. And they were rolling in the aisles as I elaborated and elaborated and elaborated. When it went into the book, they took my hide off in the New York Review of Books. This is just what we've thought about these people in AI. They're inhuman. Oh, come on, get over it. Don't you think that's a good thing for the world that AI could potentially- I do, absolutely. And furthermore, I'm pushing 80 now. By the time I need help like that, I also want it to roll itself in a corner and shut the fuck up. Let me linger on that point. Do you really though? Yeah, I do. Here's why. Don't you want it to push back a little bit? A little, but I have watched my friends go through the whole issue around having help in the house. And some of them have been very lucky and had fabulous help. And some of them have had people in the house who want to keep the television going on all day, who want to talk on their phones all day. No. So basically- Just roll yourself in the corner and shut up. Yeah. Unfortunately, us humans, when we're assistants, we still, even when we're assisting others, we care about ourselves more. Of course. And so you create more frustration. And a robot, AI assistant can really optimize the experience for you. I was just speaking to the point- you actually bring up a very, very good point. But I was speaking to the fact that us humans are a little complicated, that we don't necessarily want a perfect servant. I don't- maybe you disagree with that, but there's a- I think there's a push and pull with humans. A little tension, a little mystery that, of course, that's really difficult for AI to get right. But I do sense, especially in today with social media, that people are getting more and more lonely, even young folks. And sometimes especially young folks, that loneliness, there's a longing for connection and AI can help alleviate some of that loneliness. Some, just somebody who listens, like in person. So to speak. Yeah. So to speak. Yeah. That to me is really exciting. But so if we look at that level of intelligence, which is exceptionally difficult to achieve actually, as the singularity or whatever, that's the human level bar, that people have dreamt of that too. Turing dreamt of it. He had a date timeline. Do you have, how have your own timeline evolved on past? I don't even think about it. You don't even think? No. Just this field has been so full of surprises for me. You just take it in and see. Yeah. Oh, that's great. Yeah. I just can't. Maybe that's because I've been around the field long enough to think, you know, don't go that way. Herb Simon was terrible about making these predictions of when this and that would happen. And he was a sensible guy. His quotes are often used, right? As a legend. Yeah. Do you have concerns about AI, the existential threats of many people like Elon Musk and Sam Harris and others that are thinking about? Oh, yeah. That takes up half a chapter in my book. I call it the male gaze. Well, you hear me out. The male gaze is actually a term from film criticism. And I'm blocking on the women who dream this up, but she pointed out how most movies were made from the male point of view, that women were objects, not subjects. They didn't have any agency, so on and so forth. So when Elon and his pals Hawking and so on came, AI is going to eat our lunch and our dinner and our midnight snack too, I thought, what? And I said to Ed Feigenbaum, oh, these guys have always been the smartest guy on the block, and here comes something that might be smarter. Ooh, let's stamp it out before it takes over. And Ed laughed. He said, I didn't think about it that way. But I did. I did. And it is the male gaze. Okay, suppose these things do have agency. Well, let's wait and see what happens. Can we imbue them with ethics? Can we imbue them with a sense of empathy? Or are they just going to be, I don't know, we've had centuries of guys like that. That's interesting that the ego, the male gaze is immediately threatened. And so you can't think in a patient, calm way of how the tech could evolve. Speaking of which, you're a 96 book, The Future of Women. I think at the time and now, certainly now, I mean, I'm sorry, maybe at the time, but I'm more cognizant of now, is extremely relevant. You and Nancy Ramsey talk about four possible futures of women in science and tech. So if we look at the decades before and after the book was released, can you tell a history, sorry, of women in science and tech and how it has evolved? How have things changed? Where do we stand? Not enough. They have not changed enough. The way that women are ground down in computing is simply unbelievable. But what are the four possible futures for women in tech from the book? What you're really looking at are various aspects of the present. So for each of those, you could say, oh yeah, we do have backlash. Look at what's happening with abortion and so on and so forth. We have one step forward, one step back. The golden age of equality was the hardest chapter to write. And I used something from the Santa Fe Institute, which is the sandpile effect that you drop sand very slowly onto a pile and it grows and it grows and it grows until suddenly it just breaks apart. And in a way, me too has done that. That was the last drop of sand that broke everything apart. That was a perfect example of the sandpile effect. And that made me feel good. It didn't change all of society, but it really woke a lot of people up. But are you in general optimistic about maybe after me too? I mean, me too is about a very specific kind of thing. Boy, solve that and you solve everything. But are you in general optimistic about the future? Yes, I'm a congenital optimistic. I can't help it. What about AI? What are your thoughts about the future of AI? Of course I get asked what do you worry about? And the one thing I worry about is the things that we can't anticipate. There's going to be something out of left field that we will just say, we weren't prepared for that. I am generally optimistic. When I first took up being interested in AI, like most people in the field, more intelligence was like more virtue. What could be bad? And in a way, I still believe that, but I realized that my notion of intelligence has broadened. There are many kinds of intelligence and we need to imbue our machines with those many kinds. So you've now just finished or in the process of finishing the book that you've been working on, the memoir. How have you changed? I know it's just writing, but how have you changed the process? If you look back, what kind of stuff did it bring up to you that surprised you looking at the entirety of it all? The biggest thing, and it really wasn't a surprise, is how lucky I was. Oh my, to have access to the beginning of a scientific field that is going to change the world. How did I luck out? And yes, of course, my view of things has widened a lot. If I can get back to one feminist part of our conversation, without knowing it, it really was subconscious. I wanted AI to succeed because I was so tired of hearing that intelligence was inside the male cranium. And I thought if there was something out there that wasn't a male thinking and doing well, then that would put a lie to this whole notion of intelligence resides in the male cranium. I did not know that until one night Harold Cohen and I were having a glass of wine, maybe two, and he said, what drew you to AI? And I said, oh, you know, smartest people I knew, great project, blah, blah, blah. And I wanted something besides male smarts. And it just bubbled up out of me, Lex. And I, what? What's this? It's kind of brilliant, actually. So AI really humbles all of us and humbles the people that need to be humbled the most. Let's hope. Oh, wow. That is so beautiful. Pamela, thank you so much for talking to me. Oh, it's been a great pleasure. Thank you.","label":1}
{"text":"Photo Credit: KOCO\u2019s Abigail Ogle\n\nThis photo is an absolutely brutal and visceral testament to the carnage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I admire the courage of she who shared it with the world in the name of awareness and realism. Our news outlets relate stories about hospitals at capacity and thousands of Americans dying every day, but the broader media ecosystem is so concerned with churning out loaded headlines for clicks that they never take the time to humanize the information and put a face to the statistics.\n\nAs a result of this depersonalization, many travel in direct opposition to holiday guidelines, fail to quarantine when necessary, or gather maskless indoors in large groups without considering the potential ramifications of their actions.\n\nWith the mainstream media abdicating its responsibility to communicate the negative fallout resulting from deviant behaviors, their empty words dilute the warnings of those battle in vain and attempt to convey the seriousness of following health protocols, but who lack the cultural persistence of our entertainment news outlets. Disinformation and anti-intellectualism play roles with regards to fostering, shaping, and guiding this behavior, no doubt, but our American media conglomerates are also failing in their duties due to a persistent inability to engage in critical self-reflection, coupled with their groveling to the cult of the almighty click. Rather than yet another vapid story relating how \u201c[Some Person] BLASTS [Other Person] for [Action or Thing]!!!\u201d, it is imperative that our ostensibly-trusted media outlets display the visceral damage the virus has wrought, the havoc it is wreaking, and the long-term damage it will continue to do as hospital systems nationwide reach and\/or exceed their critical capacity; anything less is a fundamental abdication of its role as the Fourth Estate in American society.\n\nCulturally, Americans are afraid of death and shun it \u2014 it is for precisely this reason, then, that we should be subjected to images and stories like this every day to make us feel uncomfortable, to exploit this cultural taboo. We are more divided than ever as a country and as a society now in life, but there is no unifier greater than the inevitability of our demise. We should pivot away from discussions of statistics and arguments over executive orders and speak instead in the visceral language and imagery of loss and death.\n\nPhoto Credit: BBC\u2019s Brian Lee Hitchens\n\nThe media must tell us these stories and show us these pictures, broadcasting them far and wide: I implore that they not interview another male on oxygen at some backwater hospital who was a COVID denier but now warns people it is real for the 900th time. This approach doesn\u2019t work, sadly, as the legions of obstinate deniers don\u2019t care because he is still alive to confess his sins.\n\nInstead, news programs should show the volunteer healthcare worker who is gasping her last agonal breaths, leaving behind family and friends because her hospital was overwhelmed and she lacked proper PPE. The media should broadcast the 50-something year old marathon runner dying in an ER entryway because the hospital didn\u2019t have room for him two days prior and sent him home, only for his daughter to drive him there again after it was too late. The media must televise brutal reality \u2014 statistics are easy to gloss over if you don\u2019t contextualize them or parse them out, and emphasizing the lasting side effects cannot overcome the politicization of the virus.\n\nA reframing of the narrative through the lens of the great unifier might give those who so cavalierly tout the low mortality rate of the virus (but are scared to the bone by death) pause before they do something selfish and\/or stupid. It might make them further question the intentions and actions of people like Kristi Noem or Mitch McConnell when they refuse sensible fiscal aid packages or the codification of safety measures to keep the capitalist machine running. It might be the only thing that can handhold many of these Americans to the realization that Trump has been gaslighting them about this and untold other things for years. It might further bring about their realization we are all humans sharing a common reality, as bleak and dark as it is right now.\n\nIn what may prove a great irony, the only way to unite the country towards a common purpose in life might be by embracing death. The media must show us these images and videos and share these stories, exposing us to death rather than insulating us from it.","label":0}
{"text":"One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change. And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835. In 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper in New York City. And it cost about 500 dollars to start it, which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today. By 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing \u2014 starting what was experienced as a mass\u2014circulation daily paper \u2014 would come to cost two and a half million dollars. 10,000, two and a half million, 15 years. That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net. And that's what I want to talk about today, and how that relates to the emergence of social production. Starting with newspapers, what we saw was high cost as an initial requirement for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation between producers \u2014 who had to be able to raise financial capital, just like any other industrial organization \u2014 and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of things that this industrial model could produce. Now, the term \"information society,\" \"information economy,\" for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening today, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy. It's just been industrial, which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph, and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe. And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned, depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years. Now, let me tell you a different story. Around June 2002, the world of supercomputers had a bombshell. The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer \u2014 the NEC Earth Simulator \u2014 taking the primary from the U.S., and about two years later \u2014 this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer's capable of running \u2014 sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator. All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period, there's another supercomputer running in the world \u2014 SETI@home. Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working, by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data coming from radio telescopes. What this picture suggests to us is that we've got a radical change in the way information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become less capital intensive \u2014 that there's less money that's required \u2014 but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens, is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies, has one of these, or something rather like it \u2014 a computer. They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network. And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of practically every connected person \u2014 and these are the basic physical capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture, in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet. What this means is that for the first time since the industrial revolution, the most important means, the most important components of the core economic activities \u2014 remember, we are in an information economy \u2014 of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else, are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation capacity in the hands of the entire population, and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience \u2014 the other major experience, the other major input \u2014 which unlike simple labor \u2014 stand here turning this lever all day long \u2014 is not something that's the same or fungible among people. Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances. In that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input into production as we hold this machine. What's the effect of this? So, the story that most people know is the story of free or open source software. This is market share of Apache Web server \u2014 one of the critical applications in Web-based communications. In 1995, two groups of people said, \"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!\" One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided, you know, we really need this, we should write one, and what are we going to do with what \u2014 well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it. The other was Microsoft. Now, if I told you that 10 years later, the motley crew of people, who didn't control anything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market and was the red line, it would be amazing! Right? Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right? But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent, including the major e-commerce site \u2014 70 percent of a critical application on which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue \u2014 in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net. Software has done this in a way that's been very visible, because it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web. So, NASA, at some point, did an experiment where they took images of Mars that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components, put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface, will actually spend five minutes here, 10 minutes there, clicking. After six months, 85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote, \"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,\" once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average. Now, if you have a little girl, and she goes and writes to \u2014 well, not so little, medium little \u2014 tries to do research on Barbie. And she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias. This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition, including, \"manufacturers\" \u2014 plural \u2014 \"now more commonly produce ethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie.\" Which is vastly better than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com, which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter) On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article \u2014 and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here \u2014 but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written, including the controversies over body image and commercialization, the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc. Another portion is not only how content is produced, but how relevance is produced. The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look \u2014 originally, not anymore \u2014 we hire people to look at websites and tell you \u2014 if they're in the index, they're good. This, on the other hand, is what 60,000 passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project, each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about, to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers, each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output, it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social and psychological motivations to do something interesting. This is not only outside of businesses. When you think of what is the critical innovation of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing \u2014 the decision about what's relevant \u2014 to the community of the Web as a whole, doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank. The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying which is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you, people out there on the Web, for whatever reason \u2014 vanity, pleasure \u2014 produced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up. And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly, Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object, which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list. So, all of that is in the creation of content, of relevance, basic human expression. But remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials \u2014 our PCs \u2014 we share them together. We also see this in wireless. It used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an area, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property. What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices, and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle: When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages; and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours. And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security. If in 1999 I told you, let's build a data storage and retrieval system. It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world. It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files, armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years. It would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing. Right? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally, it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people, for very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and their storage to create something. So, essentially what we're seeing is the emergence of a fourth transactional framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which you could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based; they could be decentralized, or centralized. The price system was a market-based and decentralized system. If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them, you had firms, if you wanted to be in the market \u2014 or you had governments or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market. It was too expensive to have decentralized social production, to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself. That was, in fact, economic. But what we're seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange. Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other, as social beings. We do it all the time. It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact. What characterizes them is decentralized authority. You don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system. May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share, if they want to, by themselves or with others, because property is one mechanism of coordination. But it's not the only one. Instead, what we see are social frameworks for all of the critical things that we use property and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are interesting problems; who's available and good for something; motivation structures \u2014 remember, money isn't always the best motivator. If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends, you don't increase the probability of being invited back. And if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter) It also requires certain new organizational approaches. And in particular, what we've seen is task organization. You have to hire people who know what they're doing. You have to hire them to spend a lot of time. Now, take the same problem, chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial. Five minutes, instead of watching TV? Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun. Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations. So, a new social phenomenon is emerging. It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition. Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry; free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft; Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms; Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias. But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses. As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging, you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers. Instead of building well-behaved appliances \u2014 things that you know what they'll do in advance \u2014 you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values, a new set of things people value. You build platforms for self-expression and collaboration. Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project, you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model. And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right? You have a belief: stuff will flow out of connected human beings. That'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone. I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary \u2014 that's what Google does, essentially. That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well. So, social production is a real fact, not a fad. It is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet. Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient because of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person, the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast. But \u2014 and this is the dark lining \u2014 it is threatened by \u2014 in the same way that it threatens \u2014 the incumbent industrial systems. So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision, a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical. It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other, and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced. Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes, or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model, and change the way we begin to see the world and report what it is that we see.

I usually do full ad reads here, I never ads in the middle, but this time, I'll just go straight to the conversation with a bit of guitar first. Shiny Ogre by Putty Do you ponder your mortality? Are you afraid of death? I do think about it sometimes. I mean, it does pop into my head sometimes. Just the fact that, I mean, I'm 53. So if everything goes great, I have less than 50 years left. If everything goes great, like no car accidents, no injuries. But it could happen today. This could be your last day. Could be. That's kind of a stoic thing to meditate on death. There's a bunch of philosophers, Ernest Becker and Sheldon Solomon. They believe that death is at the core of everything. Wrote this book, Warm at the Core. So does that come into play in the way you see the world? I think having a sense of urgency is very beneficial and understanding that your time is limited can aid you greatly. I think knowing that this is a temporary time, that we have finite life spans, I think there's great power in that because it motivates you. It gets you going. I think being an immortal, living forever would be one of the most depressing things, particularly if everybody else was dying around you. And I think one of the things that makes life so interesting and fascinating is that it doesn't last. You know, that you really get a brief amount of time here. And really by the time you're just starting to kind of figure yourself out who you are and how not to screw things up so bad, like time's up. The ride's over. What about from your daughter's perspective? Do you think about the world we're in now and what kind of world you're going to leave them? I do. And do you worry about it? I do. Yeah, I do. I see these protests and riots and chaos and so much anger in the world today. And then particularly today, I think because of the pandemic and the fact that so many folks are out of work and through no fault of their own and can't make ends meet and these people feel so helpless and angry, it's a particularly divisive time. It's a particularly turmoil filled time. And it just doesn't seem like the world of a year ago even, it feels very chaotic and dangerous. And it's a small thing in terms of the possibilities of things that could happen to the world, like a pandemic, the one we've experienced, it really just doubles the amount of deaths on a bad flu year. So relatively speaking is a small thing in comparison to super volcano eruptions, asteroid impact, a real horrific pandemic or one that really wipes out millions and millions of people. It's stunning how fragile civility is. It's stunning how fragile our society really is that something like this can come along, some unprecedented thing can come along and all of a sudden everybody's out of work for six months and then everybody's at each other's throats. And then politically everyone's at each other's throats. And then with the advent of social media and the images that you can see with the videos of police abuse and just racial tensions are an all time high to a point where like if you asked me just five or six years ago, like have racial problems in this country largely been alleviated, I'd probably say, yeah, it's way better than it's ever been before. But now you could argue that it's not. Now you could argue it's no, it's way worse in just a small amount of time. It's way worse than it's ever been during my lifetime while I'm aware of it. Obviously when I was a young boy in the 60s, they were still going through the civil rights movement but now it just seems very fever pitched. And I think a lot of that is because of the pandemic and is because of all the heightened just tension. One I liken it to is road rage because people have road rage not just because they're in the car and no one can get to them, but also because you're at a heightened state because you're driving fast and you know you're driving fast. You know you have to make split second movements. And so anybody doing something like, what the people go crazy because they're already at an eight because they're in the car and they're moving very quickly. That's what it feels like with today with the pandemic. It feels like everybody is already at an eight. So anything that comes along, it's like light it all on fire, you know, burn it down. Like that's part of what I think is part of the reason for a lot of the looting and the riots and all the chaos. It's not just the people out of work, but it's also that everyone feels so tense already and everyone feels so helpless. And it's like, you know, doing something like that makes people, it just, it gives people a whole new motivation for chaos, a whole new motivation for doing destructive things that I've never experienced in my life. And your better days when you see a positive future, what do you think is the way out of this chaos of 2020? Like if you visualize a 2025, that's a better world than today. How do we get there and what does that look like? It's a good question. I can honestly say I don't know. And I wouldn't have said I don't know a year ago. A year ago, I would have said, we're going to be okay. As much as people hate Trump, the economy is doing great. I think we're going to be fine. That's not how I feel today. I don't think there's a clear solution politically because I think if Trump wins, people are going to be furious. And I think if Biden wins, people are going to be furious. Particularly like if things get more woke, you know, if people continue to enforce this force compliance and make people behave a certain way and act a certain way, which seems to be a part of what this whole woke thing is, that is the most disturbing for me is that I see what's going on. I see there's a lot of losers that have hopped on this and they shove it in people's faces and it doesn't have to make sense. Like there was a Black Lives Matter protest that stopped this woman at a restaurant. They were surrounding her outside a restaurant. They were forcing her to raise her fist in compliance. This is a woman who's marched for Black Lives Matter multiple times and the people all around her doing this were all white. It's all weird. My friend Coach T, he's a wrestling coach, is also on a podcast. My friend Brian Moses, his take on it is that black and he's a black guy. He says Black Lives Matter is a white cult. And I'm like, when you see that picture, it's hard to argue that he's got a point. I mean, it's clearly not all about that, but there's a lot of people that have jumped on board that are very much like cult members. Because the thing about Black Lives Matter or any movement is you can't control who joins. There's no entrance examination. So you don't go, okay, how do you feel about this? What's your perceptions on that? Like the man who shot the Trump supporter in Portland, that guy who murdered the Trump supporter and the cop shot him. That guy was walking around with his hand on his gun looking for Trump supporters. He's a known violent guy who was walking around looking for Trump supporters, found one and shot one. That has nothing to do with Black Lives Matter. He's a white guy. He shot another white guy. It's just madness. That kind of madness is disturbing to see it ramp up so quickly. There's been riots in Portland every night, oh, excuse me, demonstrations for 101 days now, 101 days in a row of them lighting things on fire, breaking into federal buildings. It's like, who ever saw that coming? Nobody saw that coming. So I don't know what the solution is and I don't know what it looks like in five years. So 2025, to answer your question, it could be anything. We could be looking at Mad Max. We could be looking at the apocalypse. We could also be looking at an invasion from another country. We could be looking at a war, like a real hot war. To put a little bit of responsibility on you, for me, I've listened to you since the Red Band, Olive Garden days, the very beginning. There was something in the way you communicated about the world, maybe there was others, but you were the one I was aware of, is you're open-minded and loving towards the world, especially as the podcast developed. You just demonstrated and lived this kind of just kindness or maybe even lack of jealousy in your own little profession of comedy. It was clear that you didn't succumb to the weaker aspects of human nature and thereby inspire people like me, who I was naturally, probably especially in the early 20s, kind of jealous on the success of others. And you're really the primary person that taught me to truly celebrate the success of others. And so by way of question, you kind of have a role in this of making a better 2025. You have such a big megaphone. Is there something you think you could do on this podcast with the words, the way you talk, the things you discuss that could create a better 2025? I think if anything, I could help in leading by example, but that's only going to help the people that are listening. I don't know what else I can do in terms of like make the world a better place other than express my hopes and wishes for that and just try to be as nice as I can to people as often as I can. But I also think that I've fallen into this weird category, particularly with the Spotify deal where I'm one of them now. I'm not a regular person anymore. Now I'm like some famous rich guy. Until you go from being a regular person to a famous rich guy that's out of touch. And that's a real issue whenever you're talking about the economy, about just real life problems. It's interesting. It kind of hurts my heart to hear people say about Elon Musk. He's just a billionaire. Yeah. It's an interesting statement. But I think if you just continue being you and he continue being him, people, I think people are just voicing their worry that you become some rich guy. I don't even know if they're doing that. I think they're just finding the way he describes it, an attack vector. Right. Yeah. And I think he's right. I think they could dismiss you by just saying, oh, you're just a that. You're easily definable. Right. But there's truth to that. If you're not careful, you can become out of touch. But that's an interesting thing. Why haven't you become out of touch? As a human off the podcast, you talk to somebody like me. You don't talk like a famous person or you don't act rich. You're better than others. Listen, I've talked to quite a few. You have too, but I've talked to a special kind of group of people that are Nobel Prize winners, let's say. They sometimes have an air to them that's of arrogance and you don't. What's that about? Well, you got to know what that is. That air of arrogance comes from drinking your own Kool-Aid. You start believing that somehow or another, just because you're getting praise from all these people, that you really are something different. Usually it exemplifies there's something there where there's a lack of struggle. I think struggle is probably one of the most important balancing tools that a person can have. For me, I struggle mentally and I struggle physically. I struggle mentally in that we were talking about on the podcast we did previously, you and I on my podcast said, I'm not a fan of my work. I'm not a fan of what I do. I'm my harshest critic. Anytime anybody says something bad about me, I'm like, listen. I said way worse about myself. I don't like anything I do. I'm ruthlessly introspective and I will continue to be that way because that's the only way you could be good as a comedian. There's no other way. You can't just think you're awesome and just go out there. You have to be picking apart everything you do, but there's a balance to that too because you have to have enough confidence to go out there and perform. You can't think, oh my God, I suck. I know what I'm doing, but I know what I'm doing because I put in all that work. One of the reasons why I put in all that work is I don't like the end result most of the time, so I need to work at it all the time. Then there's physical struggle, which I think balances everything out. Without physical struggle, I always make the analogy that the body is in a lot of ways like a battery where if you have extra charge, it leaks out of the top and it becomes unmanageable and messy. That's how my psyche is. If I have too much energy, if I'm not exerting myself in a violent way, like an explosive way, like wearing myself out, I just don't like the way the world is. I don't like the way I interface with the world. I'm too tense. I'm too quick to be upset about things. But when I work out hard and I put in a brutal training session, everything's fine. Well, the first time I talked to you on JRE, you were doing Sober October and there's something in your eyes. I think you've talked about that you exercise the demons out essentially, so you exercise to get whatever the parts of you that you don't like out. There's a darkness in you there, the competitiveness and the focus of that person. That was a scary time in a lot of ways, that Sober October thing. My friends, we were all talking shit because we're competing against each other in these fitness challenges. You got a certain amount of points for each minute that you went at 80% of your max heart rate. One day I got 1,100 points. I did seven hours on an elliptical machine watching the bathhouse scene from John Wick where he murders all those people in the bathhouse. I watched it probably 50 times in a row. I went crazy. I went crazy, but I went crazy in a weird way where it brought me back to my fighting days. It was like that person came out again. I was like, well, I didn't even know he was in there. It's like an assassin, like a killer. I felt like a different person. Is it echoes of what Mike Tyson talked about essentially? But no orgasm. No emotions. All the crazy shit that he was saying. Is there a violent person in there? Oh yeah. There's a lot of violence in me for sure. I don't know if it's genetic or learned or it's because during my formative years from the time I was 15 until I was 22, all I did was fight. That was all I did. That was all I did. All I did was train and compete. That was all I did. That was my whole life. Is it connected to... Your mom and dad broke up early on. Is it connected to the dad at all? I'm sure it's connected to him also because he was violent and it made me feel very scared to be around him. But I also think it's connected in who he was as a human is transferred into my DNA. I think there's a certain amount of... I mean, to be prejudiced against myself, I look like a violent person. If I didn't know me, even the way I'm built, not even just the working out part, just the size of my hands and there's the width of my shoulders. There's most likely a lot of violence in my history, in my past, in my ancestry. I think we minimize that with people. So much of your behavior... When I see my daughter, I have one daughter that's obsessive in terms of she wants to get really good at things and she'll practice things all day long and it's 100% my personality. She's me in female form, but without the anger as much and without the fear. She has a loving household and everything like that, but she has this intense obsession with doing things and doing things really well and getting better. What's the point? We have to tell her, stop doing handsprings in the house. Stop, stop. Come on, just sit down, have dinner. One more, one more. She's just like, she's psycho. I think there's a lot of behavior and personality and a lot of these things are passed down through genetics. We don't really know. We don't know how much of who you are genetically is learned behavior, nature or nurture. We don't know if it's learned behavior or whether or not it's something that's intrinsically a part of you because of who your parents were. I think there's certainly some genetic violence in me. And then you channeled it. Yeah, I channeled it. So you figured out it's basically your life is a productive exploration of how to channel that. Yes. How to figure out how to get that monkey to sit down and calm down. There's another person in there. There's a calm, rational, kind, friendly person who just wants to laugh and have fun. And then there's that dude who comes out when I did Sober October. That guy's scary. I don't like that guy. That guy just wants to get up in the morning and go. When I was competing, it was necessary, but it makes me remember. I didn't really remember what I used to be like until that. When I'm working out seven hours a day and just so obsessed and all I was thinking about was winning. That's all I was thinking about. If they were working out five hours a day, I wanted them to know that I was going to work out an extra three hours and I was going to get up early and I was going to text them all, hey, pussies, I'm up already. Take pictures, send selfies. I was like, you're going to die. I kept telling them, you're all going to die. You try to keep up with me, you're going to die. You weren't fully joking. No, I wasn't joking at all. That's what was fucked up about it. That's the scary thing when I interacted with Goggins and what I saw in you during that time is this guy, this is why I've been avoiding David Goggins recently. He wants to meet, he wants to talk on this podcast, but he also wants to run an ultra marathon with me. I felt like this is a person, if I spend any time in this realm, if I spend any time with the Joe Rogan of that sober October, I might have to die to get out. There's this kind of- Yeah, there's a competitive aspect that's super unhealthy. You saw the video that we watched earlier today of Goggins draining his knee. That would stop me from running ever again because I would think in my head, okay, I'm going to ruin my cartilage. I'm going to need a knee replacement. I would start thinking, I would go down that line, but he is perpetually in this push it mindset. What he calls the dog in him. That dog is in him all day long and he feeds that dog. That's who he is. That's one of the reasons why he's so inspirational and he's fuel for millions and millions of people. I mean, he really is. He motivates people in a way that is so powerful, but it can be very destructive. I know now, especially after the sober October thing, that that thing's still in me. I didn't know, so I really haven't done anything physically competitive, except one time I was supposed to fight Wesley Snipes. It came out then too. That came out too. That got creepy too, but luckily that never happened. That was many months of training, like training twice a day, every day. Kickboxing in the morning, jujitsu at night. I was just going and going and going and going and I was just thinking just all day long. It fucks with all the other aspects of your life. It fucks with your friendships, it fucks with my comedy, it fucks with everything. That mindset is not a mindset of an artist. It's a mindset of a conqueror. The conqueror, yeah, the destroyer. That's why it's so interesting to see Mike Tyson make the switch. It's clear that whatever that is, however that fight goes, there's a switch. He stepped into a different dimension. Roy Jones Jr. is coming on my podcast soon and Roy's going to be on before the fight. I'm so curious to see how it goes down, but genuinely concerned because Mike Tyson is a heavyweight and Roy Jones at his best was 168 pounds. I don't know if Roy has that room in his house, mental house of where Mike Tyson goes. I don't know. I don't know if he has that room. Mike doesn't have a room. He's got an empire in there. He opens up the door. With tigers. He opens up the door. There's a whole empire in his head and he's in that firmly. When he got out of the weed and started training again, you could see it in him. By the way, physically, in person, he looks spectacular. He looks like a fucking Adonis. He looks ready to go. It's crazy. Yeah, watching videos of him. What about you? Have you ever considered competing in Jiu Jitsu? No, for that very reason. I don't want to get obsessed. That's my number one concern. I had to quit video games when we were playing video games at the studio. I had to quit because I was playing five hours a day out of nowhere. All of a sudden, I was playing five hours a day. I was coming home late for dinner. I was ending podcasts early and jumping on the video games and playing. I get obsessed with things and I have to recognize what that is and these competitive things, competitive, especially really exciting competitive things like video games. They're very dangerous for me. The ultimate competitive video game is Jiu Jitsu. If I was young, I most certainly would have done it. If I didn't have a very clear career path, it was something that I enjoyed. My concern would be that I would become a professional Jiu Jitsu fighter when I was young and then I would not have the energy to do standup and do all the other things that I wound up doing as a career. When I was 21, I quit my job teaching. I was teaching at Boston University. I was teaching Taekwondo there. I also had my own school in Revere. I knew I couldn't do it right and also be doing standup comedy. I knew I couldn't do both of those things. There was no way. You have to be cognizant of that obsessive force within you to make sure. Yes. I have to know how to manage my mental illness. That's a very particular mental illness. I think that mental illness, again, my formative years from 15 till I was 21-ish, 22, those years were spent constantly obsessed with martial arts. That was my whole day. I trained almost every day. The only time I would not train is if I was either injured or if I was exhausted, if I needed a day off, but I was obsessed. That part of my personality that I haven't nurtured is always going to be there under the surface. When it gets reignited by something, it's very weird. It's a weird feeling. It can get reignited with a video game. It can get reignited with anything, that obsessive, whatever it is, that competitive demon. Yes. The way you talk about guitar, I know you would fall in love with playing guitar, but I think you're very wise to not touch that thing. That's why I want golf. I have friends who want to golf. I'm like, I don't fucking want that thing. A lot of people ask me, what's Joe Rogan's Jiu Jitsu game like? Knowing that I somehow spend hours rolling with you before and after we drag. You should at some point show a technique or something. That would be fun. Sure. I've got this technique online. What's your game like? I saw you doing I think head and arm, something online. Yeah. I fucked my neck up doing head and arm chokes. I did them so much that because you use your neck so much with head and arms chokes, I developed a real kink in my neck and it turned out I had a bulging disc. So you're doing on that just one side? Well, no, I could do it on the left side, but I definitely am better on the right side. The right side was my best side. If you were to compete, let's say, what's your A game? Where would you go from standing up? How would you go to submission? Would you pull guard? Would you take down? How would you pass guard? I don't have good takedowns. I was not a good wrestler. I would most likely either pull guard or I would pull half guard. Do you have a good guard? Yes. Are you comfortable being on your butt and your back? Yes. I'm very flexible. My rubber guard is pretty good. You go to rubber guard. Yeah. I have good arm bars and good triangles off my back. I also have a very good half guard, but my top game is my best. I have a very strong top game. You have a half guard. Do you have a preference of what kind of guard and how to pass that guard? Is there a specific game plan? Double underhooks from half guard is the game plan for me. If I can get double underhooks from half guard, I could sweep a lot of people. Underhooks of what? Sorry, the arms or the legs? Half guard, lockdown. Lockdown, got it. Half guard, go into lockdown, double underhooks. Got it. Clinch to the body, suck the body. Just pressure. Yeah, massive pressure. Then inch my way into a position we call the dog fight. Inch my way to a position where I could get the person on their back. Yeah, because you did show me I still disagree with you about the tie thing. The tie? That you can choke somebody with the tie. So wrong. So wrong. Well, it's not wrong with you. With you, it's wrong because you- No, I think there's a system. I have this thing down here. We're going to figure it out. Okay. Let's have a little Velcro on the back. See, you're just not the- You're not the- you're the exec, that's cheating. Yeah, I did feel when you showed me, I think you showed me the rubber guard because it's still a guard. That's a little bit foreign to me. I just felt that you can immediately feel, not with the rubber guard, but the way you move your body is you're like a Shange type of guy who knows how to control another human being. So some people are a little bit more, I would say, agile and playful and kind of- Loose. Loose and they work on transition, transition, transition. You're a control guy. You know how to control position and advance position. Donnie Heard is the same way. He's all about control. My game is smush. That's my game. Smush you. Grab ahold of you. Once I have you, why would I let you go? My thought is why would I let you go? I just want to incrementally move to a better position until I can strangle you. But I'm much more into strangling people than anything else. Which is a great MMA approach for Jiu-Jitsu. Well, too many people don't tap when you get their arms. And I'm not opposed to arm bars. I love arm bars, but everybody goes to sleep. And quit from pressure too. I mean, quit mentally. There's nothing like that. You can't breathe. If you've got a guy who's like a really good top game guy and he mounts you, and I'm a big fan of mounting with my legs crossed, like a guard, like a top guard. And so I can squeeze with both legs. Smush. And I'm just looking for people to make mistakes and slowly incrementally bettering my position until I can get something locked up. I love Jiu-Jitsu though, man. I just wish it didn't injure you. Jiu-Jitsu is like, if your joints were more durable, they could figure out a way to make joints more durable. God, I could do Jiu-Jitsu forever. It's so much fun. I actually, I talked to this roboticist, Russ Tedrick. He builds, he's one of the world-class people that builds humanoid robots. You're interested in Boston Dynamics. He's one of the key people in that kind of robotics. So I asked him the stupidest question of like, how far are we from having a robot be a UFC champion? And yeah, it's actually a really, really tough problem. It's the same thing that makes somebody like Danielle Cormier, like on the wrestling side special, because you have to understand the movement of the human body in ways that's so difficult to teach. It's so subtle. The timing, the pressure points, the leverage, all those kinds of things. That's just for the clinch situation. And then the movement for the striking is very difficult. As long as you're not allowed as a robot to like use your natural abilities of having a lot more power. Right. A lot more power and then more durable. Right. And the human body, like especially meniscus, like you see the heel hook game, like everybody's involved in leg locks and heel hooks. Like all those guys wind up with torched knees. Everyone's got torched knees. Everyone's knees are torn apart and you don't grow new meniscus. That's like one of those joints where, man, when it goes, those guys are 28 years old of blown out knees. Let me ask the ridiculous question. What do you think? We're talking about cops. What do you think is the best martial arts self-defense? For sure, jiu-jitsu. Yeah, for sure. Wrestling? I think grappling, I should say. Judo as well, especially in a cold climate. If you get someone who's got like a heavy winter jacket on, my God, like Judo is an incredible martial art. Plus concrete. That's the worst place to be with a heavy winter jacket with a Judo specialist and you're standing up with them. Oh my God. But I think grappling, because in most self-defense situations, it usually winds up with grappling. You're definitely better off though, knowing some striking because there's nothing more terrifying than when you go to take someone down, they actually have takedown skills, but they can fight. And so they have takedown defense and they know how to fight and then you don't know how to stand up. The worst thing in the world is seeing someone reaching who doesn't know how to do striking and someone cracks you. What about all that Krav Maga talk, which is like the whole line of argument that says that Jiu-Jitsu and wrestling and all of these sports, they fundamentally take you away from the nature of violence. So they're just teaching you how to play versus the reality of violence that is involved in like a self-defense situation that is a totally different set of skills would be needed. In general, the people that say that Jiu-Jitsu or other martial arts, it's more of a sport and they don't really understand violence. In general, the people that say that suck. Anybody who thinks like someone's like, hey man, I'll just bite you. I'm like, are you going to bite me? Okay. Do you think I'm going to bite you too? What do you think of that? What if I punch you in your fucking face? You think you're still going to bite me when you can't even see? You barely even know you're alive and I choke you unconscious. If someone's really good at Jiu-Jitsu, good luck stabbing them with your keys. You don't have a chance. You don't have a chance. If someone's much better, they trip you and get you on your back and then they fucking elbow you in your face and get a head and arm choke on you. All that crap magashas out the window, son. You're way better off learning what works on trained killers. This whole idea that you're going to poke someone in the eye and then you're going to kick them in the nuts. You're going through these drills that yeah, it's good to know what to do if you run into someone who doesn't know how to fight. It's way better to know what to do to someone who knows how to fight. That's the best thing. Learn how to fight against people who know how to fight. All that practice self-defense and they're going to come at you with a knife. You're going to grab the wrist and do that. It's good to know self-defense, but it's much more important to understand martial arts comprehensively. When you understand martial arts comprehensively, there's no Krav Maga guys, but it would be shocking if a Krav Maga guy and a mixed martial arts guy had a fight and the mixed martial arts guy who's a trained killer all around didn't fuck that guy up. That's what I would expect would happen. I would not think that some guy who has a little bit of this and a little bit of that and prepares for the streets is going to be able to handle a person who trains with killers on a day-to-day basis, who rolls with Jiu-Jitsu black belts, who trains with Muay Thai champions. The best martial arts are the martial arts that work on martial artists, not the martial arts that work on untrained people. What about, we're in Texas now, what about guns? Well, that's the best martial art. No, but would you, in this crazy time, should people carry guns? It's not a bad idea to have a gun because if you need a gun, you have a gun. If you don't need a gun, if you're a person with self-control, you're not going to use it. You're not going to just randomly use it, but you have something to protect you. This is the whole idea of the Second Amendment. The whole idea of the Second Amendment gets distorted by mass shootings or by terrible people who murder people and do terrible things. All those things are real, but they don't take away from the fundamental efficacy of having a firearm and defending your family or defending your life. There are real live situations where people have had firearms and it's protected them or their loved ones or they've stopped shooters. There's many of these stories, but people don't like those stories because then it tends to lead to this gun culture argument, this pro-gun culture argument that people find very uncomfortable. Human beings are messy. We're messy in so many different ways. We're messy emotionally. We're messy physically, but we're also messy in what's good or bad. We want things to be binary. We want things to be right or wrong, one or zero, and they're not. But there is crime in the world. There is violence in the world, and you're better off knowing how to fight and you're better off knowing how to defend yourself and you're better off having a gun. I generally think that guns, I do like the idea that guns, Second Amendment helps protect the First Amendment. There's a sense that puts me at ease knowing that so many people in this country have guns that, I mean, Alex Jones, I just listened to one episode of Infowars for the first time. Boy, he reminds me like when I drank some tequila, I felt like I'm going to some dark places today. That's how I feel like listening to him. But he talks about that he worries about martial law. So basically government overreach by, which happened throughout history. There's something to worry about there, but it puts me at ease knowing that so much of the population has guns that people, government would think twice before instituting martial law in cities. But I actually was asking almost on the individual level. I maybe shouldn't say this, but I don't yet own a gun. And I felt that if I carry a gun, statistically, just for me as a human, knowing my psychology, I feel like I'm more likely to die. Like, I feel like I would put myself in situations that I shouldn't. The way I will see the world will change. Really? Because my natural feeling is like when somebody, when I was in Philly and I knew late at night in West Philly, when some guy looks at you, you can immediately calculate that this is a dangerous human being. It starts with a monkey look at first, like I'm a bigger monkey than you. And that's where I found like, for example, I'll do the beta thing of just looking down and turning away and just getting out of trouble, like very politely. And basically that kind of approach, because if you have a, in terms of getting out of serious violence situations, like serious, something where you could die versus if I had a gun, I feel like I would want to be, that there would be that cowboy monkey thing where I would want to put myself in situations where I'm a little bit of a savior, even of myself and almost create danger, which can no longer, like the escalation of which I can no longer control. Well, you're talking about taking a gun somewhere versus having a gun in your home. Yes, yes. I mean, carry on me. That's a different situation and much harder to get a warrant or a license for that. Control concealed carry licenses, especially in Massachusetts. They don't come easy. Oh, Massachusetts. Yeah, that's a whole nother thing. Yeah. You're saying gun in the home. Yeah, gun in the home. Having a gun, knowing how to use a gun. I know how to use a gun. I've trained many hours learning how to shoot a gun at tactical places. There's a bunch of videos of me doing it on Instagram. I practice and I think it's good to understand how to be accurate. So I've been a fan of your podcast for a long time. You don't often talk about it because you're always kind of looking forward, but if you look at the old studio that you just left, is there some epic memories that stand out to you that you almost look back, I can't believe this happened? Oh yeah. Almost too many of them to count. Is there something that pops into mind now? All of them. Elon Musk blowing that flame thrower in the middle of the hallway. I got a video of that. Have you ever seen the video of it? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you posted on Instagram. I think I did too. Yeah, he's a madman. Having Bernie Sanders in there, just all the fun fight companions we did and all the crazy podcasts with Joey Diaz and Duncan Trussell. There were so many. There were so many moments. This is a weird art form and it almost seems like, it sounds silly, but it almost seems like something that chose me rather than I chose it. I think of that all the time in some strange way. It's like I'm showing up as an antenna and I just plug in and twist on and then I take in the thing and I put it together and I'm like a passenger of this weird ride. Yeah, you've talked about this before. I really like this idea that human beings are just carriers of these ideas. Ideas are the ones who are breeding. In a sense, the idea found you as a useful brain to use to spread itself through the podcasting medium. When I think about your podcast, I think about Joey Diaz. I think about all those comedians you've had. I think you've had Joey on maybe close to 50 times, 60, some crazy number. He is over the top offensive. Just that's who he is to the core. Is there some sense where you wondered whether it's right to have the Spotify episode number one with Duncan Trussell for five hours? No. I wanted to do it that way. That's why we wore NASA suits and we got high as fuck. That's the whole idea behind it. Can you introspect that a little bit? What is that? Because that's rare. It's such a rare thing to do because you're not supposed to talk to Duncan Trussell with a huge platform that you have five hours. Why not? Because Donald Trump apparently watches your podcast. That's the idea that there's these... That's what I think about these CEOs write to me that they listen to the podcast that I do. I have somebody like a David Fravor and I was nervous about it. I was nervous to have a conversation. For me, David Fravor is a Duncan Trussell, which is like... Just because of his experiences with UFOs. Yeah. Even just the way he sees the world because he is open. I don't know if he's always like this, but he opened himself to the possibility of unconventional ideas. Most people in the scientific community say, well, I don't really want to believe anything that doesn't have a lot of hard evidence. That was to me like a step. As the thing somehow becomes more popular, there becomes this fear of like, well, should I talk to this person or not? You're an inspiration in saying, do whatever the hell you want. You have to. First of all, I have what you call fuck you money. If you have fuck you money, you don't say fuck you. What's the point of having the fuck you money? You're wasting it. You're wasting the position. Someone said to me, why do you like sports cars so much? How many cars do you have? A bunch of cars. Because if I was a kid and I said, hey, if I was that crazy rich famous guy, I don't want to have a bunch of cool fucking cars. So I would do that because not everybody gets to do that. If you're the person that gets to do that, you're kind of supposed to do it. If you want to, if that really does speak to you. I've talked to you about this before, muscle cars, specifically ones from the 1960s and the early 70s, they speak to me in some weird way, man. I could just stare at them. I have a 65 Corvette. I walk around it sometimes at night when no one's around. I just stare at it. What's your favorite muscle car? What's your most badass late 60s, the perfect car? Probably that car, probably that 65 Corvette. 65 Corvette. I walk around it when no one's around. I think I've driven the 69 Corvette. Is there a particular year that just- 65 is generation two, 69 is generation three, 69 it's even more curvy. They're both awesome, just awesome in different ways. But I just love muscle cars for whatever reason. But the point is I like what I like and if I can do what I want to do, I should do what I want to do. And it's not hurting anybody. And the thing is I would do the Duncan podcast if no one was listening. If we were just starting to do a podcast together and no one cared and it got like 2000 views, which we did for years, I would do it with Duncan and we would get high and we'd talk crazy shit about aliens and spaceships and maybe dude, maybe ideas are living life forms and they're inside your head and that's how things get made. Man. Yeah, man. I just kind of morphed me and him together in that because the life form idea, life form idea is mine that I really think about a lot. I think about it on a technical side, by the way. When I heard you say that, because I've been thinking, I was like, whoa, that's interesting. They might be alive because I don't know what the fuck they are, but when someone has an idea for whatever, an invention, a toaster, and then they think about this, all it needs is like these heating elements and a spring and then it pops when it's done. So I have a timer and then they build this thing. Now all of a sudden it's alive. It's like you manifested it in a physical form. Toaster is not the best example, but a car, an airplane, you're thinking about a thing, like an idea comes into your head and you can say, oh, well, it's just creativity. It's a part of being a person. That's how we invented tools and how we became better hunters. All those things are true. I'm not saying that there's some magic to what I'm saying, but there's also a possibility that we're simplifying something by saying that it's just creativity, that it's just a natural human inclination to invent things. Why? Is it possible that ideas like creativity, like we are the only animal other than there's a few species that create things like bees, make beehives, but they're very uniform. You know, some animals use tools, you know, like chimps will use like sticks to get termites and things like that. But there's something about what we do that it makes you wonder because we look at this skit, just look at this room that we're in, look at all these electronics, look at all this crazy shit that human beings have invented and then built upon others' inventions and proved and innovated. These all came out of ideas. Like the idea, it germinates in someone's head, it bounces around, they write it down, they share it with others, the other people who have similar ideas or ideas that are complementary, they work together and they change the world. And the new thing in that is the idea is not the people. It's like we think we found the ideas, but it's more like the ideas found us. Find you, yeah. They're literally in the air. They come to you. I always felt like that with bits. Like when I come up with a bit, that's why I'm always telling people about the Steven Pressfield book, The War of Art, because he talks about respecting the muse and the idea that your ideas come when you sit down and you do the work or you sit down like a professional and you talk to the muse. Like, come tell me what to do. Like if the muse was a real thing, as if a muse is like some mystical creature that comes and delivers you ideas. Even if that's not real, that's how it works. It does work like that. If you do treat it like it's a muse and you treat it with the respect and you treat it like a professional, the ideas do come to you. I never thought about what he's doing is just sitting there waiting for the idea that's trying to breed to find him. Yeah. That's a trippy thing. If you show up and put in the time and focus your energy on that, the ideas, they will arrive. And that's the same with writing comedy. Like there's been many, many times where I'll come home from the comedy store and I just sit down and I start writing and I just, I've got nothing. There's nothing there. I'm just writing. It's all bullshit. Nothing's good. It's just like, hmm. And then all of a sudden, bam, there's the idea. And then all of a sudden I can't stop. And then a couple of hours later and I'm like, whoa. And then the next night I'm on stage and I'm like, how about that? Boom! It gets this big laugh. I'm like, holy shit. And I know that came out of the discipline to sit down and call the muse. I mean, the cool thing is the ideas have found you to like, oh, I'm going to use this dude. Like he seems to have a podcast that's popular. I'm going to breathe inside his brain and spread it to others. It's the same as- Or an inventor. I'm going to use this guy who's like desperately seeking some sort of a product to bring to market. Some guy who wants to invent things is thinking about inventing things all the time. These ideas, they weasel their way into your head. And it seems to me also that the frequency that your mind operates under has to be correct. Because one of the things about creativity seems to be if you think about yourself a lot, if you're really into yourself or your image or you're selfish, those ideas, they don't find you. Yeah, that's funny. The ideas- It stifles the creative. Yeah, yeah. Yes. It's the opportunity that the idea has for defining. Yes, which is one of the reasons why joke thieves, people that steal jokes are terrible writers. There's never like really good writers who are also joke thieves. It's just joke thieves and then when they have to write on their own, if they get exposed, they become terrible comedians. They're a shadow of what they were when they were stealing other people's ideas. Because the thing that would make you steal a person's idea is that ego part, like the wanting to claim it for yourself, the wanting to be the man or the woman. I want to be the person who gets out there and says it and everybody's going to love me for it. You can't think like that and be creative. It requires a humility and it requires a detachment from self in order to create. When I'm writing, I'm blank. I'm just staring. The part of my mind that's active is not like me. It's like this weird core function part where I'm not aware of my personality. I'm not aware of anything. I'm just trying to put it together in a way that I know works. Just being there, being present. That's the press field. I'm a big believer just sitting there, even staring at a blank page, just putting in the time. Yeah. Sometimes it's not that way. Sometimes it's an inspiration. Sometimes I'll be sitting there at dinner and I'll be like, I got an idea. My wife's really cool about that. I'm like, I have an idea and I have to just run out of the room real quick and I write it down on my phone and then I can come back. Because those are like little gifts that you get sometimes from the universe out of nowhere. Some people rely only on those gifts. I've talked to comics about it. They're like, I can't come up with my best ideas when I don't write. I'm like, no, I do too. I come up with great ideas when I don't write, but I also write. You can do both of those things. They're not mutually exclusive. You mentioned fuck you money. I feel like I have fuck you money now. A year ago I was at zero. I have fuck you money now because probably my standard is my, I don't need much in this world, but because also probably because of you, but it's 300 to 400,000 people listen to every episode I do. That's a lot. That is weird. That's a successful television show on cable. Yeah, it's crazy. It's all you. That's hilarious. That's amazing. But at this point that also resulted in a few money in a sense that I don't, I don't need anything else in this world. By way of asking, I've looked up, you've inspired me for a long time. Do you have advice? You've done this on the podcast side of life. Do you have advice for somebody like, for me and somebody like me going on this journey? Eric Weinstein is going on this journey. Is there advice, both small and big that you have for somebody like me? The advice is to keep doing what feels right to you and do what you're doing. Obviously, it's resonating with people if you're getting that big of an audience. I've listened to your podcast. You're very good at it. Just keep doing it the way you're doing it. Don't let anybody else get involved. What about, you've connected. I think you met Jamie at the Comedy Store. I met him at the Ice House. At the Ice House? Ice House. I think I met him at the Comedy Store, but then we talked at the Ice House. You'd have to ask him. Did you think deeply about, because you basically have nobody on your team. It almost feels like a marriage. Were you selective about somebody to bring into your little circle? Well, Jamie's exceptional. He is. He's a special. I don't remember how he was in the early days, maybe you could say. He's definitely better at it, but right away, he's exceptional. He's got very little ego. He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention. He's not a guy who overestimates anything in terms of negative or positive. His interpretation of whether it's good things that happened to the show or bad things that happened to the show, he just takes it all flat. He's chill. He's just cool as fuck, and he's so smart, and he's so good as an audio engineer and as a podcast producer. He's the best. He's basically one of the only people on this whole team. How do you find, when you let people in... I'm sure other people wanted to get involved. Why don't you have a co-host? You basically kind of... Well, here's the problem with a co-host. When you and I are talking, when we're talking, I'm tuned in to you, and I'm waiting to hear what you're saying, and I'm listening, and I'm interpreting it, and then I'm calculating whether or not I have anything to say, whether to let you keep talking, whether I maybe have a question that lets you expand further, or whether I have a disagreement. There's a dance that's going on. Now, when there's another person there chiming in too, it fucks the dance up. It's like dancing. If you're doing a dance with someone, like if you're slow dancing with someone, and then a third person's there stepping on everybody's feet. Sometimes it's fun. Sometimes having a third person is fun. Comedy podcasts, sometimes it's fun. Debate- Fight companions. Kind of structured. Yeah, debate structures, but even then it gets difficult because people talk over each other. Also, I find that without headphones, it's way easier to talk over each other. You make mistakes. You don't hear it the same way. When you have headphones, I hear what you hear. It's all one sound, and the audience hears exactly, or rather, I hear exactly what the audience hears. Whether it's over here, my voice is louder than yours because you're over there, and if I don't have headphones on, it's not all together. On that point, one of the interesting things about your show is you almost never have done, and you generally don't do remote, sorry, not remote calls, but you don't go to another person's location. I've only done a few, a small handful. And just like, well, this is a Paul Ski. He should do this, but I actually- I would love to. We went back and forth on email. I told him he needs to get his ass back in the studio. He's working on a book. I was a fan of his a long time ago because I became obsessed with toxoplasmosis. I've reached out to him a long time ago before he was willing to do it, but then I caught him in downtown LA. He was there for something else, and I just greedily snatched up an hour of his time. Well, he doesn't get, I think, some of those folks don't get how much magic can happen in this podcast studio, bigger than anything they've ever done in terms of their work. Not talking about reach, but in terms of the discovery of new ideas. There's something magical about conversation. Nobody as brilliant as him, if he gives himself over to the conversation for multiple hours at a time, that's another place where you've been an inspiration. Where I'm getting more and more confidence of telling people, like Elon Musk, that a lot of CEOs are like, well, he has 30 minutes on his schedule. I'm like, no, three hours. And then they're like, so some say no, and then they come back. There's people that started coming back to like, okay, we're starting to get it. They start to get it. And you're a rare beacon of hope in that sense, that there is some value in long form. They think that nobody wants to listen for more than 30 minutes. They think like, I have nothing to say. But the reality is, if you just give yourself over to like the three hours, just let it go. Three hours, four hours, whatever it is. There's so much to discover about what you didn't even know you think. Yeah. Yeah, you have to be confident that you could do it. And in the beginning, I just did it because that's what I wanted to do. And no one was listening. So I've always been a curious person. So I've always been interested in listening to how people think about things and talking to people about their mindset and just expanding on my own ideas, just talking shit. And so we would have these podcasts and they would go on forever. And my friend Ari, I never let him die, never let this die down. Never let him forget this. He was always like, you have to edit your podcast. I'm telling you right now, you're fucking up. I go, why? He's like, because people are not going to listen to it. I go, they don't have to. Yeah. I go, you listen to part of it. He goes, just do it. I'm telling you, trust me. Put it down to like 45 minutes. It's all you need. And I'm like, no, no, I don't think you're right. I like listening to long form things. No one has that kind of time. I go, okay, I'm just going to keep doing it this way. And it sticks to your gut. No, he doesn't. His are like two and a half hours long now. That's great. You won. But you wouldn't like say, I mentioned to you this before, this is going to happen. It's actually made a lot of progress towards it. I'm going to talk to Putin, but you wouldn't travel to Putin if you want to talk to you? Putin is a dangerous character. He's not. Have you ever seen the thing with Jerry Kraft where they stole his Super Bowl ring? Yeah. Yeah. I think that was a little bit of misunderstanding. Oh, really? I think it's a little bit, he just decided he's going to steal that Super Bowl ring. Kind of. I think it was a- Kind of. Can I see your ring? He shows him his ring and then he puts it on and says, I can murder somebody with this ring. And then he walks off with it. It's possible he did it. He's a big believer in displays of power. Yeah. So it's possible he did that, but I think he sees himself as a tool with which to demonstrate that Russia still belongs on the stage of the big players. And so a lot of the actions are selected through that lens. But in terms of a human being, outside of any of the evils that he may or may not have done, he is a really thoughtful, intelligent, fun human being, like the wit and the depth from the JRE perspective is really interesting. I'm like his manager now selling. He's a judo guy. Trying to get Trump. He's really good at judo. I have seen him practice judo. He's a legit black belt. And not only that, he loves it, not just skill-wise, but to talk about it, to reason about it, to think about it, to MMA as well. So it'd be a good conversation. But you wouldn't travel to him. Well that's hold to your principles. So that's the core of the advice. Just hold to whatever- I would rather... Here's the thing. There's not a person that I have to have on the show. And I'm happy to talk to anybody. I'm just as happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Trump, probably more happy to talk to you as I am to talk to Mike Tyson, as I am to talk to Joey Diaz. I like talking to people. I enjoy doing podcasts. I enjoy talking to a variety of people and I schedule them based on... I try not to get too many right-wing people in a row or too many progressive people in a row. I don't want to get repetitive. I try not to get too many fighters in a row. I try to balance it out. Not too many comedians. Comedians are the one group where I can have three, four in a row, five in a row, because that's my tribe. Those are my people. It's easy. We can talk about anything. It's a weird dance. The conversations that you're doing on a podcast, they're a strange dance and you want to not step on your own feet and you want to make sure that you do it in a way, do the podcast in a way that's entertaining for people. Conversations are learning how to talk to people. It's a weird skill. It's a weird skill that took a long time for me to get good at and I didn't know it was a skill until I started doing it. I just thought you're just talking. I was just, I know how to talk. We'll just talk to people. Then along the way, I realized, oh... Then when you talk to people that are bad at it, you realize that it's a skill. Particularly one of the things about my people, about comedians, is a lot of them tend to want to talk but don't want to listen. They're waiting for you to stop talking so they can talk but they're not necessarily thinking about what you're saying. They're just waiting for their opportunity or they talk over you. I try real hard not to do that and sometimes I fail but when I'm at my best, I'm dancing. Yeah, ultimately the skill of conversation is just really listening. Listening and thinking. Listening and thinking and being genuinely curious and really having a take on what they're saying and maybe a follow-up question or maybe... It's got to be real. It's got to be authentic. When it is authentic and it's real, it resonates with people. They're listening and they go, oh, I'm locked in with the way you're thinking. You two guys are in a conversation and I'm locked in. When she talks and you listen, I'm listening too. When he says something to her or when she says something to him, there's a thing that happens during conversations where you're there. You're listening to... With me, when I listen to a good podcast, I feel like I'm in the room. I feel like I'm in the room and I'm like the friend that got to sit down and listen. I go, yeah, it's a great conversation. I love conversations. I love listening to them and I love putting them together. The fact that this podcast has gotten so fucking big, it's stunning to me. It blows me away. I never anticipated it. Never thought for a second that that stupid thing that I used to do in my couch, in my office was the biggest thing I've ever done in my life by far. People used to make fun of it. There's a Comedy Store documentary that's coming out and one of the parts of the documentary is my friend Tom Segura, when he first started doing my podcast, he would be leaving and he would talk to Red Band. He's like, what the fuck is he doing? Why is he doing this? Who's listening? He's like, oh, some people like it. It's like fucking nonsense, waste of time. In the documentary, it shows 2,000 views, one of the early Ustream episodes. It's hilarious. They don't just like it. They form a friendship with you. Even me, when people come up to me, the love in their eyes is kind of beautiful. It's weird, right? Yeah. You're part of their life. Yeah. I don't know, it's also heartbreaking because you realize you'll never really get to know them back because they clearly are friends with you. Yes. Yeah. It's sad to see a person who's clearly brilliant and interesting and is friends with you, but you don't get a chance to return that love. My kids, it took them a while to figure out what's going on, but people would come up to me and they would say something like, hey man, I fucking love you. Thanks man. All right. Hey brother, nice to meet you. My daughter was like six. She'd be like, do you know him? I'm like, no, I don't know him. She's like, how does he know you? It's very weird conversation I used to have with young kids when I'd explain, I'd do this thing called the podcast and millions of people listen. Now one of my daughters is 12 and one of her friends is 13 and he's a boy and he goes to school with her and he's obsessed with me. She's weirded out and she says to him, I don't even think you like me. I think you're just into my dad, you fucking weirdo. She's going to have that conversation in a few stages in her life. That hard conversation with a boyfriend. Yeah, probably. Yeah. That's the thing about men too. This podcast is uniquely masculine. I'm a man and I'm also a man that doesn't have to go through some sort of a corporate filter. I'm not going through executive producers who tell me don't have this guest on, don't talk about that. We looked at focus groups and they don't seem to like when you do this. There's none of that. I just do it. I have a whole podcast where I just talk about cars and people are like, I don't want to hear you talk about cars. Well, good. Congratulations. You found what you like. Here's good news. There's 1500 other ones. Go listen to the other episodes where I don't talk about cars. You don't have to listen. It's not like your brand, you just are who you are and that's what you do. It's authentically what I'm interested in. All the podcasts, whether I'm talking to David Fravor about his experience with UFOs, whether I'm talking to David Sinclair about life extension, whether I'm talking to you about artificial intelligence or what, it's because I want to talk to these people and that resonates. I like when people are into shit. I've talked about this before, things that I have no interest in making furniture, but I like this PBS show where this guy makes furniture by hand. I love watching it. Craftsman. Because he's so into it. He's sanding this and polishing that. I'm not going to do that. I don't give a fuck about furniture. Furniture for me is function, like this desk. Function works, but I love when people are into it. I'm happy that someone can make it and they do a great job, but I'm not interested in the task or even the finished product as much as I'm interested in someone's passion for something. The passion that they've put into this, that shines through. Last question. I sometimes ask this just for, what is it, to challenge, to make people roll their eyes, to make legitimate scientists roll their eyes. I ask, what is the meaning of life, according to Joe Rogan? I do not think there is a meaning. I think there's many, many meanings of life. I think there's a way to navigate life that's enjoyable. I think it requires many things. It requires, first of all, it requires love. You have to have loved ones, you have to have family, you have to have friends, you have to have people that care about you, and you have to care about them. I think that is primary. Then it also requires interests. There has to be things that stimulate you. Now, it could be just a subsistence lifestyle. There's many people that believe and practice this lifestyle of just living off the land and hunting and fishing and living in the woods, and they seem incredibly happy. There's something to be said for that. That is an interest. There's something, and there's a direct connection between their actions and their sustenance. They get their food that way. They're connected to nature, and it's very satisfying for them. If you don't have that, I think you need something that is interesting to you, something that you're passionate about. There's far too many people that get sucked into living a life where you're just doing a job, you're just showing up and putting in your time and then going home, but you don't have a passion for what you're doing. I think that's a recipe for a boring and very unfulfilling life. You mentioned love, if we could just backtrack. We talked about the demons and the violence in there somewhere. What's the role of love in your own life? It's very important, man. It's one of the reasons why I'm so interested in helping people. I'm very interested in people feeling good. I like them to feel good. I want to help them. I like doing things that make them feel like, oh, you care about me. Yeah, I care about you. I really do. I want people to feel good. I want my family to feel good. I want my friends to feel good. I want guests to feel good about the podcast experience. I'm a big believer in as much as I can to spread positive energy and joy and happiness and relay all the good advice that I've ever gotten, all the things that I've learned. If they can benefit people, then I find that those things benefit people and actually improve the quality of their life or improve their success or improve their relationships. I'm very happy to do that. That means a lot to me. The way we interact with each other is so important. It's one of the reasons why someone gets canceled or you get publicly shamed. It's so devastating because there's all these people that negative, all this negative energy coming your way and you feel it. As much as I like to pretend that you're immune to that kind of stuff and some people do like to pretend that, you feel it. There's a tangible force when people are upset at you. That's the same with loved ones or family or anytime someone's upset at you, whether it's a giant group of people or there's a small amount of people. That has an impact on you and your psyche and your physical being. The more you can spread love and the more love comes back to you, you also create this butterfly effect where other people start recognizing like, oh, when he's nice to me, I feel better and then I'm going to be nicer to people. When I'm nicer to people, they feel better and I feel better and it spreads outward. That's one thing that I've done through this podcast, I think, is I've imparted my personal philosophy in kindness and generosity to other people. To correct you, you didn't do it. The ideas that are breeding themselves through your brain have figured out- Yes, the ideas that are alive in the air have made their way into my head. Love is a more efficient mechanism of spreading ideas they figured out. Yes. Probably, man. Probably. As far as the meaning of life, without that, you have nothing. One of the biggest failures in life is to be extremely successful financially, but everybody hates you. Everybody hates you and you're just miserable and alone and angry and depressed and sad. When you hear about rich, famous people that commit suicide, wow, you missed the mark. You got some parts right, but you put too many eggs in one basket. You put too many eggs in the financial basket or the success basket or the accomplishment basket and not enough in the friendship and love basket. There's a balance to that. When I talked about the violence and all that stuff, that to me is me understanding recognizing that is me trying to achieve that balance. It's to go kill those demons so that this boat is level because if it's not, then the boat is like this and then everything's all fucked up and every time we hit a wave, things fall apart. Pass that boat out, figure it out, know who you are. Some people don't have that problem at all. Some people, they could just go for walks and they're cool as a cucumber. I need more. I need kettlebells. I need a heavy bag. I need the Echo bike, the air assault bike. I need some hardcore shit and if I don't get that, I don't feel good. I figured that out too and that makes me a nicer person and that makes my interactions nicer. It changes the quality of my friendships and my relationships with people. I think we mentioned Neuralink. I can certainly guarantee that this is one of the memories I'll be replaying 20, 30 years from now once we get the feature ready. Joe, it's a huge honor to talk to you. It's an honor to talk to you too, man. I'm glad you came down here for this. The first week of me doing this here and it's very cool to have you always. I hope you make Texas cool again and do your podcast for another 10, 11, whatever, however many years you're still on this earth. All right. Thank you, brother. Appreciate you, man.

{"text":" 1.\t  The delegation of Liberia extends heartiest congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the thirty-sixth session of the Assembly. We note that you bring to your onerous responsibility not only sterling leadership qualities but also more than two decades of experience in the United Nations system.\n2.\tOur sincere thanks and appreciation go to your illustrious predecessor, Mr. Riidiger von Wechmar, for the services he so ably rendered the Organization. Much was expected of him, and much was received.\n3.\tWe also wish to thank the SecretaryGeneral for his continuing efforts in guiding the activities of the United Nations in the pursuit of international peace and security.\n4.\tPermit us to add to the words of welcome that have been extended to Vanuatu and Belize upon their advent to membership in the Organization. We wish their people well as they embark upon the task of nation building. We look forward to the day when all peoples and countries under alien domination can exercise their inalienable right to self-determination, freedom and independence.\n5.\tWhen we appeared before the Assembly at the thirty- fifth session [13th meeting], we did so at the advent of a revolutionary process. We were privileged to give an overview of this process and to explain its causes and effects. As we appear before you once again, we wish to underscore some of our achievements thus far.\n6.\tIt is pleasing to note that the revolution has not departed from its original objectives. Consistent with the commitment of the People's Redemption Council to return power to civilians in the shortest time practicable, a Constitutional Commission, clothed with special privileges and immunities, has been mandated to draft a constitution by which Liberia can return to civilian control and democratic institutions.\n7.\tConcomitantly, the Government of Liberia, under the leadership of CommanderinChief Samuel Kanyon Doe, is acting with all deliberate speed to effect progressive changes in the quality of life of our people and relieve the problems which made the revolution not only necessary but inevitable. Our people are motivated by a firm determination to resolve the problems which beset Liberia: 90 per cent illiteracy; cultural alienation; an economy which produces what we do not consume, while we consume what it does not produce; an inadequate health delivery system; 53 per cent unemployment within the active labor force; and a pattern of corruption which was bequeathed to the people by the erstwhile princes of privilege.\n8.\tIt may be recalled that the People's Redemption Council inherited a bankrupt treasury with an overdraft of $11 million, along with external indebtedness amounting to more than $700 million. However, with perseverance and tenacity, we have rescheduled our loans abroad, formulated a development plan and, with the assistance of IMF, worked out a stabilization program to set the basis for economic recovery.\n9.\tCommanderinChief Samuel Kanyon Doe and the People's Redemption Council have also engaged in the summary release from detention of former officials of Government who were charged with high treason and rampant corruption. By this act of magnanimity our people have been spared the trauma of protracted trials which could have invoked disturbing memories of the past and thereby detracted from the process of national reconciliation. The prisons have been rendered virtually empty.\n10.\tWe have gathered here, as we have done for 35 years, to engage in our annual review of developments in the world today.' After these many years of our collective wisdom, there is still polarization of the many nations of the world. Mighty nations seem adrift, and the spectre of a nightmare now looms larger than the prospects for peace. Lurking in the hearts and minds of many of us in this Hall are designs and schemes of war against our neighbors. The world is today consumed by mounting problems: an arms race, food shortages, an energy problem and a range of economic ills inflation, unemployment, protectionism, low levels of capital formation and unstable commodity markets.\n\n11.\tIn our domestic settings, many Governments have created oppressive circumstances which inhibit men from living and acting as men circumstances 'which blind men to their goals, prevent them from taking measures to free themselves and militate against the vision and boldness of the human spirit.\u2003\n12. Implicit in the search for peace over the past 35 years have been two basic convictions: first, that the cooperation of the great Powers would condition the environment in which peace could be preserved and security guaranteed; and, secondly, that Member States, as a matter of commitment, and therefore honor, would strictly adhere to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\n15; These conditions have never been met, and many high hopes in the Charter have proved to be most disappointing. Instead of cooperation, we see rivalry and disagreement among the great Powers; instead of strict adherence by all Member States to the Charter, nonconformity is common; and instead of progressive steps towards global cooperation and unity, we find Member States preoccupied with parochial concerns to the exclusion of the collective interest. We see the United Nations, which ought to be the conscience of mankind, being reduced to a# arena for peaceful war or a warlike peace  pax bellicosa, bellum pacificum. Each year we all cry 'Peace, peace', but there is no peace.\n14.\tIf we are to succeed in attaining our common goals and aspirations, we must develop a sense of community. We must forge cooperative partnerships and work together meaningfully to discuss and solve our common problems. These are the high principles to which the Government of Liberia is committed and it is within the broad context of these principles that we now turn to specific issues on our agenda.\n15.\tWe welcome the designation of 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons. We believe that the dedication of a year to the disabled will contribute to public understanding of disability and emphasize the need for rehabilitation. To this end, appropriate measures are being designed in Liberia.\n16.\tLiberia's position on decolonization is clear and unequivocal: we reaffirm our solidarity with all colonial countries and peoples, especially the struggling people of southern Africa, who, with the blood of martyrs, are resisting systematic laws of exploitation, discrimination and suppression.\n17.\tLiberia continues to feel that Security Council resolution 435 (1978) has all the attributes for ensuring the independence of Namibia under the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization [SWAPO]. We remain convinced that as long as South Africa can find solace in some quarters of the contact group it will continue to reject the plan for Namibia's independence referred to in that resolution, will increase its repression of the Namibian people and will engage in acts of destabilization and terrorism against Mozambique, Angola and other neighboring States. It was therefore with much relief that we welcomed the brief but unconditional affirmation of the United States commitment to resolution 435 (1978).\n18.\tThe situation in Afghanistan and Kampuchea demonstrates the insecurity of small States of the international community. It also points to the impotence of the Organization in the face of serious threats to the security of small nations. We totally reject and are absolutely opposed to the presence of foreign troops in the two countries and we call for their immediate withdrawal to enable the people to choose their own form of government without outside interference of any kind.\n19.\tDevelopments in Cyprus continue to constitute a threat to international peace and security. We urge due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of that State, and we call for a resumption of the inter-communal talks so that the miseries of that long-suffering people will come to an end.\n20.\tThe international economic outlook continues to be characterized by uncertainty, especially for the developing countries. Many of these countries are faced with mounting unemployment, spiraling inflation, worsening terms of trade, rising protectionism, dwindling sources of financial assistance and overall economic stagnation. Indeed, many of the developing countries are threatened with imminent economic collapse.\n21.\tMembers of the international community, particularly developed countries and oil-producing States, must all strive to rise above the temptation to pursue shortsighted objectives of self-interest at the expense of the wellbeing of the global economy.\n22.\tOur Government welcomes the determined efforts of the United Nations system to rallying Member States to undertake serious discussions and seek solutions to the problems confronting the international economy. We refer specifically to the recent United Nations Conference on New and Renewable Sources of Energy, held at Nairobi, and the United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris this month. In the same vein, we look forward with much anticipation to the forthcoming NorthSouth summit, scheduled to be held in Cancun.\n23.\tLiberia has consistently maintained, and continues to maintain, a Middle East policy based on the following principles: first, that a just and lasting peace cannot prevail in the Middle East without due recognition of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to a State of their own; secondly, that Israel must withdraw completely from all occupied Arab lands; and, thirdly, that all States in the region, including Israel, have a right to live freely within secure and internationally recognized boundaries with the fullest respect for their territorial integrity and sovereignty.\n24.\tWe wish to register our support for Egypt in its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crises in the Middle East. Our sympathy certainly goes to that State which, far from shouting the loudest, pays the highest price, in both men and material, for war in that area of the world. We find nothing intrinsically wrong with partial agreements, and we are convinced that the Camp David agreements represent a meaningful initial approach. We believe Egypt needs the encouragement of men of good will everywhere with a view to achieving a broader and more comprehensive solution.\n25.\tFor our part, we will not permit it to be said of President Sadat as was said in 1874 of Walpole, that 'in vain [he] battled . . . against the cry for war ... He stood alone in his desire for peace.' It may be recalled that Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, took the initiative of issuing a call last year for all States which have severed diplomatic relations with Israel to begin a reexamination of their policy. It may also be recalled that the birth of Israel was the culmination of a United Nations proceeding. Interestingly, too, Liberia cast the deciding vote in 1948 which gave rise to the existence of Israel.\n26.\tWe persist in stimulating public debate on the issue of diplomatic fence-mending because we believe that the increasing estrangement and isolation of Israel undermine the prospects for a peaceful solution to the Middle East problem. Links must exist to facilitate communication. In order to reconcile warring factions, the parties must at least be reached.\n27.\tWhile our own reexamination process has been slow, it has produced some modest results by at least compelling us to concretize our views.\n28.\tWe find that the ostensible reason for the severance of ties with Israel solidarity with Egypt on the matter of the violation of its territorial integrity no longer obtains. Cairo has effected a modus vivendi with Tel Aviv, and Liberians ought not to be more Egyptian than Sadat. Yet there are issues which continue to concern us, and some of them have claimed the attention of the Israeli authorities.\n29.\tWe find disturbing the collaboration between Tel Aviv and Pretoria. It is equally disturbing to be reminded of the open secret that some black African States maintain vibrant and extensive economic links with South Africa. At the same time, it is reassuring to note that an active Jewish community exists in South Africa with strong anti-apartheid sentiments.\n30.\tFurther, considering the close ties of friendship and cooperation which exist between the Lebanese and Liberian peoples, the Government of Liberia was distressed by Israel's recent bombing of Lebanon. We believe such an act undermines the prospects for peace in the area and trust that all parties concerned will henceforth exercise restraint.\n31.\tAnother matter which remains of crucial concern to us is the just cause of the Palestinian people. In the spirit of AfroArab solidarity, we remain irrevocably aligned with them in their struggle. We are therefore awaiting with keen interest the results of the talks on Palestinian autonomy which began in Cairo a few days ago.\n32.\tIn accordance with the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, particularly the principles of self-determination and non-interference in die internal affairs of other States, Liberia believes that the Korean question should be solved through peaceful negotiations between the peoples of North Korea and South Korea. To that end, we call on the SecretaryGeneral to renew his offer made in 1979 to both Seoul and Pyongyang to perform an intermediary role. Furthermore, membership in the United Nations of both North Korea and South Korea should be encouraged to help alleviate tension and create a  favorFable climate for stability. This should be urged without prejudice to the eventual reunification of the Korean peninsula.\n33.\tMany years of hard work and resourcefulness have gone into the formulation of a convention on the law of the sea on the basis of the principle of the common heritage of mankind. Despite significant advances, a final text has yet to be agreed upon. We continue to await a common regulation, universally acceptable, to govern the sea and thereby ensure that its benefits and resources are shared by us all.\n34.\tDespite the many obstacles confronting the United Nations, we believe it has the capacity to bring about a more peaceful, just and equitable world community. However, it requires the highest degree of our understanding, cooperation, dedication and commitment. Let us therefore resolve that each of us will bring to the Organization now and in the years to come the fullest measure of those qualities. In the cause of the people, the struggle continues.\n\n\n","label":1}
{"text":"So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out a little like this. So, you know \u2014 (Laughter) you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil. (Laughter) And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper would come along, and then I would kind of do this. (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. (Laughter) And then \u2014 (Laughter) But then those middle months actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters \u2014 humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters \u2014 sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, \"Is this Tim Urban?\" And I say, \"Yeah.\" And they say, \"We need to talk about your thesis.\" And I say, \"OK.\" And they say, \"It's the best one we've ever seen.\" (Laughter) (Applause) That did not happen. (Laughter) It was a very, very bad thesis. (Laughter) I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought, \"This guy is amazing!\" (Laughter) No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator. (Laughter) Now ... here's my brain. (Laughter) There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine until this happens. [This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, \"Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan\/ Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered that that happened. (Laughter) Then \u2014 (Laughter) Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. (Laughter) \"All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!\" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! (Laughter) And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred \u2014 all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen? Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments \u2014 someone called the Panic Monster. (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past. (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind. He was saying, \"Are we clear on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future? We need to sit down and work on this right now.\" And the Monkey said, \"Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India.\" (Laughter) So that's what we did that day. (Laughter) As six months turned into four and then two and then one, the people of TED decided to release the speakers. And I opened up the website, and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem. (Laughter) And the Monkey \u2014 remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster \u2014 boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me could spend two weeks unable to start the opening sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night and write eight pages. And this entire situation, with the three characters \u2014 this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. (Laughter) And they were all writing, saying the same thing: \"I have this problem too.\" But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing with intense frustration about what procrastination had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind of procrastination that happens in situations when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter \u2014 something in the arts, something entrepreneurial \u2014 there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship that isn't working. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term kind of procrastination that's much less visible and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why those people are emailing, and that's why they're in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming for some project. It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them. So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany \u2014 that I don't think non-procrastinators exist. That's right \u2014 I think all of you are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating on something in life. We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not that many boxes on there, it's a job that should probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... (Laughter) You know. Sometime soon. Thank you. (Applause)","label":1}

{"text":"\ufeffIn accordance with tradition, this year Europe follows Africa in the presidency of the thirty-fifth session of the General Assembly. That is a sign of our times and confirmation of a form of complementarity which, because it is indispensable, calls for close and dynamic co-operation among nations and continents.\n249.\tI am therefore pleased to extend to Mr. von Wechmar the congratulations of my delegation and to greet him as a worthy representative of a friendly country. My delegation assures him of its co-operation, and extends to him our best wishes in the exercise of his exalted functions.\n250.\tI should also like to extend greetings to his predecessor, our brother and my great friend, Mr. Salim Ahmed Salim of the United Republic of Tanzania. My delegation is most grateful to him for having represented our continent, Africa, so successfully. Each time he was called upon to preside over the work of the General Assembly, he gave proof of his competence, modesty and high sense of responsibility.\n251.\tMy delegation warmly welcomes the admission of the Republic of Zimbabwe to the United Nations and wishes to express to the representatives of that new State the friendly feelings of the people of Guinea-Bissau and its profound desire to develop and consolidate the fraternal links of co-operation which unite the people of Zimbabwe with the people of Guinea-Bissau. The heroism, the spirit of sacrifice and responsibility which characterized the national liberation struggle in Zimbabwe augur well for the positive and beneficial contribution which that country will make to the Organization, with the objective of totally liberating southern Africa from the domination of the apartheid regime,\n252.\tIt is also a pleasure for me to welcome Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and to convey to it our best wishes for the progress and prosperity of its people.\n253.\tThe accession to independence of those new States bring us closer to the principle of universality proclaimed by the United Nations and the presence among us today of their worthy representatives comforts us and bears witness to the success of the Organization in its struggle for the liberation of all the peoples of the world,\n254.\tThose successes of the international community are in part the result of the contribution of the Secretary- General and of his very devoted staff. That is why I am happy to congratulate them on behalf of my Government as well as to renew our encouragement for their tireless efforts on behalf of the maintenance of peace in the world.\n255.\tAs everybody knows peace in the world is indispensable for the progress of our peoples because in truth it is all mankind which is threatened with extinction if the deadly rivalries and confrontations we witness and deplore do not give way to understanding and co-operation among nations.\n256.\tThe past year has not registered major progress in the solution of the problems which are faced by the international community. The victory of the freedom fighters in Zimbabwe, it is true, has altered the balance of power in southern Africa and created new hopes in Namibia and South Africa. Despite political assassinations and an intensification of repression, the people of South Africa continue to struggle courageously against the racist and inhuman regime of apartheid. The South African Government seems not to have learned from the victory of the Patriotic Front in Zimbabwe and is striving desperately to invent every kind of subterfuge to lend credence to a new flexibility in its racial policy and a so-called will to change. The persistence of terrorism and oppression nevertheless brings us back to the sad truth, namely, the poverty and the suffering of which the people of South Africa are victims. That is a scandalous fact, the impact of which goes beyond the borders of South Africa to challenge the conscience of every human being. That challenge to the international community would have been taken up more vigorously and more rigorously had the efforts of that community not been weakened by certain complicity which makes difficult, if not ineffectual, the imposition of a total economic embargo against South Africa.\n257.\tThe sanctions decreed against the apartheid regime have not put an end to repression or even attenuated the suffering of the South African people. And yet one still hears cries that racism is inhuman and all vehemently proclaim that they are in favour of equality between races and men, But everyone knows that the South African regime still stands thanks to its close economic relations with Western countries and that its repressive system expands in proportion to the injections of foreign capital the origin of which is also known.\n258.\tIn our opinion it is high time to put an end to soporific hypocrisy. There is an obvious reality which cannot be denied, least of all lengthy speeches and paternalistic acts. Justice will not be restored in South Africa by the consolidation of the South African economy for the benefit of the white population alone or by participation in the exploitation of black workers. Nor will human rights be respected if we close our eyes to the brutal repression practised against the militants of ANC. Nor is it by the looting of Namibia's wealth that the process of achieving the independence of that country will be accelerated. The hearings on uranium here at United Nations Headquarters yielded proof of the true intentions of the transnational corporations, which will stop at nothing to loot the natural resources of Namibia.\n259.\tThe racist regime of South Africa, strengthened by the economic support and complicity of the Western countries, can thus with greater scorn and arrogance defy the international community and further extend its domination over Namibia. Its obstinate refusal to comply with United Nations decisions no longer surprises us, because it continues to find support among international financial groups, as well as attentive ears and generous hands to strengthen its repressive power and domination.\n260.\tEverybody knows that the decision by the racist apartheid regime of 1 July 1980 to transfer power to the members of the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance was a step towards the establishment of a puppet Government entirely under its sway. Furthermore, the fact that South Africa has illegally extended its territorial sea and proclaimed an economic zone along the Namibian coast obviously proves the absurd and deceitful nature of such a step, which is simply the new tactic of the apartheid regime to ensure the perpetuation of its occupation and so to satisfy its Western clients, which are greedy for cheap raw materials.\n261.\tDefying the relevant decisions of the United Nations, the Western countries through the medium of transnational corporations acting on their behalf, are deliberately participating in maintaining the illegal occupation regime, trampling under foot Decree Number 1 for the Protection of the Natural Resources of Namibia, which was adopted by the United Nations Council for Namibia on 27 September 1974. In thus violating the economic and social interests of the Namibian people, the accomplices of the racist apartheid regime are strengthening the latter's repressive power and blocking the process of achieving independence by the Territory. They are preventing the Namibian people from exercising its right to self-determination in accordance with decisions of the United Nations, compelling that people to have recourse to armed struggle as the only alternative to defend its imprescriptible right to freedom.\n262.\tIn the face of the acts of aggression and barbarity by South Africa against the People's Republic of Angola, acts which we vigorously condemn and whose only objective is the destruction of the Angolan economy so as to forestall any logistical support for the freedom fighters, SWAPO has no choice but to intensify its armed struggle. The sole and legitimate representative of the Namibian people, SWAPO cannot participate in the peace process from a position of weakness. Nor will it plan its own suicide by accepting the conditions made by South Africa or by trusting solely in the smooth words of the five Western countries. As with Zimbabwe yesterday, we are witnessing today to the same holding back and the same scenario, in a perfidious attempt to prevent the accession to power of the genuine nationalists grouped within SWAPO and thus to turn aside the course of history and set up a puppet Government in the pay of those who defend apartheid and transnational corporations.\n263.\tThe responsibility of the United Nations in the decolonization process remains and must be assumed in its entirety. The international community must envisage urgent measures capable of putting a final end to South African domination in Namibia. It will only be by applying the enforcement measures provided for in Chapter VII of the Charter against the apartheid regime that we shall see concrete results, The Western countries friendly to South Africa have to assume a double responsibility in that context, which requires, on the one hand, respect for the embargo against the racist regime and, on the other, a constructive contribution to the coming into being in Namibia of democratic power which derives from the people. Any other attitude would undermine the chances for a peaceful solution of the problem and uselessly prolong the war, the victims of which now number in the thousands.\n264.\tRecognized and supported by the United Nations as the authentic representative of the Namibian people, SWAPO is, we know, prepared to participate in the peace process, on the condition that that process take into account the interests of the Namibian people and that it have no objective other than the satisfaction of its legitimate aspirations to true independence.\n265.\tOn the other hand, the SWAPO fighters remain opposed to any proposal for a solution which does not respect the real facts of the problem and which does not envisage an alternative to the establishment in Namibia of a puppet regime under the sway of the racist apartheid regime and its Western allies. In that they will enjoy, as in the past, the complete support of the international community, including that of my country, Guinea-Bissau.\n266.\tThe recognition today of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic by more than 40 States Members of the United Nations is the result of an obstinate struggle born of courage and sacrifice. It shows that the strength of a people cannot be gauged solely by the number of cannon or aircraft in its possession. In a war of national liberation, more than any other, it is motivation which matters and is therefore more important than the technical quality of weapons. The knowledge that he is defending so noble a cause gives each freedom fighter an incalculable dimension to his person. One can then understand why the militants of POLISARIO show so much courage and endurance and why they are able to strike such deadly blows against the enemy.\n267.\tAfrica, seasoned by its experience of struggle against colonialism, is opposed to Morocco's policy in Western Sahara. The OAU declared itself in favour of the self- determination of the Sahraoui people and has for several years sought to find a peaceful way to solve this conflict. We know that such a solution must include withdrawal of the Moroccan troops from Western Sahara and recognition of the Sahraoui Arab Democratic Republic as an expression of the will of the people of that area.\n268.\tThat is what the OAU Ad Hoc Committee on the question of Western Sahara advocated on the basis of irrefutable facts and taking into account the opinion of the vast majority of African Governments.\n269.\tIn the meantime, current Chairman of the Assembly of the OAU, Mr. Siaka Stevens, in his statement before the Assembly, which was remarkable, faithfully reflected the desire of his peers, the eminent African heads of State, to see the Moroccan Government return to the path of wisdom and renounce its policy of expansion by recognizing the Sahraoui people's right to self-determination in accordance with the principles of the Organization and in the interest of peace and harmony in the region.\n270.\tIn Chad, the war continues despite the repeated appeals for a cease-fire made to the opposing factions. The OAU, as everyone here knows, has for several months been working hard to find a solution to this conflict which sets the descendants of a same people separated by often irreconcilable political ambitions against one another. It is difficult, in a situation which plunges Africa into mourning, to refrain from mentioning the lack of wisdom of the leaders of Chad. The unnecessary suffering of their people should have induced them to show a greater sense of responsibility.\n271.\tIn this fratricidal war, how far, it may well be asked, can anyone claim to be defending the interests of a people and at the same time take part in their destruction? The people of Chad must regain its balance and strength in order to build its future, and the political groups or factions contending for power know this and should take it into account because they certainly cannot wish to govern a ruined, soulless and lifeless country.\n272.\tOn behalf of my Government, I should like to invite my brothers in Chad to make every effort to consolidate that which unites them rather than to widen further the gap that divides them. The leaders of Chad should use their intelligence for the benefit of their people to reject any foreign interference, regardless of its source, the effect of which is to undermine their unity and cause the death and destruction of their people.\n273.\tApart from the material destruction and innumerable victims caused by this armed conflict, there is the problem of the refugees and displaced persons created by any war situation. It is estimated that today there are 5 million of these unfortunate people in Africa, 5 million human beings fleeing death in tragic circumstances and compelled to live more often than not in indescribable poverty. This state of affairs, already alarming in the Horn of Africa, is today aggravated by the massive flow of refugees from Chad and Uganda into neighbouring countries, which are trying hard to help them.\n274.\tHere we must congratulate the African countries which have given succour to these refugees in spite of the material and financial problems that such action implies, and also to thank the Governments and organizations which, in a show of international solidarity, have helped to ease the sufferings of all those unfortunate people.\n275.\tThe continued conflicts in Africa and their harmful effects on the development of our continent is of concern to African States and to the international community in general, It is, indeed, the upheavals in that continent that directly affect international peace and security. Conversely, the rivalries between the great Powers, in particular when reflected in the installation of foreign military bases, gravely threaten the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of our young States.\n276.\tThe situation in the Indian Ocean is alarming for a number of reasons, and the present difficult international situation has confirmed the gravity of a state of affairs which the United Nations wished to prevent by adopting General Assembly resolution 2832 (XXVI), the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace. My country, being perfectly aware of the dangers threatening the coastal States of the Indian Ocean and world peace, understandably supports our Organization's efforts to bring that about and welcomes with interest President Ratsiraka's proposal that an international conference be convened in Madagascar for the purpose of creating, in a common effort, conditions which would ensure the success of the Conference on the Indian Ocean to be held at Colombo in 1981. We are all the more pleased to lend our support to the initiative of the Malagasy head of State, since in our opinion it is based on a clear perception of the problem and stems from a sincere will to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.\n277.\tWhile it is true that the seventh emergency special session devoted to the question of Palestine enables us correctly to assess the support of the international community for the Palestinian cause, it is nevertheless undeniable that we have become increasingly aware of the injustice from which the Arab people of Palestine has been suffering for decades. The General Assembly, by convening that special session, intended certainly to unblock a situation created in the Security Council by one of its permanent members whose abuse of the veto is inadmissible. But it was intended, above all, to offer an exceptional opportunity to the international community to expose the real enemies of the freedom of peoples.\n278.\tThere has for several years been unanimous agreement on the aggressive and expansionist nature of Israel's policy. We can therefore expect the United Nations to do more that simply adopt resolutions. It could, for example, take concrete and effective steps to break Israel's obstinacy and arrogance.\n279.\tOn the eve of the twentieth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of resolution 1514 (XV) on the inalienable right of every people to choose its own destiny, it is both inadmissible and regrettable, that Member States upon which their power confers special political and moral responsibilities, can endorse and encourage Israel's policy of occupying Arab territories and denying the Palestinian people their right to exist. It is dishonourable to proclaim oneself the defender of human rights and to ignore the elementary rights of millions of Palestinians.\n280.\tThe Palestinian people should, like any other people, be able to enjoy its right to be free and to create an independent State. It is common knowledge that any solution of the Middle East crisis, to be viable and final, must meet this essential requirement. The events of the last two years have shown that any attempt to reach a partial settlement that does not take this reality into account is doomed to failure. The PLO, which represents the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, must be brought into any peace negotiations for it would be absurd to ignore the political, military and moral force it represents if one sincerely intends to help establish peace and stability in the Middle East.\n281.\tThe international community should draw its inspiration from the principles stated in the Charter of the United Nations and take measures capable of promoting Israel's withdrawal from the Arab territories occupied since 1967 and the recognition of the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to live freely in a sovereign State. The urgent application of these measures, as provided for under Chapter VII of the Charter, is today essential as a means of curbing Israel's inhuman policy in the occupied Arab territories and to break the Israeli Government's ill-advised arrogance. That Government has once again defied the United Nations by deciding to make of Jerusalem the capital of the Israeli State, The gravity of such a decision which, bearing in mind the importance of the Holy City of Jerusalem for the three major monotheistic religions, constitutes a real sacrilege, must be clear to all. The United Nations must compel the Government of Israel to respect the faith of millions of believers whose contribution, at least moral if not political, is essential if world peace is to be safeguarded.\n282.\tThe repeated Israeli aggressions against Lebanon constitute yet another flagrant violation of that country's independence and territorial integrity. My Government strongly condemns them and wishes to reiterate to the G government and people of Lebanon its brotherly feelings of solidarity.\n283.\tAcceptance by every Member State of the principles set forth in the Charter and consequently of the obligations arising there from constitute the fundamental basis for con-temporary international relations. The use of force as a means of repression and domination of peoples is contrary to recognized standards of international law. The Charter states that all men are equal and proclaims the right of every people, large and small, to live freely and to decide its own fate.\n284.\tThe Maubere people of East Timor, after several centuries of suffering under a colonial regime, has acquired that inalienable right which was recognized 20 years ago by the community of nations. A people does not fight against foreign domination to accept freely the confiscation of its dearly won freedom. This explains the extent of the resistance of the FRETILIN fighters to the Indonesian forces of aggression and their determination in an unequal and difficult struggle.\n285.\tThe attitude of the Government of Indonesia is all the more unacceptable since the Government of Portugal, the administering Power, in a communiqu\u00e9 issued on 12 September 1980' has again reaffirmed its responsibility in the matter of the complete decolonization of East Timor. The United Nations, in condemning the Indonesian invasion in its relevant resolutions, should not confine itself to a mere verbal rejection of the policy of fait accompli. The international community must not lose sight of the fact that this is a flagrant violation of human rights and that the indescribable sufferings imposed on the population of a small country by a neighbouring State, powerfully armed and motivated by an expansionist policy, is contrary to the law of nations. The international community must demand the withdrawal of all the Indonesian forces from East Timor, and the United Nations and its specialized agencies, and particularly the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, should continue to intervene so as to help the Maubere people to recover the right to independence. The Government of Guinea-Bissau encourages the Portuguese authorities to pursue their efforts and thus honourably discharge their debt to history,\n286.\tOne of the cardinal principles of the Organization is the settlement of disputes by peaceful means. The negotiations begun between the Government of the Comoros and the Government of France on the question of the Comorian island of Mayotte lead us to believe that a just solution, taking into account the territorial integrity of the entire Comoros and the unity of its people, will be found. We also hope that the same spirit of accommodation will lead the Government of France to establish with the Government of the Democratic Republic of Madagascar a fruitful dialogue concerning the problem of the return of the Malagasy islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova and Bassas da India.\n287.\tThe armed conflict that for some days has been going on between Iran and Iraq is grave and concerns us particularly because these are two fraternal countries and, above all, members of the non-aligned movement and of the Islamic Conference, to which my country, Guinea-Bissau, belongs. We sincerely hope that wisdom and a spirit of conciliation will prevail in the relations between these two friendly countries and that, with the sincere and constructive contribution of all, an atmosphere of harmony and friendship will be restored.\n288.\tIn a world in constant change because of the political upheavals which are sometimes beyond control, dialogue among peoples remains a sine qua non for the maintenance of peace. The efforts of the Secretary-General to promote direct intercommunal talks in Cyprus are in accordance with this objective which, in our opinion, is essential. My Government believes in fact that only negotiation among the parties concerned can lead to a just and lasting solution. Such a solution should take into account the national independence and territorial integrity of Cyprus and its character as a non-aligned country. I would avail myself of this opportunity to pay a tribute to the United Nations Forces stationed on Cyprus and to congratulate the Governments which have made them available on their valuable contribution to the establishment of an atmosphere of peace in that region.\n289.\tThe peaceful reunification of the two parts of Korea had already reached an encouraging stage but now it is encountering inadmissible obstacles because of foreign interference. The Korean people must be able, in accordance with its legitimate aspirations, to achieve its unity freely, an essential prerequisite for which must, be the withdrawal of all foreign troops stationed in Korea.\n290.\tCambodia, which was once the model of a 'positive neutralism', is today undergoing a prolonged tragedy. The humanism that some countries vaunt to justify their excessive zeal in regard to this dramatic question seems to us to be doubtful. It is difficult to solve the problem of the Cambodian refugees without a realistic approach to the situation, and the international community is too mature to deceive itself. In this matter the United Nations should observe the rules and international practices and admit to its deliberations representatives of the Government that effectively exercises power.\n291.\tThe World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, held at Copenhagen last July, provided an opportunity for the women of the world to remind the international community of the many forms of inequality from which they are suffering and their firm determination to place the state of their creative abilities on all important decisions bearing on the peace and well-being of mankind. Guinea-Bissau, a country in which women are from every standpoint equal to men, actively participated in that Conference because it wished to emphasize the preponderant role of women in the liberation and development of African societies and their responsibilities in the building of our young nations. My Government welcomes the adoption by the Conference of the Programme of Action for the Second Half of the Decade and will participate with conviction and interest in achieving its aims.\n292.\tAt a time when mankind is uncertain as to its destiny which, under the pressure of economic crises, seems to be heading towards an uncertain future, military expenditures are approaching the astronomical figure of $500 billion. This is both revolting and scandalous when one considers the poverty from which most of the countries of the world suffer. A measure of relief came about in May 1978, after the adoption of a disarmament strategy, the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, but, unfortunately, this was not followed by any other measures, except an irresponsible escalation of the arms race.\n293.\tThe pressing development needs of the third world, which the members of OAU have described with conviction in the Lagos Plan, are thus relegated to the background because the organic link between security and development has been ignored for the sake of a peace which, since it is not based on an equitable redistribution of the wealth of the world, must be precarious if not unattainable. The security needs of our respective peoples, although legitimate, cannot justify the fact that almost 6 per cent of the world's product is spent on armaments, to the detriment of the balance of human society. Thus the international community, particularly the nuclear countries, must again read the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session, the better to give practical effect to the solemn commitment they have entered into and to renew, in these early days of the Second Disarmament Decade, their commitment to work for total disarmament, an essential condition for the security of our peoples, if not for the very survival of mankind.\n294.\tThe eleventh special session of the General Assembly, which dealt with development, led to a realization of the true scope of the problems regarding the establishment of a new international economic order. The hope of the developing countries to find among the industrialized countries a new concept of interdependence of peoples and of their solidarity was bitterly disappointed. No doubt the impatience of some, together with the stubborn attitude of others, limited the possibilities for success of that session, which concluded, nevertheless, with the preparation of an International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade. Although meagre, this result should encourage us to pursue global negotiations in such important fields as raw materials, energy, development, monetary and financial questions and trade. In this specific case, my country welcomes the important measures taken recently by UNCTAD leading to the establishment of a Common Fund and the adoption of a series of rules and principles regarding restrictive trade practices.\n295.\tThe ninth session of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea ended, as is well known, on a note of optimism. The importance of these negotiations for the strengthening of international relations confers on the results already achieved colossal dimensions, and my country attaches particular attention to this, the imminent adoption of a convention will certainly fill a gap and at the same time sweep away with many disagreements among States. In the meantime, Member States should refrain from taking any unilateral legislative measure which might undermine the chances for success of that convention.\n296.\tMy country, Guinea-Bissau, is a non-aligned State deeply devoted to the ideals of peace and social justice. The actions of our Government since the accession of Guinea-Bissau to national sovereignty have always tended to promote sincere and friendly co-operation among peoples and an atmosphere of confidence and mutual respect. My country is determined to pursue this conception of international relations, because it is in accord with the principles of our party, the PAIGC [Partido Africano da Independencia da Guini e Cabo Verde], and it is in conformity with the aims and objectives enunciated in the Charter of the United Nations. Guinea-Bissau is a peace-loving nation. Our people, who during its struggle for national liberation enjoyed the support of international solidarity, will continue to back all just causes throughout the world. It will spare no effort to consolidate the historical and fraternal links which unite it with the other peoples of the world and intends to leave its own imprint as an African people on mankind's march towards progress.\n","label":1}

She realized that happiness doesn't come from chasing after superficial desires, but from living a life true to oneself. And she lived happily ever after, knowing that she had learned the most valuable lesson of all - to be careful what you wish for.\n\nThe End.\n\n","label":0}
{"text":"Speaker 3: Q Mr. Clarke, we're going to go to the regular agenda and we're going to do item 24, just so the next two items are 24 and 25. So we'll start with 24.\nSpeaker 0: Communication from Councilwoman Zendejas, Councilmember Pierce, Councilwoman Mongo, Vice Mayor Andrews. Recommendation to request City Manager to take advantage of upcoming available external funding with the goal of creating an emergency housing incentive program.\nSpeaker 3: Okay. This comes from us, and they have to destroy your item.\nSpeaker 1: Yes, Mayor, thank you. First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues for joining me in and helping put this item forward. I'd also like to thank a city staff, especially Theresa Chandler, for all her outstanding work that she's been putting into this day in and day out. As you know, based on the results of our homeless count that we that were released this month, Long Beach saw a 7% increase in our numbers of unsheltered people from 2019 to 2020. We should also be clear that this does not reflect the thousands of people who have likely become house homeless during this time of COVID 19 . Even after an outbreak of COVID 19. I was hearing from my residents every day that they're looking for solutions to help address homelessness. And each day, my colleagues and I would say the same thing. This means that. As a community. We all know that homeless is is a huge problem and it needs to be addressed. This said, our current circumstances have left us with opportunities to rethink what emergency housing looks like. In California, Project Roomkey has helped draw a line between the needs of our unsheltered neighbors and our historical low motel occupancy rate during COVID 19. Whether someone wishes to stay with with a partner, a family or animal companions, or if the fear of violence and health issues is in a shelter project room key and the ability to use the motels as emergency shelters has really helped during this time. Unlike emergency shelters which have low occupancy rate, our project ROOMKEY units are at 97% occupied. So which which also indicates that there's a big need for them and that folks are actually being. I mean, folks are actually taking advantage of having this opportunity. Our city staff. I mean, our city has around 5000 hotels and motel rooms right now, the majority of which are being kept empty right now due to the crisis that we're in. The goal here is to create incentives for additional motels in Long Beach to participate in a program that continues expanding access to room for everyone in our city in need. It is of utmost importance to note that we would benefit from the the motel owners and operators by compensating them for rooms and that otherwise would actually just be sitting there without occupancy. So we're healthy. Not only are we helping are those experiencing homelessness, but we're also helping those businesses who are in dire need of business. We also have the opportunity to offset some of these some of these costs. With efforts and working together with the state and federal funding that is that is going to be available and is available at this time. In terms of funding, I think it's important to note that while items request. Staff to to come back in 30 days. Many opportunities are are very short time. So we must act quickly on this. This month alone, $5,500 million became available from the state of coronavirus relief funds for motel acquisitions and non congregational bridging housing. The funding begins to be has begun to be distributed and it is a first come, first served basis. So this is why it's also very important to act now. There's also additional 450 million of the state coronavirus relief fund that will be available for cities who have not previously received their own unique allocation of CRF dollars. Long Beach included. The city is also set to receive 13.8 million in phase two emergency solution grants from the Federal Government of Housing and Urban Development. These funds can be put towards non congregational shelters as well. And finally, it is the. The case of the state's coronavirus relief fund. In that case, if it cannot help for the long term ongoing expenses of such a program, 350 million of these, say General Fund, is is most likely to become available to cities and could be used for this. And important means. There are several avenues for federal and state resources available. But again, we must act quickly to make sure that we that we get what we deserve and what is needed to help our. Neighbors experiencing homelessness. Again, with that said, I really, really appreciate my colleagues for joining in on this item with me. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Councilwoman. I have a box cued up, so we'll just go Vice Mayor Andrews and then right into Councilmember Pearce.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you very much, Mia. I first of all, I think council and data will engage me on this item. You know, in my opinion, this woman in District six has been the most proactive in building and accepting affordable housing in the district. You go down Long Beach Boulevard, you'll see it. We're still building. Revamping current motels into supportive housing is a very creative way to approach blight and illegal activities already occurred. And these sites. With the proper safety protocol and community engagement and this idea, I think we can approach two problems with one solution. But my hope and request is that we look and expand opportunities. We do so equally and across all nine districts so we can all truly be a part of the solution to end homelessness. And thank you very much for this item.\nSpeaker 1: I'll go ahead and start, since it sounds like the mayor already called on me. As Councilwoman Pierce, I want to thank Councilmembers and de Health for bringing this item forward. And, you know, one thing that some of us keep saying about this moment in history is that it's an opportunity for us to lift up some of the work that we've been trying to tackle for a long time. And this is also the case with housing, transitional housing and trying to make sure that we provide services for those that are experiencing homelessness. I know that this council has long reviewed opportunities to be able to add additional transitional housing, as was noted with the hearing item that we had today. And so I love this item. I would like to ask staff on the what are we currently doing? And the funding sources that councilmembers and DE have mentioned are those opportunities that we think we can make a big impact. And is that impact only in being able to provide additional vouchers and incentives? Or where are we with the bigger conversation that we've had about being able to purchase some of these motels that have been problem areas in transit, turn them over to transitional housing?\nSpeaker 5: This time. So I will turn that over to Theresa Chandler. I do want to say that this is an area that we're excited about. This is the very first time we've had these types of resources and be able to stand up a program such as taking over a hotel and making that our area that we accommodate some of our homeless clients. And it's been successful. We've learned a lot, and we're interested in doing a lot more. And there is now federal and state money that can help but do do both of the things that you talked about. So I will turn that to Theresa.\nSpeaker 1: So exciting. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Thank you, council members, for bringing this item to the forefront. As Tom said, it is a very important issue for us. And as we've had the opportunity to work with Project ROOMKEY and have it have participants in Project ROOMKEY, we certainly don't want every turn those folks into homelessness. And so we're excited at the opportunities that are coming to us through the State Project Homekey program. And so the application guidelines have not quite been released, but we will be applying for those funds. And so we do have an affordable housing workgroup within our city teams where we are putting together lists of potential sites for acquisition . And of course, you know, we can look at the sites, hotels, motels, different things across the city available for acquisition. The issue has always been how to fund the programs ongoing. So with the current funding coming in through the Emergency Solutions Grant and also the second round of HAP funding, the expectation of about $3 million to come to Long Beach. There are some opportunities where we can actually move forward with project based vouchers and other types of programing set forth and then also with future HUD funding potentially for permanent supportive housing. So this is a really exciting opportunity for us to move forward and to keep our neighbors experiencing homelessness in housing as they've been sheltered. And also just just as a city to collectively wrap our arms around folks who have previously been on the streets. Wonderful. Thank you. And, you know, we've got, I think, four motels off the top of my head that would make great locations in the second District. So I fully support that. I also just before passing it on, I want to say, you know, there's been a lot of work that led up to this moment, not only with the current COVID, but with Measure H in the county and Andy Kerr and the housing groups that have done work to get us to this point . So there's a couple of exciting moments tonight that I just want to make sure we recognize that this is what happens when you never let your foot off the gas and you just continue to try and try and eventually some things will fall into place. So thank you guys for this. Appreciate it.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you, Councilwoman. Next up, we have Councilwoman Mango and then Councilmember Richardson. Councilwoman Mongo. That's when Mongo. Okay. Let me move on and come back. Councilman Richardson.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. A couple of things. First of all, thanks for bringing this item forward. Councilmember and House is certainly on time given given all the efforts the city and the region has done to ensure that we don't lose focus on the homelessness issue while we face a crisis on multiple fronts. Two things I want to highlight, though. Look, I understand that the goal is to incentivize folks to participate and project homekey. And and so Homekey is what you know, a lot of the funding that's coming out is Project HOMEKEY separately from Roomkey. And I understand that there's a deadline of July 15 or the process opens July 15th, rather, for hotels and organizations to apply to participate. I know that some of this research may not come back until well after that, but I think that we should do and I hear from staff what I think we should do is use our communication channels to make sure that we promote this window that's opening, because I know that other cities are beginning to do that. Let's make sure that we promote that this grant, this opportunity is opening. And then secondly, whatever incentives that we put forward for people to participate, we can maybe talk about those now before they're even in place to demonstrate that whoever has participated will receive whatever incentives we're able to put together so that they understand that although the incentive may not be in place today, then it may take, you know, a number of weeks to pull it together. Go ahead and apply now for the program. And I think it's important that we we nuance that. Tom, Tom, do you understand what I'm what what I'm trying to articulate here?\nSpeaker 5: Yeah, I think we do. So we are going to apply for those dollars. And as I understand it, if we get good actors who are working with us and want to be able to do this work and they're really doing a good job, that if we come up with some kind of program in the future on this , that they would certainly benefit and be a part of that to the extent we can legally do that.\nSpeaker 2: Right. And and my understanding is when the application opens up, it's not necessarily cities who apply. It would be motel owners and affordable housing developers. And those are the types who would apply for funding. In addition, it may be in addition to cities, but but that's that's the challenge. We don't have our folks ready and I get a number of motel owners may say, hey, this isn't for me. But they need to understand that, number one, they can make money from this and it helps the city and we will support this this process. So so I think the communication to them and making sure that that gets our message gets out is important. Thanks a lot. I'm satisfied there. The second thing that I would say, just, you know, I want to make sure that we are and I've talked with Tracy Longo, who led our motel strategy. I want to make sure that we connect the dots between our nuisance motel strategy in the city and this project. Homekey, because there may be opportunities for some of these motels that are nuisances. There's already strategies to acquire them that we can leverage some of these resources to make sure that we are we are engaging some of these motels so that ultimately we can convert them into a much better use that has less crime, less human trafficking, less violence, and something more stable like affordable housing. I just want to make sure that we lift that a lift up that point that.\nSpeaker 3: And next week Councilman Mongo on the line yet her councilman Mongo. Okay. Let me go to Councilwoman Pryce and then, Councilman, your anger.\nSpeaker 1: Q Mr. Mayor, so I want to thank Council members and the House for bringing this item and for her colleagues that are colleagues that signed onto the item. I think it's a fantastic opportunity. I think Councilmember Pearce is correct that as unfortunate as the situations around us have been since the middle of March, they have provided some opportunities, especially in terms of grants and opportunities for us to get resources from the state and federal government and the county to try to address some of these issues that we've been talking about for years. So I think this is a great opportunity. I also want to acknowledge the great work of the United Way team who I know several of my colleagues had an opportunity to talk with in advance of tonight's meeting, and they just did a fantastic briefing for for those who are like me, who enjoy reading things. I thought that their briefing sheets were really, really well prepared and very objective. And I just want to acknowledge that we get briefed by a lot of entities and weigh in from a lot of different entities. And I found that the presentation tonight and the efforts by those who care about this topic to educate council members before the vote was really fantastic. So I just wanted to acknowledge that and thank you council members and our house for bringing them forward.\nSpeaker 3: Jan Ringa.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. And I want to agree with the council, my colleagues, in terms of our customers and neighbors bringing this forward. It's a great idea at the time that I've gone beyond our need. We really need to have this. It's been long overdue, and I'm glad that it's here and that we're discussing this. But as we know, when we're dealing with homeless individuals, we have the additional challenge of the services on there, and they're wanting to take advantage of some of the services that are being offered to them. So with that, I'm asking the question as to are there moneys being set aside for additional services to individuals who are experiencing homelessness and who would be able to take advantage of these programs? Because as it's been said before and other previous comments and by researches and papers that we've had, we've seen it takes 14, 15, sometimes 20 contacts with a homeless person before they accept any kind of assistance. So with that, is there any. Plan or any resource is going to be going into helping them personally as well with behavioral services and other types of needs that they may have before you take advantage of these programs.\nSpeaker 1: Sorry for the delay. Yes, that is always something that we're looking at on how to engage folks. There's more funding through the ESG dollars as well for that that those outreach efforts and which leads into case management. And that really is what helps wraparound folks to get them connected to services. So there's always that's the first thing we look at when funding opportunities come in that have more flexibility is how we can truly connect with people. Because, as you said, it's about 17 contacts to get people to just say yes. But then the real work happens when you want it, when people are then ready to come in and then getting them to stay inside. So that's always a priority for us.\nSpeaker 2: Well, again, thank the council members in their house for bringing this forward to full support. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Councilmember councilman, among other. Councilman Mongo. I know you said that you're.\nSpeaker 1: Can you hear me? Yes, Mayor. Hi. Thank you. And the mayor? Was I the second year of the motion? Before I got disconnected.\nSpeaker 3: Before you got disconnected, you know, you queued up against a lawsuit in the queue because you didn't know you were not.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Thank you for this opportunity. I really appreciate the work that Councilwoman Sun has said and her team also along with the work the city staff did. This is important stuff. I think that fining people homes is the first step. We also need to have the plans that go with the the motel room opportunities. So I like that this is a comprehensive approach. I like that the city is looking at this along with many other things, including rent abatement and other things for that fund. I think it's important to outline and oversee all the funds in their entirety. And while I appreciate the item and signed on to it, because it's important, it's also important for us to take each of those funds as they come in and evaluate all the different opportunities for working and healing and supporting the residents of our city . So I just want to keep that in perspective as we go forward. There are a lot of funds. I know the city staff put together quite a comprehensive list of of opportunities that we can use these funds. And so I want to make sure that we look at the best return on investment. I think this is a very good return. When we do house people. We also need to make sure that those individuals then move into more permanent housing to reopen those beds up for other individuals who need the transitional housing. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Great. I got it. Before I turn this back over to councilman and he has to close. Want to just add so I know there's been a lot of work in this area happening. I think this is a great piece of legislation to kind of put all that together and and move the city forward. I wanted to just maybe ask Mr. Kerley, who's probably, I'm guessing, is on the line as well. So there have been a lot of efforts this year, I know through the through the mayor's group and just through our legislative or legislative calendar, an agenda on obviously getting more funding directly for homelessness. Obviously, Project ROOMKEY has been a big part of the governor's initiative around COVID. Do you do you Mr.. Mr. Kerley, how much did we get from a funding perspective? I don't I couldn't remember the number of stuff in my head. I know we made a last minute push to get additional funding for homelessness separate of the COVID recovery money. You have that number for Long Beach by any chance for this year.\nSpeaker 4: Yes. Separate from the hotel motel acquisition program, they set aside 300 million total for homeless services. And we're estimating based on last year's allocation methodology, that we would receive around 3 million this year for homeless services. And those are separate from the CARES Act dollars. So they're tied to the general fund and are not tied to the December deadline for using those dollars.\nSpeaker 3: Those are programmatic dollars. And then how much money is in the kind of hotel motel acquisition bucket that the governor put in place?\nSpeaker 4: So the state fund for hotel no topic acquisition is $550 million.\nSpeaker 3: Okay, great. That's great. And then let me also just add and again, I want to thank our our government affairs team is. Last year, actually, the city of Long Beach sponsored legislation through Senator Amberg and Senator Embry actually introduced legislation for us to kind of fast track through the secret process, motel conversion for this kind of very reason. And so I think that that really sets us up to be ready for this infusion of resources that's coming down from the state and and other places, obviously. And so that's another great piece of all of this as well. And so I just want to want to also just throw out some thank you to obviously the governor for supporting this work. Senator Amberg for the support of his bill last year. And certainly to our own team, to you, Mr. Curley, and our our local government affairs team for just the work and to making sure that we get these resources as well. So thank you to everyone. And let me turn this over to Councilman and Dallas.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you, Mayor. And yes, thank you again, city staff for all your hard work. I also wanted to share some incentives with you of this program. So one of the things that we are hoping to do is that the city would cover costs for maintenance and upkeep, as well as reimbursement for damages, a wear and tear and some ongoing cause. We would also have dedicated support and case managers from from our Health Department and human services and and also services from our homeless services team. And so that would be really helpful to to help those hotels and motels more more likely that, you know, to actually have an incentive to actually participate, especially like what Councilmember Gordon said may be, you know, really focusing on those motels that are not doing so good. And and maybe this is a way of uplifting those motels is good. It's very important that we take these steps not only right now because it's just needed, but it's really, really needed because of COVID. Just the other day, we had a horrendous event where one of our neighbors that's experiencing the homeless, Kenny, was brutally stabbed. And, you know, we cannot have our homeless neighbors living in those situations and putting themselves at risk, not ever, but especially not right now during COVID. So, again, I appreciate everybody who's supporting this this item, and I look forward to working really hard to make this a very successful pilot program. Thank you.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. Before I go to the public, he's he's going to hate that I do this, but I got to correct myself. It's not Mr. Curley, it's Dr. Curley. So sorry about that. He had Dr. Curly and with that good public comment.\nSpeaker 4: Our first speaker is Mark Cavaney.\nSpeaker 2: Your time starts now. Thank you. My name is Mark Shinobi. I'd like to thank Councilwoman Zen de Haas and the other council members who cosigned us for bringing it forward. I've been a resident of District two and Long Beach for 12 years and I am in strong support of the emergency housing incentives program. I see vulnerable, unhoused residents in my neighborhood every day, and this program has the potential to immediately provide them with the safe housing they need to protect them from the COVID 19 pandemic, and also provide them with the necessary services and care to put them on a path to long term recovery. It's no secret that the COVID 19 pandemic is getting worse, not better. And as Councilman Richardson and others have pointed out, the RFP for motel acquisition funding opens in less than ten days. So this item is extremely urgent and needs to be acted upon quickly. The report back on available resources should bring back an ordinance as soon as possible that outlines a plan for the funding to be used to create permanent non congregate housing for our most vulnerable unhoused. 78% of all people experiencing homelessness in Long Beach are unsheltered, which is an 11% increase from last year. 23% of people experiencing homelessness in L.A. County are elderly, which puts them at increased risk regarding coronavirus. And let us also not forget that homelessness and the coronavirus disproportionately affects the black community in Long Beach. 13% of the population of Long Beach is black, but they make up 38% of Long Beach unhoused population. The Emergency Housing Incentives Program will have a direct, immediate and lasting impact on these populations. I urge all council members to please pass this item tonight and bring a plan back for approval as soon as possible. Please take advantage of this opportunity to help our most vulnerable unhoused neighbors. Thank you. Thank you. Next year, Seagrams, your time starts now.\nSpeaker 1: Hello. District three. I am in full support, Stacy or Susie of this item and I hope all of you vote to pass it. Just as the person who so eloquently spoke before me stated This needs to be passed and needs to be acted on immediately. We have a lot of our community members are living, unhoused and need support. Period point blank. They need support. They need our support. This gives the emergency housing incentive program gives. And so I understand 500 units of single occupancy shelter. We need more than that. I mean, this is. Yes. 500 beds. Yes. But we need more. We need probably, like way more than double, if not triple that, to meet the needs of our community. We have the money, as we know, that ties back to the issue of police funding. We have the money if we take away the funds from the police. I know this might sound simplistic, but there is a process for this to happen. If there isn't a process created, we're acting. We're asking. You were demanding that you be creative in this moment. This is what this is what this moment is asking of us to be creative, to be adaptive, and to think outside the box. Do not continue on the road that we are on. We need new options. In order to meet the needs of our community. I yield my time.\nSpeaker 2: Thank you. Next year, Jordan, when your time starts now. Hi there. This is Jordan Win District two and field director for the Everyone in Lomita program. I really want to thank Council member Marion DAVIES for her hard work on the site and we worked pretty closely to help put this together and I'm really grateful for council members Mungo Pearce and Andrews who signed on to this item as well. I'm glad that the city is taking a very proactive first step at helping really build out and amplify our infrastructure for caring for people experiencing homelessness, both in the short and long term. I love the fact that the city is also looking proactively at the fact that this is going to help create immediate units while also looking at the long term implications and building out permanent fixtures to help aid in caring for those who are on the streets right now and most vulnerable. We need 500 emergency housing units as quickly as we can get them on the ground to help aid our most vulnerable populations of people experiencing homelessness, including seniors and those with medical disabilities. As was stated earlier, 78% of all people experiencing homelessness were counted as unsheltered this year, which is 1578 people. And this opportunity here to acquire motels and create these sites gives us a rare opportunity, as was noted by Theresa Chandler, to substantially reduce the number of people who are unsheltered on our streets. I do want to bring up a point of clarification on Project HOMEKEY, which is the $550 million that is set aside for motel acquisition by the state. I believe it was mentioned by Councilmember Richardson about, you know, developers applying or operators applying. I want to clarify that. It's it's the government plus the developers. So the municipality plus the operator that would need to apply or it could also just be the municipality, and then they can grant out the money given from its acquisition to developers or operators, depending on what the city so chooses. Just wanted to put that clarifying point out because the RFP will be opening up on July 15th. But keeping that deadline in mind, I do think that it is important for the city to get this item back to council as quickly as it can because that is kind of the linchpin of this program, is that $550 million in order to get those on the ground. I love the fact that councilmembers are bringing up adaptive ways to utilize these dollars. Councilmember Mongeau is completely correct in that it is important not just to have the housing but to also have the wraparound services there . It's something that has definitely been seen and learned from the Project Roomkey site that we're currently operating in Long Beach, and I definitely want to see that continuing here in the city. So once again, thank you to all the council members. Let's make sure that we get everyone in as quickly as we can. Thanks so much. Thank you. That concludes public comment for this item.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. It's going to a roll call vote.\nSpeaker 0: District one.\nSpeaker 1: Upheld by.\nSpeaker 0: District two. I'm District three. I district for.\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 0: District five. District five. District six.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: All right.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, I.\nSpeaker 0: District seven.\nSpeaker 2: I.\nSpeaker 0: District eight.\nSpeaker 2: II.\nSpeaker 0: District nine. Motion carries.\nSpeaker 3: Thank you. We're going to go ahead and move on to item 25, please.","label":1}
