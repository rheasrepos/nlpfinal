{"prompt":"\ufeffMr. President, the Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulate you on your election as President of the thirty-fourth session of the General Assembly and to wish you well in your new office. That you were elected to that office by this body is ample evidence of the Assembly's faith in your capacity to live up to the high expectation of that responsibility. The commonwealth of Dominica also salutes the United Republic of Tanzania for producing so able a diplomat.\n3.\tThe Commonwealth of Dominica also congratulates the Secretary-General for a comprehensive and instructive report on the work of the United Nations over the past year. The report gives us confidence that there is some hope for the continuation of the fine work that the United Nations has been undertaking and for the continued projection of the spirit of peace and security and brotherhood that inspired its foundation. We note that the report also very realistically lets it be known that all is not so well in many areas of the Organization's endeavours, one of those being the area of peace-keeping. It is to be hoped that each of us will examine his conscience in respect of the principles of the Charter and by so doing reaffirm our commitment and allegiance to those principles.\n4.\tThe Commonwealth of Dominica wishes to congratulate our sister State, Saint Lucia, which became the one hundred fifty-second Member of the Organization during this current session of the General Assembly, and we look forward to welcoming the State of Saint Vincent in the not-too-distant future. We are confident that we shall find it easy to work with every Member of the Organization. We wish also to thank all those Members which have promoted and greeted our admission to the United Nations and which have promoted and defended our interests in that forum.\n5.\tIt is said that what is obvious and well-known bears purposeful repeating at certain times and in certain places. Hence, permit me to observe with emphasis that the Commonwealth of Dominica is a small country. I am pleased to be reminded of the saying, too, that good things come in small packages. We trust that the representation here of our country will be a shining example of the tradition of this Organization and of the international community as a whole, and that, further, this bears testimony to the fundamental rights of all free and independent nations, irrespective of size, to participate and contribute in the deliberations of this Assembly.\n6.\tThe emergence on the world scene of a large number of small States or mini-States, particularly in the Caribbean, is one of the phenomena of the second half of the twentieth century. But while the world community has recognized this phenomenon, yet very little has been done in concrete terms to come to grips with the very real problems\u2014such as a lack of economic viability and an undue dependence on metropolitan Powers\u2014confronting these States. Note is taken with much concern of the threatened confrontation of two of the world's super-Powers on the very doorsteps of the Caribbean archipelago. The implications of this can be very far-reaching, especially in terms of the future development of our countries and the stability of this region as a whole, and therefore we hope for an early resolution of this situation in the best interest of the Caribbean basin.\n7.\tIt is well known that the Commonwealth of Dominica became a legally, politically independent and sovereign State on 3 November 1978, which is less than a year ago. The chequered constitutional, social and political history of our State up to that date makes for some interesting reading. However, we are aware that many other States Members of the United Nations are not familiar with that history in its intimate details. Our country is a Caribbean State, situated at longitude 61 degrees west and latitude 15 degrees north. It is only 289.5 square miles in area and has a population of approximately 80,000. It lies between the two departments of the Republic of France\u2014Guadeloupe, which is some 30 miles to the north, and Martinique, which is some 30 miles to the south. This geographical proximity has resulted in an ongoing and dynamic cultural closeness which is reflected in the fact that a large number of Dominicans still speak a French patois.\n8.\tThe basically export-oriented agricultural economy of our country has rested mainly on bananas, which constitute about 60 per cent of our exports and 80 per cent of foreign-exchange earnings, and a small quantity of citrus and coconuts. Our tourist industry has been slowly getting off the ground, but this trend has now been tragically reversed, as has so much else in Dominica, since the onslaught of Hurricane David on 29 August 1979.\n9.\tThe story of third-world countries can be a fascinating and painful drama, but ours would certainly be in the running for first place if there were prizes to be awarded. Towards the latter part of 1978 and during the early part of 1979, the dreadful leaf-spot disease wreaked havoc with the banana industry of the Commonwealth of Dominica. The self-evident story of the implications of such an occurrence for an economy whose efforts are based mainly on the tourist industry and, of course, on agriculture is, in fact, too difficult to go into in detail. The impact may be grasped, however, if we say simply that the banana industry, which is largely labour-intensive in the Commonwealth of Dominica and which employed several thousands of persons, was responsible for the bulk of our exports and foreign-exchange earnings, as has already been noted. This has linkages and interfacings that permeate the economy as a whole and, consequently, the life and livelihood of the entire population. The leaf-spot disease and the disaster were hardly over when the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica embarked upon a 24-day constitutional and democratic struggle to replace without violence and within the framework of their independence Constitution, a Government that they considered high-handed and dictatorial. There was a high economic price to pay for the 24 days during which the popular struggle lasted; but the unprecedented constitutional end to the struggle, which resulted in victory for the people and the preservation of democracy, the integrity of the Constitution and respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, have lessons for States Members of the United Nations and, indeed, for all who are genuinely interested in the preservation of democratic constitutions and in the universal struggle for the preservation of the fundamental rights and freedoms and the downtrodden at home and abroad.\n10.\tThe Commonwealth of Dominica had not recovered from the shock and rigours of that struggle when a completely unexpected and deadly stroke by the forces of nature wreaked havoc with the economy, infrastructure and other aspects of life in my country.\n11.\tThe report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Organization makes interesting, but not really surprising, reading in most respects. The remarks contained therein with respect to the political and economic state of the international community, though largely dismal from the immediate point of view of the less developed countries of the world, is a good barometer of the state of the human spirit in an age when there is so much talk, so much discussion and so much journalistic fulmination about human rights and a corollary, the New International Economic Order\u2014a good indicator, indeed, of the sincerity of an unproductive North-South dialogue.\n12.\tDominica, along with other Caribbean States, continues to deplore the apartheid policy of South Africa. That foolhardy policy must fail in time. The dynamics of international exchange and intercourse dictate this. Our own experience has taught us, quite recently, that a suffering and deprived people will always revolt against their oppressors. What is to be hoped is that it will not be too long before the abomination called apartheid is ended and that the price for ending it will not be too costly in terms of human life. In the meantime, those countries which continue to bolster, directly or indirectly, the racist, inhuman system for economic and other reasons, in violation of United Nations sanctions and of conscience, good faith and human decency, must be severely condemned. It is only by the imposition and meticulous observation of the severest sanctions against the evil system of human degradation and exploitation\u2014be such sanctions imposed by individual nations or by the international community\u2014that the system will be brought to heel. All countries whose disposition and persuasion in this matter are similar to ours come in for the highest commendation from the Government and entire people of the Commonwealth of Dominica.\n13.\tWe think, perhaps from the point of view of a country not long since cast into the arena of international politics, that the answer to the underlying theme of continuing disturbances in the Middle East lies in the recognition and implementation of the rights of all peoples of the area to a secure homeland which can be enjoyed with dignity. Unless this basic principle is observed and pursued with vigour, with a view to genuine realization, the situation in the Middle East will continue to deteriorate, with increased adverse consequences for the international community.\n14.\tWe in the Caribbean do not wish to see the region become a pawn in the international power play. The Commonwealth of Dominica believes in the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of independent, sovereign States. We also believe in the concomitant sovereign right of independent States to choose their allies. It is for this reason that we express reservation about uninvited interference in any form in the internal affairs of other independent States.\n15.\tMr. President, my Government is fully aware of your record as Chairman of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and being fully cognizant of the imperative nature of General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV) of 1960, we wish to recommend that member States, and the Special Committee on decolonization, should keep a keen eye on the Powers which, by subtle means and by use of euphemistic terminology, perpetuate the process and system of colonization in its old form and in new forms either by economic or ideological means. The Commonwealth of Dominica is further aware that there are many territories and peoples which are still labouring under the yoke of colonialism, which want political independence and an opportunity for self-determination, and whose wishes are being balked in one way or another. To resist submission to the wishes, the will and the determination of such peoples is to court disaster. By the same token it ought to be a moral and human obligation, spelled out in international law, that a colonizing, metropolitan Power, should adequately prepare those colonized to face independence, and that such preparation should not be an excuse for the perpetuation and prolongation of colonial status. Such preparation should also include at least the provision of a sufficiently basic and sound infrastructure. A colonized, enslaved people can never be compensated for the material, physical, social, \ncultural and resource exploitation which colonization represents, but at least this would enable them to 'take off over a reasonable period. In that regard, the Commonwealth of Dominica certainly would be hypocritical if it claimed to be a blessed, uncomplaining beneficiary of any largesse on the part of the United Kingdom. Indeed, even to this day, we cannot claim to have had great, if indeed any, success in gaining access to a token independence gift offered by that country. If the reason for such failure is attributable to the Commonwealth of Dominica, as some would suggest, that is, nevertheless, a strident indictment of colonialism.\n16.\tThe literature on international economic issues is of old and also of current vintage, voluminous and increasing, and the verbal debate and recrimination continues almost ad infinitum. As we all know, the stark fact is that the rich and advantaged, generally, are getting better off, while the poor and disadvantaged, at east in numerical terms, are getting worse off. Now, to the delight of some, we have coined a new escapist phrase: 'New International Economic Order'. That there is need now, and that there was need before, of such an order is beyond question. What appear to have always been at issue and in question is the will and the determination to institute that Order.\n17.\tThe Commonwealth of Dominica is mindful of the whole range of important domestic and international factors that can militate against the speedy realization of the much-needed tilting of the inequitable international economic balance. We find it difficult to accept the short-sighted psychology that perpetuates the use of those plausible factors as a means of continuing and reinforcing an economic system that is unquestionably both unjust and exploitative, explosive and ultimately self-destructive.\n18.\tTo complicate matters, the world is faced with an energy crisis which we seem unable to solve. Again, I must emphasize the Commonwealth of Dominica's understanding of the domestic and international imperatives and 4'polities'* that complicate the problem of oil. For example, we understand the need in some quarters to make good the losses suffered as a result of exploitation, and we also understand the counter reaction not to allow former colonies to use oil as a weapon or for blackmail. What we, like the Secretary-General, find difficult to accept is the forced and artificial divorce of the energy issue from the rest of the international economic issues. We are not impressed because we are sceptical about the ultimate consequences of that divorce on the economies of 'innocent' countries and the lives of millions of ordinary citizens of the world. That is why we think that the advice of the Secretary- General in his report on the Organization bears repeating:\n'We need to organize our efforts to bring the negotiations on the implementation of the new international economic order out of their present state of stalemate;\nWe need to deal vigorously with the area of energy, which is a major challenge, and to launch a co-ordinated and imaginative effort by the world community in this field;\n'We need to address the urgent problems of the oil-importing developing countries in a concerted and effective way.' \n19.  From the foregoing views on international politics and the economic scene, I wish to revert to the situation at home.\n20.\tI should like to present in some detail the devastation which was wreaked by Hurricane David. If there is one disaster that appears to have brought international attention to the Commonwealth of Dominica, it is this catastrophe. That is not surprising. The hurricane was the worst in 100 years, bringing winds of up to 175 miles an hour. It changed course and headed for Dominica quite unexpectedly and nearly unpredictably. Before the hurricane, the economy of the Commonwealth of Dominica, like that of the rest of the Caribbean was an open economy\u2014imports equalled about 70 per cent of the gross domestic product. It was predominantly based on agriculture and it was monopolized by bananas, which accounted for approximately 80 per cent of our foreign-exchange earnings, Added to this was the susceptibility of that crop to external fluctuations in prices and the vagaries of nature, uncontrollable by the Dominican producers.\n21.\tDuring the past few years, the island faced continued balance-of-payments deficits. The economy grew during the 1960s but underwent prolonged contraction during this decade, with a real annual growth in its gross domestic product of 3.5 per cent, concurrent with population growth of 1.6 per cent and aggravated by decline in banana output and per capita income at an average annual rate of 6 per cent. In addition to a fall in the gross domestic product by 12 per cent by 1974, the economy faced severe problems.\n22.\tAt this time the oil crisis reared its head and sent prices and production costs catapulting. Fertilizer price rises outstripped increases in farm gate prices, agricultural exports fell by 15 per cent, manufacturing stagnated with the closing down of pumice and timber industries in 1975 and tourism fell, owing to world recession and bad publicity for the island. The trade account contracted, with real imports falling by 30 per cent and exports by 10 per cent. Imports of machinery and manufactured goods fell by 50 per cent, reflecting a stagnation of investment and a reduction in local consumption. The Government was unable to eliminate continuous current deficits, despite the imposition of successively higher taxes. Revenues could not be maintained in real terms, and the economy declined throughout the period, reducing the potential revenue base. Budgetary grants, together with commercial bank credit and financing by the social security fund, were insufficient to cover growing deficits.\n23.\tBy the end of 1977, the situation had worsened. A six-week strike by the civil service in September 1977 paralysed the economy. The severing of air and sea links put an end to imports for the period. The 1977 current account reflected a deficit of $4.5 million from the emergency assistance programme administered by the Caribbean Development Bank. The finances for 1977-1978 saw further deterioration with the settlement of the civil servants' strike by payment of $5.4 million, which was equal to 27 per cent of the previous year\u2019s current revenue.\n24 Further, in 1978 banana production continued to fall with 4,000 acres having to be destroyed during November and December of 1978 owing to the ravages of a disease that caught the industry flat-footed. The only sector of the economy that experienced some success was soap production, which doubled due to the importation of palm-oil. The coconut industry also saw some economic growth owing to the demand for coconuts in Europe and the Caribbean as well as the shortage of vegetable oils and fats on the world market.\n25.\tIt was in the light of that bleak situation that the Government, in stating its aims to achieve economic development, saw them as being to improve the quality of life of the rural population to raise the standard of living of the entire population by increasing the level of economic activities, thereby providing greater opportunity for remunerative employment for the people of the country, to meet the nutritional requirements of the population, and to provide greater economic flexibility by the diversification of agriculture. Up to 29 August of this year every possible avenue had to be exploited to realize those aims.\n26.\tHowever, Hurricane David made the foregoing sad tale dismal. In the Commonwealth of Dominica, as of 29 August 1979, there were no coconuts, no bananas and hardly any citrus and ground crops. In addition, Hurricane David blew and washed away our already weak infrastructure: our port facilities are almost completely destroyed; we have no hydroelectricity or other electricity; there is no internal telephone communication, and the villages cannot be reached by that means of communication; several of our main and agriculture feeder-roads have been severely damaged or washed away and will not be repaired for a considerable time; nearly every school and other government building has been structurally damaged or destroyed. To date, we are having difficulty instituting the semblance of a resumption of class-room activities, and our school population is consequently adrift, either at home and out of school, or abroad in school away from home.\n27.\tSome 60,000 of our population are at the moment homeless, except for temporary improvised shelters which are not necessarily structurally sound or even healthy; the others who are homeless live in tents and public buildings that had not been blown away or badly damaged. Our already high incidence of joblessness is phenomenally aggravated.\n28.\tIn brief, Dominica stands destroyed and in need of all the international assistance it can get. But our spirit and our sense of pride and fair play have not been daunted by the experience. We remain unwilling to allow opportunists to exploit our situation of need for the purpose of making international or regional ideological capital to the ultimate detriment of the people of the Commonwealth of Dominica.\n29.\tAnd so, the four aims which the Commonwealth of Dominica had set itself have assumed greater paramount urgency and immediacy. We have the greatest faith, a faith that is as clear and unambiguous as far as we are concerned, that the international community will listen to our plea. We therefore make a special appeal in the clearest language\u2014the language of the heart\u2014for over-all assistance in this our hour of suffering and need. The Commonwealth of Dominica is in need of complete reconstruction.\n30.\tWe hope that whatever further assistance may be forthcoming in response to the present appeal and as a result of the study of our situation at home undertaken by ECLA \u2014whose findings we trust will be circulated through this Assembly to Governments throughout the World\u2014will be consistent with the genuine needs of the Commonwealth of Dominica, as signified by our Government. We wish this fact to be generally known and recognized. I have used the expression 'further assistance' in the fullest awareness, because our boundless gratitude must go to the many Governments and agencies which rushed so quickly to the rescue of our country and people in an effort to provide immediate relief assistance, and to so many others that have made pledges of assistance which, we hope, will materialize as a matter of urgency.\n31.\tI wish to thank publicly all those Governments, organizations and agencies which have assisted or offered to assist. To those which have already assisted, we say we would appreciate any further assistance, if they are in a position to give it. To those who have not yet offered or have not been given an opportunity to make an offer, we say that we are still in need and can do with any assistance compatible with that need. To the United Nations itself and its administration we say, 'sincerest thanks for your expressions of sympathy and your assistance.' We have every confidence that the Organization will continue to make tangible demonstrations of its concern and solicitude.\n32.\tTo all we say that the immediate and paramount task that lies ahead for the Commonwealth of Dominica is the over-all reconstruction of our country in the wake of a natural disaster over which man had absolutely no control, despite his technological and sophisticated advances.\n33.\tReconstruction effort is therefore only primarily Dominica's responsibility; but in a 'global village' and in the spirit of brotherhood, international peace, stability and co-operation, we hope the international community will not leave it to the Commonwealth of Dominica and Dominicans alone. The Commonwealth of Dominica is down, but not out. We are confident that, by the grace of the Almighty and the help of our friends, we will rebuild our country.\n34.\tWe conclude with a reiteration of our congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election to that position of grave responsibility and our expression of hope for a fruitful and successful term of office.\n35.\tAs a new Member of the United Nations, we wish to let it be known that we stand by the principles and purposes of the United Nations Charter. We respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of every nation, large or small. We respect each nation's sovereign right to make its own decisions, and we stipulate the concomitant duty and obligation of other States to respect that decision. A compelling corollary of the principle of territorial integrity is the sovereign right to control ownership by the State of its natural resources. We deprecate any attempt, overt or covert, to interfere in the internal affairs of sovereign States. International indications appear to be that the majority of the world's peoples, particularly in the third world, are for equitable international intercourse in the economic and other areas, without pressure to align with one antiquated ideological bloc or the other. The Commonwealth of Dominica identifies with that mood and feels that any attempt from any quarter to counter or reverse it may well be foolhardy at best and disruptive of international peace.\n36.\tI am aware that I have not dealt with any problems which confront our Organization today, and more especially those which are of particular importance to the Commonwealth of Dominica, such as the proposed convention on the law of the sea, and that much time has been taken in bringing to the attention of this body the singular problems of the Commonwealth of Dominica. However, this is not through an oversight, but rather because I am guided by the need to expose to the world community the abject constraints which impede our ability as a recently independent mini-State to stand up to the economic and political winds that are storming throughout the third world.\n37.\tIt is our expectation that the constant and ceaseless expressions of good faith and good intention of Member States will now find an available repository in the Commonwealth of Dominica.\n38.\tWe look forward to our continued and permanent participation in the affairs of this Organization. We wish to maintain and justify the confidence of all free and recently independent nations that, in our newly found relationships with our former masters and expected brothers in the community of nations, all the resources available to the world will shortly be harnessed for the common good, realizing as we do that equity is the foundation upon which the era of the 1980s will allow for the universal solution of problems that will be resolved through peace, goodwill and solidarity.","completion":"spoken"}
{"prompt":" The following is a conversation with Jan LeCun. He's considered to be one of the fathers of deep learning, which, if you've been hiding under a rock, is the recent revolution in AI that has captivated the world with the possibility of what machines can learn from data. He's a professor at New York University, a vice president and chief AI scientist at Facebook, and co-recipient of the Turing Award for his work on deep learning. He's probably best known as the founding father of convolutional neural networks, in particular, their application to optical character recognition and the famed MNIST dataset. He is also an outspoken personality, unafraid to speak his mind in a distinctive French accent and explore provocative ideas, both in the rigorous medium of academic research and the somewhat less rigorous medium of Twitter and Facebook. This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast. If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube, give it five stars on iTunes, support it on Patreon, or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Friedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N. And now, here's my conversation with Jan LeCun. You said that 2001, Space Odyssey is one of your favorite movies. Hal 9000 decides to get rid of the astronauts for people who haven't seen the movie, spoil alert, because he, it, she believes that the astronauts, they will interfere with the mission. Do you see Hal as flawed in some fundamental way or even evil, or did he do the right thing? Neither. There's no notion of evil in that context, other than the fact that people die. But it was an example of what people call value misalignment, right? You give an objective to a machine and the machine tries to achieve this objective. And if you don't put any constraints on this objective, like don't kill people and don't do things like this, the machine, given the power, will do stupid things just to achieve this objective, or damaging things to achieve this objective. It's a little bit like, I mean, we're used to this in the context of human society. We put in place laws to prevent people from doing bad things because spontaneously they would do those bad things, right? So we have to shape their cost function, their objective function, if you want, through laws to kind of correct, and education, obviously, to sort of correct for those. So maybe just pushing a little further on that point, Hal, you know, there's a mission. There's a, there's fuzziness around the ambiguity around what the actual mission is. But, you know, do you think that there will be a time from a utilitarian perspective where an AI system, where it is not misalignment, where it is alignment for the greater good of society, that an AI system will make decisions that are difficult? Well, that's the trick. I mean, eventually we'll have to figure out how to do this. And again, we're not starting from scratch because we've been doing this with humans for millennia. So designing objective functions for people is something that we know how to do. And we don't do it by, you know, programming things, although the legal code is called code. So that tells you something. And it's actually the design of an objective function. That's really what legal code is, right? It tells you, here is what you can do, here is what you can't do. If you do it, you pay that much. That's an objective function. So there is this idea somehow that it's a new thing for people to try to design objective functions that are aligned with the common good. But no, we've been writing laws for millennia and that's exactly what it is. So that's where, you know, the science of lawmaking and computer science will- Come together. Will come together. So it's nothing, there's nothing special about HAL or AI systems. It's just the continuation of tools used to make some of these difficult ethical judgments that laws make. Yeah, and we have systems like this already that make many decisions for ourselves in society that need to be designed in a way that they, like rules about things that sometimes have bad side effects. And we have to be flexible enough about those rules so that they can be broken when it's obvious that they shouldn't be applied. So you don't see this on the camera here, but all the decoration in this room is all pictures from 2001 in Space Odyssey. Wow, is that by accident or is there a lot- It's not by accident, it's by design. Oh, wow. So if you were to build HAL 10,000, so an improvement of HAL 9,000, what would you improve? Well, first of all, I wouldn't ask you to hold secrets and tell lies because that's really what breaks it in the end. That's the fact that it's asking itself questions about the purpose of the mission and it's, you know, pieces things together that it's heard, you know, all the secrets of the preparation of the mission and the fact that it was a discovery on the lunar surface that really was kept secret. And one part of HAL's memory knows this and the other part does not know it and is supposed to not tell anyone and that creates internal conflict. So you think there's never should be a set of things that an AI system should not be allowed, like a set of facts that should not be shared to the human operators. Well, I think, no, I think it should be a bit like in the design of autonomous AI systems, there should be the equivalent of, you know, the oath that Hippocrates- Hippocrates oath, yeah. That doctors sign up to, right? So there's certain things, certain rules that you have to abide by and we can sort of hardwire this into our machines to kind of make sure they don't go. So I'm not, you know, an advocate of the three laws of robotics, you know, the Asimov kind of thing because I don't think it's practical, but you know, some level of limits. But to be clear, this is not, these are not questions that are kind of really worth asking today because we just don't have the technology to do this. We don't have autonomous intelligence machines. We have intelligence machines, some are intelligence machines that are very specialized, but they don't really sort of satisfy an objective. They're just, you know, kind of trained to do one thing. So until we have some idea for design of a full-fledged autonomous intelligence system, asking the question of how we design this objective, I think is a little too abstract. It's a little too abstract. There's useful elements to it in that it helps us understand our own ethical codes, our humans. So even just as a thought experiment, if you imagine that an AI system is here today, how would we program it? Is a kind of nice thought experiment of constructing how should we have a law, have a system of laws for us humans. It's just a nice practical tool. And I think there's echoes of that idea too in the AI systems we have today that don't have to be that intelligent. Like autonomous vehicles. These things start creeping in that they're worth thinking about, but certainly they shouldn't be framed as hell. Yeah. Looking back, what is the most, I'm sorry if it's a silly question, but what is the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning or AI in general that you've ever come across? Sort of personally, when you said back and just had this kind of, oh, that's pretty cool moment. That's nice. That's surprising. I don't know if it's an idea rather than a sort of empirical fact. The fact that you can build gigantic neural nets, train them on relatively small amounts of data relatively with stochastic grid and descent, and that it actually works, breaks everything you read in every textbook, right? Every pre-deep learning textbook that told you you need to have fewer parameters and you have data samples. If you have a non-convex objective function, you have no guarantee of convergence. All those things that you read in textbook and they tell you to stay away from this, and they're all wrong. A huge number of parameters, non-convex, and somehow, which is very relative to the number of parameters, data, it's able to learn anything. Does that still surprise you today? Well, it was kind of obvious to me before I knew anything that this is a good idea, and then it became surprising that it worked because I started reading those textbooks. Okay. Okay, so can you talk through the intuition of why it was obvious to you, if you remember? Well, okay, so the intuition was, it's sort of like those people in the late 19th century who proved that heavier than air flight was impossible, and of course you have birds, right? They do fly, and so on the face of it, it's obviously wrong as an empirical question, right? And so we have the same kind of thing that, we know that the brain works, we don't know how, but we know it works, and we know it's a large network of neurons and interaction, and that learning takes place by changing the connections. So kind of getting this level of inspiration without copying the details, but sort of trying to derive basic principles, you know, that kind of gives you a clue as to which direction to go. There's also the idea somehow that I've been convinced of since I was an undergrad, that even before, that intelligence is inseparable from learning. So the idea somehow that you can create an intelligent machine by basically programming, for me, was an on-starter from the start. Every intelligent entity that we know about arrives at this intelligence through learning. So machine learning was a completely obvious path, also because I'm lazy, so, you know, kind of. You automate basically everything, and learning is the automation of intelligence. Right. So do you think, so what is learning then? What falls under learning? Because do you think of reasoning as learning? Well, reasoning is certainly a consequence of learning as well, just like other functions of the brain. The big question about reasoning is, how do you make reasoning compatible with gradient-based learning? Do you think neural networks can be made to reason? Yes, there is no question about that. Again, we have a good example, right? The question is how. So the question is how much prior structure do you have to put in the neural net so that something like human reasoning will emerge from it, you know, from learning? Another question is all of our kind of model of what reasoning is that are based on logic are discrete and are therefore incompatible with gradient-based learning. And I'm a very strong believer in this idea of gradient-based learning. I don't believe that other types of learning that don't use kind of gradient information if you want. So you don't like discrete mathematics. You don't like anything discrete? Well, it's not that I don't like it. It's just that it's incompatible with learning, and I'm a big fan of learning, right? So in fact, that's perhaps one reason why deep learning has been kind of looked at with suspicion by a lot of computer scientists because the math is very different. The math that you use for deep learning, you know, it kind of has more to do with, you know, cybernetics, the kind of math you do in electrical engineering than the kind of math you do in computer science. And, you know, nothing in machine learning is exact, right? Computer science is all about sort of, you know, obviously compulsive attention to details of like, you know, every index has to be right, and you can prove that an algorithm is correct, right? Machine learning is the science of sloppiness, really. That's beautiful. So, okay, maybe let's feel around in the dark of what is a neural network that reasons, or a system that works with continuous functions that's able to do, build knowledge, however we think about reasoning, build on previous knowledge, build on extra knowledge, create new knowledge, generalize outside of any training set ever built. What does that look like? Yeah, maybe, do you have inklings of thoughts of what that might look like? Yeah, I mean, yes and no. If I had precise ideas about this, I think, you know, we'd be building it right now. But, and there are people working on this who's main research interest is actually exactly that, right? So what you need to have is a working memory. So you need to have some device, if you want, some subsystem that can store a relatively large number of factual episodic information for, you know, a reasonable amount of time. So, you know, in the brain, for example, there are kind of three main types of memory. One is the sort of memory of the state of your cortex. And that sort of disappears within 20 seconds. You can't remember things for more than about 20 seconds or a minute if you don't have any other form of memory. The second type of memory, which is longer term, it's still short term, is the hippocampus. So you can, you know, you came into this building, you remember where the exit is, where the elevators are. You have some map of that building that's stored in your hippocampus. You might remember something about what I said, you know, a few minutes ago. I forgot it all already, but it's part. It's been erased, but you know, but that would be in your hippocampus. And then the longer term memory is in the synapses, right? So what you need if you want a system that's capable of reasoning is that you want the hippocampus-like thing, right? And that's what people have tried to do with memory networks and, you know, neural-terrain machines and stuff like that, right? And now with transformers, which have sort of a memory in their kind of self-attention system. You can think of it this way. So that's one element you need. Another thing you need is some sort of network that can access this memory, get an information back and then kind of crunch on it and then do this iteratively multiple times, because a chain of reasoning is a process by which you update your knowledge about the state of the world, about, you know, what's gonna happen, et cetera. And that has to be this sort of recurrent operation basically. And you think that kind of, if we think about a transformer, so that seems to be too small to contain the knowledge that's to represent the knowledge that's contained in Wikipedia, for example. But a transformer doesn't have this idea of recurrence. It's got a fixed number of layers and that's the number of steps that, you know, limits basically its representation. But recurrence would build on the knowledge somehow. I mean, it would evolve the knowledge and expand the amount of information perhaps or useful information within that knowledge. But is this something that just can emerge with size? Because it seems like everything we have now is too small. No, it's not clear. I mean, how you access and write into an associative memory in an efficient way. I mean, sort of the original memory network maybe had something like the right architecture, but if you try to scale up a memory network so that the memory contains all of Wikipedia, it doesn't quite work. Right. So there's a need for new ideas there, okay. But it's not the only form of reasoning. So there's another form of reasoning, which is true, which is very classical also in some types of AI and is based on, let's call it energy minimization. Okay, so you have some sort of objective, some energy function that represents the quality or the negative quality, okay. Energy goes up when things get bad and they get low when things get good. So let's say you want to figure out, what gestures do I need to do to grab an object or walk out the door. If you have a good model of your own body, a good model of the environment, using this kind of energy minimization, you can do planning. And it's in optimal control, it's called model predictive control. You have a model of what's gonna happen in the world as a consequence of your actions. And that allows you to buy energy minimization, figure out the sequence of action that optimizes a particular objective function, which measures, you know, minimize the number of times you're gonna hit something and the energy you're gonna spend doing the gesture and et cetera. So that's a form of reasoning. Planning is a form of reasoning. And perhaps what led to the ability of humans to reason is the fact that, or, you know, species, you know, that appear before us had to do some sort of planning to be able to hunt and survive and survive the winter in particular. And so, you know, it's the same capacity that you need to have. So in your intuition is, if we look at expert systems and encoding knowledge as logic systems, as graphs, in this kind of way, is not a useful way to think about knowledge? Graphs are a little brittle or logic representation. So basically, you know, variables that have values and then constraint between them that are represented by rules is a little too rigid and too brittle, right? So one of the, you know, some of the early efforts in that respect were to put probabilities on them. So a rule, you know, you know, if you have this and that symptom, you know, you have this disease with that probability and you should prescribe that antibiotic with that probability, right? That's the mysyn system from the 70s. And that's what that branch of AI led to, you know, based on networks and graphical models and causal inference and variational, you know, method. So there is, I mean, certainly a lot of interesting work going on in this area. The main issue with this is knowledge acquisition. How do you reduce a bunch of data to a graph of this type? Yeah, it relies on the expert to, on the human being to encode, to add knowledge. And that's essentially impractical. Yeah. So that's a big question. The second question is, do you want to represent knowledge as symbols and do you want to manipulate them with logic? And again, that's incompatible with learning. So one suggestion with, you know, Jeff Hinton has been advocating for many decades is replace symbols by vectors. Think of it as pattern of activities in a bunch of neurons or units or whatever you want to call them and replace logic by continuous functions. Okay. And that becomes now compatible. This is a very good set of ideas by written in a paper about 10 years ago by Leon Boutou who is here at Facebook. The title of the paper is From Machine Learning to Machine Reasoning. And his idea is that a learning system should be able to manipulate objects that are in a space and then put the result back in the same space. So it's this idea of working memory basically. And it's very enlightening. And in a sense that might learn something like the simple expert systems. I mean, you can learn basic logic operations there. Yeah, quite possibly. Yeah. And then there's a debate on sort of how much prior structure you have to put in for this kind of stuff to emerge. That's the debate I have with Gary Marcus and people like that. Yeah. Yeah. So, and the other person, so I just talked to Judea Pearl from the dimension causal inference world. So his worry is that the current neural networks are not able to learn what causes what causal inference between things. So I think he's right and wrong about this. If he's talking about the sort of classic type of neural nets, people sort of didn't worry too much about this. But there's a lot of people now working on causal inference. And there's a paper that just came out last week by Leon Butu among others, David Lopez Paz and a bunch of other people. Exactly on that problem of how do you kind of, get a neural net to sort of pay attention to real causal relationships, which may also solve issues of bias in data and things like this. I'd like to read that paper because that ultimately, the challenge is also seems to fall back on the human expert to ultimately decide causality between things. People are not very good at establishing causality, first of all. So first of all, you talk to physicists and physicists actually don't believe in causality because look at all the basic laws of microphysics are time reversible. So there's no causality. The arrow of time is not real. It's as soon as you start looking at macroscopic systems where there is unpredictable randomness, where there is clearly an arrow of time, but it's a big mystery in physics actually, how that emerges. Is it emergent or is it part of the fundamental fabric of reality? Or is it a bias of intelligent systems that because of the second law of thermodynamics, we perceive a particular arrow of time, but in fact, it's kind of arbitrary, right? So yeah, physicists, mathematicians, they don't care about, I mean, the math doesn't care about the flow of time. Well, certainly microphysics doesn't. People themselves are not very good at establishing causal relationships. If you ask, I think it was in one of Seymour Papert's book on like children learning. He studied with Jean Piaget. He's the guy who coauthored the book, Perceptron with Marvin Minsky, that kind of killed the first wave of neural nets. But he was actually a learning person in the sense of studying learning in humans and machines. That's why he got interested in perceptron. And he wrote that if you ask a little kid about what is the cause of the wind, a lot of kids will say, they will think for a while and they'll say, oh, it's the branches in the trees. They move and that creates wind, right? So they get the causal relationship backwards. And it's because their understanding of the world and intuitive physics is not that great, right? I mean, these are like four or five year old kids. You know, it gets better and then you understand that this, it can be, right? But there are many things which we can, because of our common sense understanding of things, what people call common sense, and our understanding of physics, we can, there's a lot of stuff that we can figure out causality, even with diseases, we can figure out what's not causing what often. There's a lot of mystery, of course, but the idea is that you should be able to encode that into systems because it seems unlikely to be able to figure that out themselves. Well, whenever we can do intervention, but you know, all of humanity has been completely diluted for millennia, probably since its existence, about a very, very wrong causal relationship where whatever you can explain, you attribute it to some deity, some divinity, right? And that's a cop out. That's a way of saying like, I don't know the cause, so, you know, God did it, right? So you mentioned Marvin Minsky and the irony of, you know, maybe causing the first AI winter. You were there in the 90s, you were there in the 80s, of course, in the 90s, why do you think people lost faith in deep learning in the 90s and found it again a decade later, over a decade later? Yeah, it wasn't called deep learning yet, it was just called neural nets. Neural networks. Yeah, they lost interest. I mean, I think I would put that around 1995, at least the machine learning community. There was always a neural net community, but it became kind of disconnected from sort of mainstream machine learning, if you want. There were, it was basically electrical engineering that kept at it and computer science. Just gave up. Gave up on neural nets. I don't know, you know, I was too close to it to really sort of analyze it with sort of a unbiased eye, if you want, but I would make a few guesses. So the first one is, at the time, neural nets were, it was very hard to make them work, in the sense that you would implement backprop in your favorite language. And that favorite language was not Python, it was not MATLAB, it was not any of those things, because they didn't exist, right? You had to write it in Fortran OC or something like this, right? So you would experiment with it. You would probably make some very basic mistakes, like badly initialize your weights, make the network too small because you read it in a textbook, you don't want too many parameters, right? And of course, and you would train on XOR because you didn't have any other data set to try it on. And of course, it works half the time. So you'd say, I give up. Also you would train it with batch gradient, which isn't really sufficient. So there was a lot of, there's bad good tricks that you had to know to make those things work, or you had to reinvent, and a lot of people just didn't, and they just couldn't make it work. So that's one thing. The investment in software platform to be able to kind of display things, figure out why things don't work, kind of get a good intuition for how to get them to work, have enough flexibility so you can create network architectures like convolutional nets and stuff like that. It was hard. I mean, you had to write everything from scratch. And again, you didn't have any Python or MATLAB or anything, right? I read that, sorry to interrupt, but I read that you wrote in Lisp, the first versions of a LENET with convolutional networks, which by the way, one of my favorite languages. That's the one I knew you were legit. Touring award, whatever. This is what you programmed in Lisp. It's still my favorite language. But it's not that we programmed in Lisp, it's that we had to write our Lisp interpreter. Okay, because it's not like we use one that existed. So we wrote a Lisp interpreter that we hooked up to, you know, a backend library that we wrote also for sort of neural net computation. And then after a few years, around 1991, we invented this idea of basically having modules that know how to forward propagate and back propagate gradients, and then interconnecting those modules in a graph. Leonbert Hu had made proposals on this, about this in the late 80s, and we were able to implement this using our Lisp system. Eventually we wanted to use that system to build production code for character recognition at Bell Labs. So we actually wrote a compiler for that Lisp interpreter so that Patricia Mard, who is now at Microsoft, kind of did the bulk of it with Leon and me. And so we could write our system in Lisp and then compile to C, and then we'll have a self-contained complete system that could kind of do the entire thing. Neither PyTorch nor Transamflu can do this today. Yet, okay, it's coming. Yeah. I mean, there's something like that in PyTorch called Torch script. And so, you know, we had to write our Lisp interpreter, we had to write our Lisp compiler, we had to invest a huge amount of effort to do this. And not everybody, if you don't completely believe in the concept, you're not going to invest the time to do this. Now, at the time also, you know, where today this would turn into Torch or PyTorch or Transamflu or whatever, we'd put it in open source, everybody would use it and, you know, realize it's good. Back before 1995, working at AT&T, there's no way the lawyers would let you release anything in open source of this nature. And so we could not distribute our code really. And on that point, and sorry to go on a million tangents, but on that point, I also read that there was some almost like a patent on Comma Lusso and Young Networks. Yes, there was. At Bell Labs. So that, first of all, I mean just- There's two actually. Two that ran out. Thankfully, in 2007. In 2007. I wanna, what, can we just talk about that for a sec? I know you're a Facebook, but you're also at NYU. And what does it mean to patent ideas like these software ideas, essentially? Or what are mathematical ideas? Or what are they? Okay, so they're not mathematical ideas. So there are, you know, algorithms. And there was a period where the US patent office would allow the patent of software as long as it was embodied. The Europeans are very different. They don't quite accept that. They have a different concept, but you know. I don't, I no longer, I mean, I never actually strongly believed in this, but I don't believe in this kind of patent. Facebook basically doesn't believe in this kind of patent. Google files patents because they've been burned with Apple. And so now they do this for defensive purpose, but usually they say, we're not gonna sue you if you infringe. Facebook has a similar policy. They say, you know, we file patents on certain things for defensive purpose. We're not gonna sue you if you infringe, unless you sue us. So the industry does not believe in patents. They are there because of, you know, the legal landscape and various things. But I don't really believe in patents for this kind of stuff. So that's a great thing. So I- I'll tell you a worse story actually. So what happens was the first patent about convolutional net was about kind of the early version of convolutional net that didn't have separate pooling layers. It had convolutional layers which tried more than one if you want, right? And then there was a second one on convolutional nets with separate pooling layers, trained with backprop. And there were files filed in 89 and 99D or something like this. At the time, the life of a patent was 17 years. So here's what happened over the next few years is that we started developing character recognition technology around convolutional nets. And in 1994, a check reading system was deployed in ATM machines. In 1995, it was for large check reading machines in back offices, et cetera. And those systems were developed by an engineering group that we were collaborating with at AT&T and they were commercialized by NCR, which at the time was a subsidiary of AT&T. Now AT&T split up in 1996, early 1996. And the lawyers just looked at all the patents and they distributed the patents among the various companies. They gave the convolutional net patent to NCR because they were actually selling products that used it. But nobody at NCR had any idea what a convolutional net was. Yeah. Okay. So between 1996 and 2007, so there's a whole period until 2002 where I didn't actually work on machine learning or convolutional net. I resumed working on this around 2002. And between 2002 and 2007, I was working on them, crossing my finger that nobody at NCR would notice. Nobody noticed. Yeah. And I hope that this kind of somewhat, as you said, lawyers aside, relative openness of the community now will continue. It accelerates the entire progress of the industry. And the problems that Facebook and Google and others are facing today is not whether Facebook or Google or Microsoft or IBM or whoever is ahead of the other, it's that we don't have the technology to build the things we want to build. We want to build intelligent virtual assistants that have common sense. We don't have monopoly on good ideas for this. We don't believe we do. Maybe others believe they do, but we don't. Okay. If a startup tells you they have the secret to human level intelligence and common sense, don't believe them, they don't. And it's going to take the entire work of the world research community for a while to get to the point where you can go off and in each of those companies kind of start to build things on this. We're not there yet. It's absolutely. And this calls to the gap between the space of ideas and the rigorous testing of those ideas. Practical application that you often speak to. You've written advice saying, don't get fooled by people who claim to have a solution to artificial general intelligence, who claim to have an AI system that works just like the human brain or who claim to have figured out how the brain works. Ask them what the error rate they get on MNIST or ImageNet. This is a little dated by the way. I mean, five years, who's counting? Okay. But I think your opinion is that MNIST and ImageNet, yes, maybe dated, there may be new benchmarks, right? But I think that philosophy is one you still and somewhat hold that benchmarks and the practical testing, the practical application is where you really get to test the ideas. Well, it may not be completely practical. Like for example, it could be a toy data set, but it has to be some sort of task that the community as a whole has accepted as a tool. It has to be interpreted as some sort of standard, kind of benchmark if you want. It doesn't need to be real. So for example, many years ago here at FAIR, Jason West and Antoine Bourne and a few others proposed the Babi tasks, which were kind of a toy problem to test the ability of machines to reason actually to access working memory and things like this. And it was very useful, even though it wasn't a real task. MNIST is kind of halfway real task. So toy problems can be very useful. But I was really struck by the fact that a lot of people, particularly a lot of people with money to invest would be fooled by people telling them, oh, we have the algorithm of the cortex and you should give us 50 million. Yes, absolutely. So there's a lot of people who try to take advantage of the hype for business reasons and so on. But let me sort of talk to this idea that the new ideas, the ideas that push the field forward may not yet have a benchmark, or it may be very difficult to establish a benchmark. I agree, that's part of the process. Establishing benchmarks is part of the process. So what are your thoughts about, so we have these benchmarks on around stuff we can do with images from classification to captioning to just every kind of information you can pull off from images and the surface level. There's audio data sets, there's some video. What can we start, natural language, what kind of stuff, what kind of benchmarks do you see that start creeping on to more something like intelligence, like reasoning, like maybe you don't like the term, but AGI echoes of that kind of formulation. A lot of people are working on interactive environments in which you can train and test intelligence systems. So there, for example, it's the classical paradigm of supervised learning is that you have a data set, you partition it into a training set, validation set, test set, and there's a clear protocol. But what if that assumes that the samples are statistically independent, you can exchange them, the order in which you see them shouldn't matter, things like that. But what if the answer you give determines the next sample you see, which is the case, for example, in robotics. A robot does something and then it gets exposed to a new room and depending on where it goes, the room would be different. So that creates the exploration problem. What if the samples, so that creates also a dependency between samples. If you can only move in space, the next sample you're gonna see is gonna be probably in the same building, most likely. So all the assumptions about the validity of this training set, test set hypothesis break whenever a machine can take an action that has an influence in the world and it's what it's gonna see. So people are setting up artificial environments where that takes place, right? The robot runs around a 3D model of a house and can interact with objects and things like this. So you do robotics by simulation, you have those, opening a gym type thing or Mujoko kind of simulated robots and you have games, things like that. So that's where the field is going really, this kind of environment. Now, back to the question of AGI. Like I don't like the term AGI because it implies that human intelligence is general and human intelligence is nothing like general. It's very, very specialized. We think it's general, we'd like to think of ourselves as having general intelligence, we don't. We're very specialized. We're only slightly more general than- Why does it feel general? So you kind of, the term general. I think what's impressive about humans is ability to learn as we were talking about learning, to learn in just so many different domains. It's perhaps not arbitrarily general, but just you can learn in many domains and integrate that knowledge somehow. Okay. That knowledge persists. So let me take a very specific example. Yes. It's not an example, it's more like a quasi mathematical demonstration. So you have about 1 million fibers coming out of one of your eyes, okay, 2 million total. But let's talk about just one of them. It's 1 million nerve fibers, your optical nerve. Let's imagine that they are binary, so they can be active or inactive, right? So the input to your visual cortex is 1 million bits. Now, they're connected to your brain in a particular way and they're connected to your brain in a particular way and your brain has connections that are kind of a little bit like a convolution that they're kind of local, you know, in space and things like this. Now imagine I play a trick on you. It's a pretty nasty trick, I admit. I cut your optical nerve and I put a device that makes a random perturbation of, a permutation of all the nerve fibers. So now what comes to your brain is a fixed but random permutation of all the pixels. There's no way in hell that your visual cortex, even if I do this to you in infancy, will actually run vision to the same level of quality that you can. Got it, and you're saying there's no way you've relearned that? No, because now two pixels that are nearby in the world will end up in very different places in your visual cortex and your neurons there have no connections with each other because they only connect it locally. So this whole, our entire, the hardware is built in many ways to support. The locality of the real world. Yeah. Yes, that's specialization. Yeah, but it's still pretty damn impressive. So it's not perfect generalization. It's not even close. No, no, it's not that it's not even close. It's not at all. Yeah, it's not, it's specialized, yeah. So how many Boolean functions, so let's imagine you want to train your visual system to recognize particular patterns of those one million bits. Okay, so that's a Boolean function, right? Either the pattern is here or not here. This is a two way classification with one million binary inputs. How many such Boolean functions are there? Okay, you have two to the one million combinations of inputs, for each of those you have an output bit. And so you have two to the one million Boolean functions of this type, okay? Which is an unimaginably large number. How many of those functions can actually be computed by your visual cortex? And the answer is a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny sliver, like an enormously tiny sliver. Yeah, yeah. So we are ridiculously specialized. Okay. But, okay, that's an argument against the word general. I think there's a, I agree with your intuition, but I'm not sure it seems the brain is impressively capable of adjusting to things. It's because we can't imagine tasks that are outside of our comprehension, right? So we think we are general because we are general of all the things that we can apprehend. So yeah. But there is a huge world out there of things that we have no idea. We call that heat, by the way. Heat. Heat. So at least physicists call that heat, or they call it entropy, which is kind of. You have a thing full of gas, right? Closed system for gas. Right? Close or not closed. It has pressure, it has temperature, it has, you know, and you can write equations, PV equal to nRT, things like that, right? When you reduce the volume, the temperature goes up, the pressure goes up, you know, things like that, right? For perfect gas, at least. Those are the things you can know about that system. And it's a tiny, tiny number of bits compared to the complete information of the state of the entire system, because the state of the entire system will give you the position and momentum of every molecule of the gas. And what you don't know about it is the entropy, and you interpret it as heat. The energy contained in that thing is what we call heat. Now, it's very possible that, in fact, there is some very strong structure in how those molecules are moving. It's just that they are in a way that we are just not wired to perceive. Yeah, we're ignorant to it. And there's, in your infinite amount of things, we're not wired to perceive. You're right, that's a nice way to put it. We're general to all the things we can imagine, which is a very tiny subset of all things that are possible. It's like chromograph complexity or the chromatography of complexity. Yeah. You know, every bit string or every integer is random, except for all the ones that you can actually write down. Yeah, okay, so beautifully put. So we can just call it artificial intelligence. We don't need to have a general. Or human level. Human level intelligence is good. You know, you'll start, any time you touch human, it gets interesting because, you know, it's because we attach ourselves to human and it's difficult to define what human intelligence is. Yeah. Nevertheless, my definition is maybe demo-impressive intelligence, okay? Demo-impressive, demonstration of intelligence, whatever. And so on that topic, most successes in deep learning have been in supervised learning. Mm-hmm. What is your view on unsupervised learning? Is there a hope to reduce involvement of human input and still have successful systems that have practical use? Yeah, I mean, there's definitely a hope. It's more than a hope, actually. It's, you know, mounting evidence for it. And that's basically all I do, like, the only thing I'm interested in at the moment is, I call it self-supervised learning, not unsupervised. Because unsupervised learning is a loaded term. People who know something about machine learning, you know, tell you, so you're doing clustering or PCA, which is not the case. Right, right. And the wide public, you know, when you say unsupervised learning, oh my God, you know, machines are gonna learn by themselves and without supervision. You know, they see this as- Where's the parents? Yeah, so I call it self-supervised learning because, in fact, the underlying, that I use are the same algorithms as the supervised learning algorithms. Except that what we train them to do is not predict a particular set of variables, like the category of an image, and not to predict a set of variables that have been provided by human labelers. But what you train the machine to do is, basically, reconstruct a piece of its input that it's being, that it's being used to predict. That it's being masked out, essentially. You can think of it this way, right? So show a piece of video to a machine and ask it to predict what's gonna happen next. And of course, after a while, you can show what happens and the machine will kind of train itself to do better at that task. You can do, like all the latest, most successful models in natural language processing use self-supervised learning. You know, sort of BERT style systems, for example, right? You show it a window of a dozen words on a text corpus. You take out 15% of the words, and then you train the machine to predict the words that are missing that self-supervised learning. It's not predicting the future. It's just predicting things in the middle, but you could have you predict the future. That's what language models do. So you construct, so in an unsupervised way, you construct a model of language. Do you think- Or video or the physical world or whatever, right? How far do you think that can take us? Do you think BERT understands anything? To some level, it has a shallow understanding of text, but it needs to, I mean, to have kind of true human level intelligence, I think you need to ground language in reality. So some people are attempting to do this, right? Having the systems that kind of have some visual representation of what is being talked about, which is one reason you need those interactive environments actually. But this is like a huge technical problem that is not solved, and that explains why self-supervised learning works in the context of natural language, but does not work in the context, or at least not well, in the context of image recognition and video, although it's making progress quickly. And the reason, that reason is the fact that it's much easier to represent uncertainty in the prediction in the context of natural language than it is in the context of things like video and images. So for example, if I ask you to predict what words are missing, 15% of the words that are taken out. The possibilities are small. I mean, it's small, right? There is a hundred thousand words in the lexicon, and what the machine spits out is a big probability vector, right? It's a bunch of numbers between zero and one that's onto one. And we know how to do this with computers. So there, representing uncertainty in the prediction is relatively easy, and that's, in my opinion, why those techniques work for NLP. For images, if you ask, if you block a piece of an image and you ask the system, reconstruct that piece of the image, there are many possible answers. They are all perfectly legit, right? And how do you represent this set of possible answers? You can't train a system to make one prediction. You can't train a neural net to say, here it is, that's the image, because there's a whole set of things that are compatible with it. So how do you get the machine to represent not a single output, but a whole set of outputs? And similarly with video prediction, there's a lot of things that can happen in the future of video. You're looking at me right now, I'm not moving my head very much, but I might turn my head to the left or to the right. Right. If you don't have a system that can predict this and you train it with least square to kind of minimize the error with a prediction and what I'm doing, what you get is a blurry image of myself in all possible future positions that I might be in, which is not a good prediction. But so there might be other ways to do the self-supervision, right? For visual scenes. Like what? If I knew, I wouldn't tell you, I'd publish it first, I don't know. No, there might be. So I mean, these are kind of, there might be artificial ways of like self-play in games to where you can simulate part of the environment. Oh, that doesn't solve the problem. It's just a way of generating data. But because you have more of a control, like maybe you can control, yeah, it's a way to generate data. That's right. And because you can do huge amounts of data generation, that doesn't, you're right. Well, it creeps up on the problem from the side of data and you don't think that's the right way to creep up on it. It doesn't solve this problem of handling uncertainty in the world, right? So if you have a machine, learn a predictive model of the world in a game that is deterministic or quasi-deterministic, it's easy, right? Just give a few frames of the game to a conv net, put a bunch of layers, and then have the game generates the next few frames. And if the game is deterministic, it works fine. And that includes feeding the system with the action that your little character is gonna take. The problem comes from the fact that the real world and most games are not entirely predictable. And so there you get those blurry predictions and you can't do planning with blurry predictions. Right, so if you have a perfect model of the world, you can, in your head, run this model with a hypothesis for a sequence of actions, and you're going to predict the outcome of that sequence of actions. But if your model is imperfect, how can you plan? Yeah, it quickly explodes. What are your thoughts on the extension of this, which topic I'm super excited about, it's connected to something you were talking about in terms of robotics, is active learning. So as opposed to sort of completely unsupervised or self-explanatory, self-supervised learning, you ask the system for human help, for selecting parts you want annotated next. So if you think about a robot exploring a space or a baby exploring a space, or a system exploring a dataset, every once in a while asking for human input, do you see value in that kind of work? I don't see transformative value. It's going to make things that we can already do more efficient, or they will learn slightly more efficiently, but it's not going to make machines sort of significantly more intelligent. I think, and by the way, there is no opposition, there is no conflict between self-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and supervised learning, or imitation learning, or active learning. I see self-supervised learning as a preliminary to all of the above. Yes. So the example I use very often is, how is it that, so if you use classical reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning, if you want, the best methods today, so-called model-free reinforcement learning to learn to play Atari games, take about 80 hours of training to reach the level that any human can reach in about 15 minutes. They get better than humans, but it takes them a long time. AlphaStar, the, you know, Ariel Vinyals and his team's system to play StarCraft, plays a single map, a single type of player, and can reach better than human level with about the equivalent of 200 years of training, playing against itself. It's 200 years, right? It's not something that no human can, could ever do. I mean, I'm not sure what lesson to take away from that. Okay, now take those algorithms, the best RL algorithms we have today, to train a car to drive itself. It would probably have to drive millions of hours. It will have to kill thousands of pedestrians. It will have to run into thousands of trees. It will have to run off cliffs. And it had to run off cliff multiple times before it figures out that it's a bad idea, first of all. And second of all, before it figures out how not to do it. And so, I mean, this type of learning obviously does not reflect the kind of learning that animals and humans do. There is something missing that's really, really important there. And my hypothesis, which I've been advocating for like five years now, is that we have predictive models of the world that include the ability to predict under uncertainty. And what allows us to not run off a cliff when we learn to drive, most of us can learn to drive in about 20 or 30 hours of training without ever crashing, causing any accident. And if we drive next to a cliff, we know that if we turn the wheel to the right, the car is gonna run off the cliff and nothing good is gonna come out of this. Because we have a pretty good model of intuitive physics that tells us the car is gonna fall. We know about gravity. Babies learn this around the age of eight or nine months, that objects don't float, they fall. And we have a pretty good idea of the effect of turning the wheel on the car. And we know we need to stay on the road. So there's a lot of things that we bring to the table, which is basically our predictive model of the world. And that model allows us to not do stupid things and to basically stay within the context of things we need to do. We still face unpredictable situations and that's how we learn. But that allows us to learn really, really, really quickly. So that's called model-based reinforcement learning. There's some imitation and supervised learning because we have a driving instructor that tells us occasionally what to do. But most of the learning is model-based. is learning the model, learning physics that we've done since we were babies. That's where almost all the learning And the physics is somewhat transferable from, is transferable from scene to scene. Stupid things are the same everywhere. Yeah. I mean, if you have experience of the world, you don't need to be a particularly, from a particularly intelligent species to know that if you spill water from a container, the rest is gonna get wet. You might get wet. So, cats know this, right? Yeah. So the main problem we need to solve is how do we learn models of the world? That's what I'm interested in. That's what self supervised learning is all about. If you were to try to construct a benchmark for, let's look at MNIST. I love that data set. If you, do you think it's useful, interesting, slash possible to perform well on MNIST with just one example of each digit? And how would we solve that problem? The answer is probably yes. The question is what other type of learning are you allowed to do? So if what you're allowed to do is train on some gigantic data set of labeled digit, that's called transfer learning. And we know that works, okay? We do this at Facebook, like in production, right? We train large convolutionists to predict hashtags that people type on Instagram and we train on billions of images, literally billions. And then we chop off the last layer and fine tune on whatever task we want. That works really well. You can beat the ImageNet record with this. We actually open sourced the whole thing like a few weeks ago. Yeah, that's still pretty cool. But yeah, so what would be impressive? What's useful and impressive? What kind of transfer learning would be useful and impressive? Is it Wikipedia, that kind of thing? No, no, so I don't think transfer learning is really where we should focus. We should try to do, have a kind of scenario for a benchmark where you have unlabeled data and it's very large number of unlabeled data. It could be video clips. It could be where you do frame prediction. It could be images where you could choose to mask a piece of it. Could be whatever, but they're unlabeled and you're not allowed to label them. So you do some training on this and then you train on a particular supervised task, ImageNet or NIST, and you measure how your test error or validation error decreases as you increase the number of labeled training samples. Okay, and what you'd like to see is that your error decreases much faster than if you train from scratch, from random weights. So that to reach the same level of performance and a completely supervised, purely supervised system would reach, you would need way fewer samples. So that's the crucial question, because it will answer the question to people interested in medical image analysis. Okay, if I want to get a particular level of error rate for this task, I know I need a million samples. Can I do self-supervised pre-training to reduce this to about 100 or something? And you think the answer there is self-supervised pre-training? Yeah, some form of it. Telling you active learning, but you disagree. No, it's not useless. It's just not gonna lead to a quantum leap. It's just gonna make things that we already do. So you're way smarter than me. I just disagree with you. But I don't have anything to back that. It's just intuition. So I worked with a lot of large scale data sets and there's something that might be magic in active learning. But okay, at least I said it publicly. At least I'm being an idiot publicly. Okay. It's not being an idiot, it's working with the data you have. I mean, certainly people are doing things like, okay, I have 3,000 hours of imitation learning for a self-driving car, but most of those are incredibly boring. What I like is select 10% of them that are kind of the most informative. And with just that, I would probably reach the same. So it's a weak form of active learning if you want. Yes, but there might be a much stronger version. Yeah, that's right. And that's an open question if it exists. The question is how much stronger can you get? Elon Musk is confident, talked to him recently. He's confident that large scale data and deep learning can solve the autonomous driving problem. What are your thoughts on the limits possibilities of deep learning in this space? It's obviously part of the solution. I mean, I don't think we'll ever have a self-driving system, or at least not in the foreseeable future, that does not use deep learning. Maybe put it this way. Now, how much of it? So in the history of sort of engineering, particularly sort of AI-like systems, there's generally a first phase where everything is built by hand, then there is a second phase, and that was the case for autonomous driving, 20, 30 years ago. There's a phase where there's a little bit of learning is used, but there's a lot of engineering that's involved in kind of taking care of corner cases and putting limits, et cetera, because the learning system is not perfect. And then as technology progresses, we end up relying more and more on learning. That's the history of character recognition, it's the history of speech recognition, now computer vision, natural language processing. And I think the same is going to happen with autonomous driving, that currently the methods that are closest to providing some level of autonomy, some decent level of autonomy, where you don't expect a driver to kind of do anything, is where you constrain the world. So you only run within 100 square kilometers or square miles in Phoenix, but the weather is nice and the roads are wide, which is what Waymo is doing. You completely over-engineer the car with tons of lidars and sophisticated sensors that are too expensive for consumer cars, but they're fine if you just run a fleet. And you engineer the hell out of everything else, you map the entire world, so you have complete 3D model of everything. So the only thing that the perception system has to take care of is moving objects and construction and sort of things that weren't in your map. And you can engineer a good SLAM system and all that stuff, right? So that's kind of the current approach that's closest to some level of autonomy, but I think eventually the long-term solution is gonna rely more and more on learning and possibly using a combination of self-supervised learning and model-based reinforcement or something like that. But ultimately learning will be not just at the core, but really the fundamental part of the system. Yeah, it already is, but it will become more and more. What do you think it takes to build a system with human level intelligence? You talked about the AI system in the movie, her being way out of reach, our current reach. This might be outdated as well, but- It's still way out of reach. It's still way out of reach. What would it take to build her, do you think? So I can tell you the first two obstacles that we have to clear, but I don't know how many obstacles there are after this. So the image I usually use is that there's a bunch of mountains that we have to climb and we can see the first one, but we don't know if there are 50 mountains behind it or not. And this might be a good sort of metaphor for why AI researchers in the past have been overly optimistic about the result of AI. For example, New Orleans Simon wrote the general problem solver and they call it the general problem solver. General problem solver. And of course, the first thing you realize is that all the problems you want to solve are exponential and so you can't actually use it for anything useful. But you know- Yeah, so yeah, all you see is the first peak. So what are the first couple of peaks for her? So the first peak, which is precisely what I'm working on, is self-supervised learning. How do we get machines to learn models of the world by observation, kind of like babies and like young animals? So we've been working with cognitive scientists. So this Emmanuelle Dupoux, who's at fair in Paris, is half time, he's also a researcher in French university. And he has this chart that shows how many months of life baby humans can learn different concepts. And you can measure this in various ways. So things like distinguishing animate objects from inanimate objects, you can tell the difference at age two, three months. Whether an object is gonna stay stable, is gonna fall, you know, about four months, you can tell. You know, there are various things like this. And then things like gravity, the fact that objects are not supposed to float in the air but are supposed to fall, you learn this around the age of eight or nine months. If you look at a lot of eight-month-old babies, you give them a bunch of toys on their high chair, first thing they do is they throw them on the ground and they look at them. It's because, you know, they're learning about, actively learning about gravity. Gravity, yeah. So they're not trying to annoy you, but they need to do the experiment, right? So, you know, how do we get machines to learn like babies? Mostly by observation with a little bit of interaction and learning those models of the world, because I think that's really a crucial piece of an intelligent autonomous system. So if you think about the architecture of an intelligent autonomous system, it needs to have a predictive model of the world. So something that says, here is a world at time t, here is a state of the world at time t plus one if I take this action. And it's not a single answer, it can be a bunch of- Yeah, it can be a distribution, yeah. Yeah, well, but we don't know how to represent distributions in high dimensional continuous spaces. So it's gotta be something weaker than that, okay? But with some representation of uncertainty. If you have that, then you can do what optimal control theorists call model predictive control, which means that you can run your model with a hypothesis for a sequence of action and then see the result. Now, what you need, the other thing you need is some sort of objective that you want to optimize. Am I reaching the goal of grabbing this object? Am I minimizing energy? Am I whatever, right? So there is some sort of objective that you have to minimize. And so in your head, if you have this model, you can figure out the sequence of action that will optimize your objective. That objective is something that ultimately is rooted in your basal ganglia, at least in the human brain, that's what it's basal ganglia, computes your level of contentment or miscontentment. I don't know if that's a word. Unhappiness, okay? Yeah, discontentment. Discontentment, maybe. And so your entire behavior is driven towards kind of minimizing that objective, which is maximizing your contentment computed by your basal ganglia. And what you have is an objective function, which is basically a predictor of what your basal ganglia is gonna tell you. So you're not gonna put your hand on fire because you know it's gonna burn and you're gonna get hurt. And you're predicting this because of your model of the world and your sort of predictor of this objective, right? So if you have those three components, you have four components, you have the hardwired contentment objective computer, if you want, calculator. And then you have the three components. One is the objective predictor, which basically predicts your level of contentment. One is the model of the world. And there's a third module I didn't mention, which is a module that will figure out the best course of action to optimize an objective given your model. Okay? Yeah. Cool, it's a policy network or something like that, right? Now, you need those three components to act autonomously, intelligently, and you can be stupid in three different ways. You can be stupid because your model of the world is wrong. You can be stupid because your objective is not aligned with what you actually want to achieve. Okay? In humans, there would be a psychopath. And then the third way you can be stupid is that you have the right model, you have the right objective, but you're unable to figure out a course of action to optimize your objective given your model. Okay. Some people who are in charge of big countries actually have all three that are wrong. All right. Which countries? I don't know. Okay, so if we think about this agent, if you think about the movie Her, you've criticized the art project that is Sophia the Robot. And what that project essentially does is uses our natural inclination to anthropomorphize things that look like human and give them more. Do you think that could be used by AI systems, like in the movie Her? So do you think that body is needed to create a feeling of intelligence? Well, if Sophia was just an art piece, I would have no problem with it, but it's presented as something else. Let me add that comment real quick. If creators of Sophia could change something about their marketing or behavior in general, what would it be? What's... I'm just about everything. I mean, don't you think, here's a tough question. Let me, so I agree with you. So Sophia is not, the general public feels that Sophia can do way more than she actually can. That's right. And the people who created Sophia are not honestly, publicly communicating, trying to teach the public. But here's a tough question. Don't you think the same thing is scientists in industry and research are taking advantage of the same misunderstanding in the public when they create AI companies or publish stuff? Some companies, yes. I mean, there is no sense of, there's no desire to delude. There's no desire to kind of over claim what something is done. You publish a paper on AI that has this result on ImageNet. It's pretty clear. I mean, that's not even interesting anymore. But I don't think there is that... I mean, the reviewers are generally not very forgiving of unsupported claims of this type. And, but there are certainly quite a few startups that have had a huge amount of hype around this that I find extremely damaging and I've been calling it out when I've seen it. So yeah, but to go back to your original question, like the necessity of embodiment, I think, I don't think embodiment is necessary. I think grounding is necessary. So I don't think we're gonna get machines that really understand language without some level of grounding in the real world. And it's not clear to me that language is a high enough bandwidth medium to communicate how the real world works. I think for this- Can you talk to what grounding means to you? So grounding means that, so there is this classic problem of common sense reasoning, the Winograd schema, right? And so I tell you the trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it's too big, or the trophy doesn't fit in the suitcase because it's too small. And the it in the first case refers to the trophy in the second case to the suitcase. And the reason you can figure this out is because you know what the trophy and the suitcase are. One is supposed to fit in the other one and the notion of size and the big object doesn't fit in a small object unless it's a Tardis, things like that, right? So you have this knowledge of how the world works, of geometry and things like that. I don't believe you can learn everything about the world by just being told in language how the world works. I think you need some low level perception of the world, be it visual touch, whatever, but some higher bandwidth perception of the world. So by reading all the world's text, you still may not have enough information. That's right. There's a lot of things that just will never appear in text and that you can't really infer. So I think common sense will emerge from, certainly a lot of language interaction, but also with watching videos or perhaps even interacting in virtual environments and possibly robot interacting in the real world. But I don't actually believe necessarily that this last one is absolutely necessary, but I think there's a need for some grounding. But the final product doesn't necessarily need to be embodied, you're saying. No. It just needs to have an awareness, a grounding. Right, but it needs to know how the world works to not be frustrating to talk to. And you talked about emotions being important. That's a whole nother topic. Well, so I talked about the basal ganglia as the thing that calculates your level of miscontentment. And then there is this other module that sort of tries to do a prediction of whether you're gonna be content or not. That's the source of some emotion. So fear, for example, is an anticipation of bad things that can happen to you. You have this inkling that there is some chance that something really bad is gonna happen to you and that creates fear. Well, you know for sure that something bad is gonna happen to you, you kind of give up, right? It's not fear anymore. It's uncertainty that creates fear. So the punchline is, we're not gonna have autonomous intelligence without emotions. Okay. Whatever the heck emotions are. So you mentioned very practical things of fear, but there's a lot of other mess around it. But there are kind of the results of drives. Yeah, there's deeper biological stuff going on. And I've talked to a few folks on this. There's a lot of things that are going on. There's fascinating stuff that ultimately connects to our brain. If we create an AGI system, sorry. Human level intelligence. Human level intelligence system. And you get to ask her one question, what would that question be? You know, I think the first one we'll create will probably not be that smart. They'd be like a four year old. Okay. So you would have to ask her a question to know she's not that smart. Yeah. Well, what's a good question to ask, you know, to be impressive. What is the cause of wind? And if she answers, oh, it's because the leaves of the tree are moving and that creates wind. She's onto something. And if she says, that's a stupid question, she's really onto something. No, and then you tell her actually, you know, here is the real thing. And she says, oh yeah, that makes sense. So questions that reveal the ability to do common sense reasoning about the physical world. Yeah. And you'll sum it up with a causal inference. Causal inference. Well, it was a huge honor. Congratulations on the Turing Award. Thank you so much for talking today. Thank you. Appreciate it.","completion":"spoken"}
{"prompt":"On behalf of the Government and the people of Nigeria, I would like to congratulate the President and his country on his election to preside over the General Assembly at its seventieth session. May I also express appreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, and to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, both of whom worked tirelessly to ensure the proper articulation of the post-2015 development agenda and to maintain the focus and commitment to the ideals of the United Nations. I also thank the Secretary-General for his recent visit to Nigeria, where we held very useful discussions.\nFifty-five years ago, almost to the day, my predecessor, Nigeria\u2019s first Prime Minister, Alhaji Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, stood in this forum to declare Nigeria\u2019s desire to develop and maintain friendly relations with all countries. He also assured the world of our country\u2019s commitment to upholding the principles upon which the United Nations was founded.\nMy country has lived by that conviction, even when, for instance, judgements went against us in territorial disputes with our neighbours. We respected those judgements and abided by them as a mark of respect for the rule of law and the Charter of the United Nations. Nigeria\u2019s record in the service of United Nations peacekeeping operations is second to none. I myself, as a young officer in the Nigerian army, did several tours of duty in the Congo and Lebanon. Nigeria has contributed to United Nations peacekeeping efforts in Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Darfur. Furthermore, we are proud of our contributions to other activities of the United Nations, including the Peacebuilding Commission, the Human Rights Council and security-sector reform.\nWe are gratified to note that most countries have pledged their commitment to the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70\/1) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contained therein, along with their means of implementation. That successor framework to the Millennium Development Goals has come with lofty aspirations and, if I may say so, heroic assumptions. Nonetheless, the new Goals target broad- ranging development cooperation by the international community up to the year 2030, and they deserve universal support. That is because the SDGs mirror the hopes and aspirations of much of the world.\nI should stress that for the newly adopted SDGs to be truly global, they must be practical. In that regard, the Agenda\u2019s core objectives of eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities must be met within the framework of revitalized global partnership support and concrete policies and actions, as outlined in the Addis Ababa Agenda on Financing for Development. Luckily, those two core objectives of the SDGs are precisely at the centre of the agenda of Nigeria\u2019s new Administration.\nIt must be emphasized that foreign direct investment, supplemented, where suitable, by official development assistance, as outlined in the Addis Ababa Agenda, are necessary, though not sufficient, conditions for accelerated development in countries that are trying to catch up. In that connection, I would like to appeal to industrialized countries to redeem their pledges to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to development assistance. With the sole exception of the United Kingdom, all the countries concerned, so I am told, have still to meet that United Nations requirement. With the SDGs, we have the opportunity to improve the lives of people, not just in the developing world but in all nations.\nThe Secretary-General himself has listed six essential elements for delivering on the SDGs, namely, dignity, prosperity, justice, partnership, planet and people. As a prerequisite to those elements, and as we look at history and remember the terrible events that gave rise to the birth of the United Nations in 1945, I would like to propose a seventh essential element, namely, peace.\nPeace is close to the hearts of Nigerians, as we are in the front line in the war on terror. Boko Haram\u2019s war against the people of Nigeria, Chad, the Niger and\nCameroon may not attract as much worldwide attention as the wars in the Middle East, but the suffering is just as great and the human cost is equally high. This is a war about values between progress and chaos. It concerns democracy and the rule of law. Boko Haram celebrates violence against the weak and the innocent and, deplorably, hides behind its perverted interpretation of Islam. Boko Haram is as far from Islam as can possibly be imagined.\nMany of my colleagues present in this forum want to know how our new Government intends to tackle the huge problems that we have inherited. Friends of Nigeria and foreign investor partners will be encouraged to know that the new Government is attacking the problems we inherited head-on. We intend to tackle the inequalities arising from massive unemployment and the previous Government\u2019s policies that favoured a few people to the detriment of the many. We intend to emphasize quality technological education for development and lay a foundation for the comprehensive care of the aged, the disadvantaged and the infirm. But for now, terrorism is the immediate problem.\nAccordingly, the new Nigerian Government, which I have the honour to head, has moved with dispatch to implement a bold and robust strategy to defeat Boko Haram. Nigeria and its neighbours \u2014 Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and Benin \u2014 are working together to face the common threat within the regional framework of the Lake Chad Basin Commission. We have established a multinational joint task force to confront, degrade and defeat Boko Haram. We have driven them away from many of their strongholds, killed or captured many of their operatives and commanders and freed several hundreds of hostages. One of our major aims is to rescue the Chibok girls alive and unharmed. We are working around the clock to ensure their safety and eventual reunion with their families. The Chibok girls are constantly on our minds and in our plans.\nTerrorism is by no means the main or the only evil threatening and undermining the well-being of societies around the world. Corruption, cross-border financial crime, cybercrime, human trafficking, communicable diseases, climate change and the proliferation of weapons are all major challenges of the twenty-first century that the international community must tackle collectively. I would like to reaffirm the Nigerian Government\u2019s unwavering commitment to fighting corruption and illicit financial flows. By any measure, corruption and cross-border financial crimes\nare impediments to development, economic growth and the realization of the well-being of citizens across the globe.\nNigeria is ready and willing to partner with international agencies and individual countries on a bilateral basis to confront crime and corruption. In particular, I call upon the international community to urgently redouble its efforts to strengthen the mechanisms for dismantling safe havens for the proceeds of corruption and for ensuring the return of stolen funds and assets to their countries of origin.\nThe world is now facing another big new challenge, that is, human trafficking. It is an old evil that has taken on an altogether new and dangerous dimension, which threatens to upset international relationships. We in Africa are grieved to see in the international media the hundreds of thousands of our able-bodied men and women who are fleeing to Europe, with thousands dying in the process in the desert or drowning in the Mediterranean. We condemn in the strongest possible terms traffickers in human beings and will support any measures to apprehend and bring them to justice. At the same time, we greatly appreciate European Governments, particularly those of Italy and Germany, for their understanding and humane treatment of those refugees.\nLast year, our continent faced the dreadful outbreak of Ebola. We sincerely thank the international community for its collective efforts to contain that deadly disease. We are not out of the woods yet, but we would like to express our appreciation to the United States, the United Kingdom, France and China, which, in collaboration with the host countries, provided outstanding assistance to stop the spread of Ebola and to care for those infected.\nNigeria fully subscribes to and endorses Goals 13, 14 and 15 of the Sustainable Development Goals with regard to climate change. In Nigeria, desertification and land erosion and degradation, which lead to biodiversity loss, are real threats to our environment and, under the auspices of the Lake Chad Basin Commission, we will propose a regional approach to combating those environmental challenges. In that connection, we look forward to the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December. That Summit should give humankind hope\nthat the looming threat faced by many communities around the world is being addressed.\nWe are witnessing a dreadful increase in conflicts fuelled by the availability of small arms and light weapons. I call upon all Member States to show the political will needed to uphold the Charter of the United Nations in that regard. For a start, robust implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty will guarantee that small arms and light weapons are transferred only in a legal manner. Arms traffickers and human traffickers are two evil species that the international community needs to eradicate.\nAs we engage in these annual debates, we must remind ourselves of the principles that led to the founding of the United Nations years ago. Among them are the peaceful coexistence and self-determination of peoples. In that context, the unresolved question of self-determination for the peoples of Palestine and Western Sahara, both nations having been adjudged by the United Nations as being entitled to that inalienable right, must now be resolved without any further delay or obstacle.\nThe international community has come to pin its hopes on resolving the Palestinian issue through the two-State solution, which recognizes the legitimate right of each State to exist in peace and security. The world has no more excuses or reasons to delay the implementation of the long list of Security Council resolutions on that question, nor do we have the moral right to deny any people their freedom or condemn them indefinitely to occupation and blockade.\nThe United Nations is 70 years old.

{"prompt":"\ufeffAllow me to convey the congratulations of the\nGovernment and the people of Bolivia to you,\nMr. President. Your well-deserved election is fitting\nrecognition of your work and prestige.\nAllow me also to commend the work of Ambassador\nRazali Ismail of Malaysia, who so ably conducted the\ndeliberations of the previous session of the General\nAssembly.\nFinally, my congratulations go as well to Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan, whose contributions to the cause of\nworld peace and cooperation have earned him the\nunanimous gratitude of the Member States of this\nOrganization.\nAll the countries of Latin America, in one way or\nanother and each at its own pace, have put long decades\nof ideological confrontation and economic crisis behind\nthem. They have opened their markets, controlled\ninflation, reduced the deficit and privatized public\nenterprises. They have rebuilt their democratic\ninstitutional structures on new foundations, with new\nprotagonists, and restarted the process of growth.\nHowever, old structural adjustment problems,\naggravated by the period of crisis, have surfaced. Clearly\nthe most important of these is the inequitable distribution\nof income and its results: exclusion, poverty, violence and\nsocial fragmentation. Such inequities have created ever-\ngreater gaps between the immensely rich and those who\nhave barely enough to survive. There are no social\nsecurity systems to protect the dispossessed, to cushion\ntheir fall and rehabilitate them so that they can live a\nproductive life. For this reason, the potential for violence\nand discontent on our continent is growing larger and\nmore dangerous.\nThese factors aside, however, Latin America meets\nall of the necessary conditions to forge ahead and grow in\nthat it has the capacity and courage to continue to\nchange \u2014 to increase society\u2019s store of knowledge, create\nnew competitive advantages, eliminate internal\nmarginalization, reduce extreme poverty, rebuild the State,\n\n\nand speak with its own voice in the world political\ncommunity.\nEducation stands out as a vital precondition for all of\nthese goals. Without a far-reaching revolution in the area of\neducation, we will not be able to achieve these goals or\nmeet the challenges of our time.\nToday, Latin America is no longer asking others for\nwhat it cannot do on its own. Proof of this is the significant\nprogress recently made in strengthening mechanisms for\neconomic integration, such as the Andean Group and the\nSouthern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR). The\nregion is also taking a different approach in its relations\nwith the economically advanced countries. The old\ndefensive and mistrustful attitude has yielded to the\nconviction that it is necessary to merge Latin America\u2019s\neconomy into the contemporary current of productive and\ntechnological development, attract investments and open its\nmarkets to its products while preserving its identity,\nupholding its values and attending to its interests, without\nfor an instant losing sight of the fact that the key to its\nstrength lies in its own markets and in its resources.\nLet me reiterate Bolivia\u2019s concern about landmines. It\nis incomprehensible that those very same borders across\nwhich we are seeking to promote trade and integration\nshould be sown with devices of war that endanger the\ncivilian population and threaten their fundamental rights.\nWe are convinced that the Governments of the region\ndirectly affected by the problem will find a way to resolve\nit.\nThis matter is of particular and direct relevance to\nBolivia, due to the well-known and acknowledged fact that\nChile has laid a significant number of mines along our\ncommon border. Removal of those mines is of the utmost\nurgency, in keeping with the commitments entered into in\nOslo, the dictates of morality and the imperative of the\nspirit of integration that should prevail between\nneighbouring nations. Avoidance of this topic is not the\nattitude that the international community wishes to see.\nWhat is needed is firm resolve and the sincere will to\ncontribute to peace between countries that must impart a\nsense of solidarity to their borders.\nSince the early days of its independence, Bolivia has\nrejected the use of force and the arms race as an instrument\nof its foreign policy. We have the moral authority,\ntherefore, to condemn those commercial interests that seek\nto foster the procurement of war mat\u00e9riel, thereby\ncompromising what we have achieved so far in terms of\npreserving peace on the continent.\nI have sought to describe the process of change in\nLatin America in order to show the extent to which\ndevelopments in each of our countries are part of a\nbroader and more comprehensive historical trend.\nHowever, Bolivia\u2019s transformation has its own particular\nfeatures. Following a lengthy process of social\nconfrontation, we have restored democracy and economic\nfreedoms in Bolivia. In a spirit of respect for human\nrights and freedoms, we have given full support to the\npolitical system and fuelled the economic growth and\ndevelopment that prevail today in Bolivia. It should be\nunderscored that this was a peaceful reconstruction\nprocess \u2014 the result of democratic dialogue.\nMy Government, the product of a mandate of the\npeople, represents more than 70 per cent of the Bolivian\nelectorate. Nonetheless, we must continue to move\nforward and broaden the scope of dialogue and consensus,\ninvolving social institutions and their leaders in the task\nof identifying the main objectives of development in\nBolivia as well as the broad outlines of our strategy for\nthe twenty-first century. That is the purpose of the\nnational dialogue that I have recently called for, which\nhas the support of all the political parties \u2014 Government\nand opposition; the church; private enterprise; and farmers\nand workers.\nOf course, this new country we are building is\nlooking to the future from a different perspective and with\na sense of renewed confidence. The time has come to\nreaffirm Bolivia\u2019s role on our continent \u2014 its role as a\ncrossroads and as a land of contacts, at the juncture of the\ngreat basins and the great cultures of America. Bolivia\u2019s\nkey geographical position may become one of its major\ncomparative advantages and an essential element in\nenhancing the country\u2019s international stature.\nHowever, this is not yet a reality. It is a task that\nremains to be accomplished, a promise that remains to be\nfulfilled. To this end, Bolivia will need to rebuild its\nmaritime capacity; reduce the transportation cost of its\nproducts; and create a modern export sector and connect\nit with the Pacific and the Atlantic. We must see and\nunderstand our country as a part of the continent.\nBolivia\u2019s association with MERCOSUR is not only\nthe result of a desire to cultivate a historical friendship\nbut also a consequence of the concrete needs of Bolivian\ndevelopment. The exceptional growth in the eastern areas\n2\n\n\nof Bolivia calls for a more intense and productive\nrelationship with our neighbours on the Atlantic.\nThat effort coincides with one of the most impressive\ndevelopment ventures in the history of America, which is\ntaking place now on the territories of Brazil, Bolivia,\nParaguay, Argentina and Uruguay. Investments and\ntechnology must be allowed to flow freely in that region.\nWe must set up a genuine common market, a multinational\ndevelopment project, around this potential, which should\nalso promote the integration of our countries into the world\neconomy. It is well known that the Paraguay-Paran\u00e1\nwaterway is the natural route linking the area.\nThat major project, however, has already gone beyond\nthe imagination of the visionaries and the negotiating tables\nof the diplomats. It is now in the hands of engineers and\nworkers. After more than 30 years of efforts, construction\nhas begun on the Santa Cruz-San Pablo-Curitiba gas\npipeline, the first segment of a network of energy\ndistribution for which Bolivia\u2019s territory provides the\ncrossroads. This is one of the largest engineering projects\nin the history of the region. It will stretch for more than\n3,000 kilometres, will carry more than 7 billion cubic feet\nof natural gas over 20 years and will require a total\ninvestment of nearly $5 billion.\nBolivia\u2019s very existence is directly tied to the Pacific.\nAccordingly, we have been following with great interest the\nprocess of consolidating the vast potential of the Andean\ncommunity. That potential is also found in our immediate\nvicinity. The economies of Bolivia, Peru and Chile are\ncomplementary.\nOur territories are not only markets, but avenues for\nintegration. The territories of Peru and Chile hold Bolivia\u2019s\ngateway to the Pacific, while that of Bolivia opens up\ncommunication between those nations and the vast interior\nof the continent.\nI must stress, however, that the reality still falls far\nshort of the potential. The reason for this is to be found in\na war that took place just over 100 years ago, and whose\nadverse consequences continue to be felt in the relations\nbetween our countries. Undoubtedly, the most unjust and\nserious of those consequences is the geographical enclosure\nimposed upon Bolivia.\nBolivia\u2019s demand to return to the Pacific Ocean, with\nsovereign rights and a coastline of its own cannot be\nrenounced. It is a vital condition for our national\ndevelopment but, above all, a historical claim that cannot be\ncompromised. The recovery of our maritime access,\ntemporarily lost, is an essential condition for fulfilling our\ncontinental role as a crossroads and a point of\nconvergence. My country will turn to the international\ncommunity as many times as necessary in order to call\nattention to a problem that has already been deemed a\nmatter of permanent hemispheric interest in the light of its\nmany implications for continental security and harmony.\nDespite everything, my Government, as always, remains\nready to explore avenues of constructive dialogue with an\nopen mind.\nIllicit drug trafficking unjustly distorts the reality of\nBolivia and affects and interferes with the proper conduct\nof external cooperation. Bolivia itself has done a great\ndeal to contain this problem. It has not permitted drug\ntrafficking to taint beyond repair its economic,\ninstitutional and political structure. And it has done so\npeacefully, without resorting to violence. Nevertheless, the\nstigma of drug trafficking exists, and while we are\ndisturbed by the manner in which it is magnified, it would\nbe a mistake to ignore it.\nAccordingly, my Government has taken the decision\nto remove Bolivia from the drug-trafficking circuit within\nthe term of my administration. We shall use dialogue and\nconsultation with peasant producers of coca in order\ndefinitively to eradicate illegal crops. We shall be ruthless\nwith the drug traffickers. We shall not give them a\nmoment\u2019s rest until they have been for ever banned from\nthe history of Bolivia.\nNaturally, this is not an exclusively Bolivian\nproblem, nor can our actions alone resolve the global and\nhemispheric problem of illegal trafficking in narcotics. It\nis a matter that concerns all and that requires everyone\u2019s\ncommitment. Therefore, the time has come to reaffirm the\nprinciples of shared responsibility. The characteristics and\nscope of this problem mean that it cannot be faced\neffectively through isolated efforts. It undeniably calls for\nresolute action by all countries, especially those affected\nby consumption and who have sufficient economic\nresources to combat this terrible evil.\nMy country reaffirms its commitment to the peace\nprocess in the Middle East in keeping with the principles\nand values that guide harmonious coexistence between\npeoples. However, given the resurgence of tensions and\nnew acts of confrontation, we call upon the parties not to\ngo back on the commitments already made. That is the\nfirm answer for maintaining peace in the region.\n3\n\n\nIn another vein, Bolivia has received with satisfaction\nthe Secretary-General\u2019s initiative proposing a broad\nprogramme of reforms in the United Nations system. We\nfeel it is essential to strengthen the role of the Secretariat.\nWe reiterate the importance of the process of expansion and\nreform of the Security Council with a view to correcting\npresent imbalances, guaranteeing equitable and non-\ndiscriminatory geographical distribution, improving its\ndecision-making mechanisms and making it an organ that\ncan take action in a manner that is increasingly legitimate\nand representative of the countries that make up the United\nNations. Bolivia shares the view that we should move\ntowards the elimination of the veto, limiting its use in the\ninterim to issues considered under Chapter VII of the\nCharter.\nBolivia reiterates its commitment to the principles that\nhave guided global solidarity for more than 50 years. We\nBolivians believe that there can be no relinquishing of the\nstandards that establish mutual respect and the sovereign\nequality of States, regardless of their size or level of\ndevelopment. Nor can we surrender the principles of\npeaceful settlement of disputes, the inviolability and\nintegrity of territories and respect for self-determination of\npeoples that wish to preserve their own systems of life and\nGovernment, free from threats.\nIf there is a lesson to be learned from the experience\nof the century now drawing to a close, it is the versatility\nof the human endeavour. Mankind has an incorrigible\ntendency to make mistakes, but also a talent for correcting\nthem and for building from the rubble the new portals of\nfreedom and faith.\nWith the approach of the new millennium, at an hour\nthat is both dusk and dawn, we must look upon the events\nof the world from the dual perspective of humility and\nhope.\n\n\n\n\n\n","completion":"spoken"}

{"prompt":"POTENTIAL OF GEOLOCATED CROWDSOURCED IMAGE POSTS IN PREDICTING AN EARLY ESTIMATE OF THE PATTERNS OF STRUCTURAL DAMAGE FOLLOWING A HURRICANE\n\nDuring a disaster, the activity of the crowd represents a very valuable source of the on-the-ground conditions shared by the affected citizens.

The results shown the spatial relationship between the crowdsourced photos and different damage types. Furthermore, potential of crowdsourced images for improving the awareness of the structural damage after the hurricane have been discussed. * Corresponding author\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMobile technologies, web-based platforms, and social media have made it possible to easily exchange information related to any topic, including natural and human driven disasters. Focusing on disasters, Poblet et al. (2018), have shown that this type of sources has changed the landscape of disaster management. Damage assessment upon a disaster event, such as a hurricane, has a very important role since it helps to understand the nature and size of the event on which the further emergency response and recovery activities depend. The term crowdsourcing was introduced by Jeff Howe (2008) who defined it as \"the act of taking a job traditionally performed by a designated agent and outsourcing it to an undefined, generally large group of people in the form of an open call\". Combining mobile technology and crowdsourcing methods new forms of contribution to the disaster management have been created. According to the research of Roberts and Doyle (2017), during a disaster, the crowd engagement is constantly growing. It could represent a very valuable source of the on-the-ground conditions shared by the affected citizens. If this type of source is considered as real-time crowdsourcing of crisis information, the spatial distribution of geolocated images related to an event could represent an early indicator of the severity of its impact (Spasenovic et al., 2019). In the light of previous consideration, the following question may arise: would it be possible to estimate the building damage distribution by exploiting crowdsourced information?\nOver the past years, the increase of research work focused on crowdsourced information related to a disaster has been recorded in literature. Corbane et al. (2012) have explored the relationship between the spatial pattern of SMS messages and building damage in the Haiti disaster of 2010. Triglav-Cekada and Radovan (2013) have explored the potential of crowdsourced information for mapping the flood that happened in Slovenia in November 2012. Albuquerque et al. (2014) have compared the spatial distribution of social media with respect to authoritative data in order to identify useful information for disaster management.\nThe work presented in this paper explores the spatial relationship between two datasets that describe the damage of the buildings after the hurricane. Crowdsourced image posts were compared with the building damage map to understand the potential of modelling the spatial distribution of damaged buildings based on geolocated images. The case study event is hurricane Michael that hit the Florida Coast of the United States of America in the period from 7 th October to 11 th October of 2018. According to the report from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Beven et al. 2019) Panama City was one of the most affected areas. The available crowdsourced images describe the damage of the buildings in Panama City. The dataset was provided by National Alliance for Public Safety GIS (NAPSG) Foundation and it is publicly accessible. NAPSG foundation with the help of GISCorps volunteers have collected one hundred and nine crowdsourced photos relevant to the hurricane impact over the area of interest. On the other hand, the building damage dataset has been created by Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), based on the analysis of high-resolution post-event imagery performed by professional mappers. Exploring the two available independent point datasets, the spatial pattern of each individual dataset has been analysed and furthermore the spatial relationship between them has been explored. A set of spatial statistics have been computed with R software. For this purpose, the distance-based methods have been used, that consider the mutual position of points to describe the patterns. More precisely, the positional relationship between the crowdsourced images and affected buildings have been recorded. The results are presented and discussed, showing the potential of crowdsourced images for improving the awareness of the structural damage after the hurricane.\nThe NAPSG Foundation, with the help of twenty GISCorps volunteers, in four days collected nearly 600 geolocated photos relevant to the hurricane. The photos were located over the areas hit by the hurricane, showing its impact on the structures, nature, and community.\nFor the purpose of this research photos describing the building damage over Panama City have been selected from the original dataset. Totally, one hundred and nine crowdsourced photos showing the damaged buildings of Panama City have been selected. The selected photos have been grouped into two categories: the first group of 104 photos (95.5%) presents affected buildings and the second group of 5 photos (4.5%) presents collapsed buildings. Three days after the hurricane Michael landfall, the first images were collected on the platform. The total dataset has been ready in seven days, the exact day of the platform activation is not known. As it can be seen in Figure 1, the highest number of photos, representing building damage in Panama City, was collected over a period of two days, the most productive was the fifth day with totally 67 photos (62%). The images were collected from social media and news outlets. The georeferencing of the image posts was done by volunteers, that found a clue objects in the pictures, useful for location definition. This is very important fact that allows to make the hypothesis that the defined location of the collected image posts has high precision. It is useful to point out that all GISCorps volunteers have knowledge of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), according to which the tasks were assigned. Thanks to this, it is possible to confirm the reliability of the provided data.\n\nBuilding damage assessment\nFEMA Mapping and Analysis Centre (MAC) created an open access repository: the Historical Damage Assessment Database (source: http:\/\/disasters.geoplatform.gov\/publicdata\/ National\/Data\/HistoricalDamageAssessmentDatabase\/), that contains geospatial damage assessments from the past national disaster events in the United States. For this research, a point dataset showing the buildings of Panama City that were damaged by hurricane Michael was downloaded from the repository. The buildings damage assessment was based on the analysis of high-resolution post-event imagery performed by professional mappers. Two damage categories were present in the dataset: Affected and Destroyed. \"Affected\" label corresponds to buildings which in the post-event imagery were missing roof segments, presented failure of structural elements and\/or had visible damage. \"Destroyed\" label corresponds to buildings which collapsed. It is important to point out that visual imagery assessment was done using nadir imagery so damages to the sides of buildings were not evaluated. In order to have a more complete building dataset, which includes also not damaged buildings, Open Street Map (OSM) buildings of Panama City and surrounding area have been exported and compared with the FEMA dataset. In the OSM dataset, buildings are mapped as polygons, in order to have the data of the same type, the centroid of each OSM building polygon has been considered. Buildings coming from OSM that have not been mapped in the FEMA dataset have been marked as \"Not Affected\" and added to the damage assessment point dataset. All in all, the dataset contained 38.594 points ( Figure 2) of which 25.293 (65.5%) were labelled as \"not affected\" buildings, 13.044 (33.8%) as \"affected\" buildings and 267 (0.7%) as \"destroyed\" buildings.\n\nQuantitative analysis: kernel density estimator\nAn important descriptor for the purpose of this research is data distribution. Density estimates are ideal for this purpose, for the simple reason that they are easily understandable quantitative analysis. The kernel density estimator was proposed by (Silverman, 1986) for the estimation of the probability density function of a uni-variate random variable of which a sample of n observations is known. In the uni-dimensional case, given the sample of n observations X1\u2026Xn the Kernel density estimator is defined as: ( 1) where h = bin width, also called bandwidth x = origin K = symmetric probability density function which satisfies the condition (Silverman, 1986): (2) It is possible to implement algorithms that extend the kernel density estimation to two-dimensional variables, producing \"heatmaps\" that can be used to represent the results of the kernel density estimates.\nKernel density heatmaps can help to better understand the data and decide the direction of further analysis. For this reason, they are appropriate for the comparison of building damages types and suitable crowdsourced photos.\n\nResults of kernel density\nThe kernel density has been calculated to compare the spatial distribution between the two a priori different datasets. In fact, even though the datasets are different, they are both presenting the building damage types. Two categories of crowdsourced photos have been analysed separately and compared with heatmaps of corresponding building damage type. The heatmap of crowdsourced images, representing the affected buildings, was compared with the heatmap of the affected building mapped by FEMA (Figure 3). The heatmap of crowdsourced images representing the destroyed buildings was compared with the heatmap of the destroyed buildings ( Figure 4). As presented in Section 2, the size of the two datasets is very different. For ease of comparison, the same bandwidth was selected for the compared datasets. The bandwidth of 1 km was selected, according to the methodology of Sheather and Jones (1991). All analyses were performed in R software using the stats package (R Core Team, 2020). shows the kernel density of affected buildings mapped by FEMA. Observing the heatmap it is possible to see that affected buildings were registered in almost all parts of Panama City, especially in the south and south-east. The density of crowdsourced images of affected buildings (Figure 3b) shows that the images were taken in the same parts of the city where the affected buildings were registered. With this observation it is possible to say that the distribution of crowdsourced photos of affected buildings closely resembles the distribution of affected buildings. Moreover, the significant density of 1.2 10 -6 was registered for collected images in the southern part of the city. In the south-east part slightly lower density was registered, showing the presence of the collected photos in this area. Registered photos had smaller concentration than the ones in the southern parts of the observed area.  Figure 4a shows the kernel density of destroyed buildings mapped by FEMA. From the heatmap it is possible to see that a significant concentration of damaged buildings was recorded in the south-east part of the city. The kernel density map of crowdsourced images of destroyed buildings (Figure 4b) shows different results. The crowdsourced images of destroyed buildings were taken in the south-west parts of the city. For the selected radius of 1 km it is possible to see that the maximum density is 1.2 10 -07 , meaning that few points are present. In the south-west part of the city FEMA mapped destroyed buildings but with a low density (light blue spots in Figure 4a). The collected images of the destroyed buildings will not be further analysed, since they are not located in the most affected area and their number is low.\n\nSpatial pattern analysis\nTo better understand the pattern of the spatial distribution of the point datest, the distance-based method, Ripley's K-function, has been applied. The main characteristic of the distance-based methods, in general, is the consideration of the points spacing for pattern description (Moller and Waagepetersen, 2007). Spatial pattern analysis based on Ripley's K-function is a second-order analysis of point patterns in a two-dimensional space (Ripley, 1976). A point process can be considered as a a) The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLIII-B4-2020, 2020 XXIV ISPRS Congress (2020 edition) probabilistic model of phenomena or objects representable as a finite set of points in an observation window W (Diggle, 1986). Ripley's K function can be calculated in a univariate form, taking into consideration points of the same type. Given the location of all points from the same type within the study area, the Ripley's self-K function (Ripley, 1976) is calculated: ( where r = radius \u03bb = density (number per unit area) of events E = expected number of events within the radius r from a randomly chosen event.\nThe idea of the self-K function is to estimate the number of other points lying within the distance r of a randomly chosen point of the same event. In general, to evaluate the clustering or dispersion of the point pattern the Ripley's K(r) function should be tested to complete spatial randomness (CSR) (Ripley, 1979). This can be done by comparing the observed values to homogeneous Poisson process, where the theoretical values are distributed independently without any interaction. In practice it is considered to use the Besag L-function, transformation of the K-function (Besag and Clifford, 1989) because its variance is approximately constant under CSR (Ripley, 1979): Ripley's K-function and L-function have been widely used for defining and understanding the relationship between point pattern for data of the same type. They are hence suitable for exploring the relationship of crowdsourced photos and each type of building damage.\n\nResults of the self-correlations for damaged buildings and crowdsourced photos\nIn order to understand the spatial distribution of crowdsourced images and buildings with different type of damage grade the self-function Lii(r) has been applied. Each point type of the datasets has been individually observed: crowdsourced images, not affected buildings, affected buildings and destroyed buildings. All analyses were performed in R software using the spatstat package (Baddley and Turner, 2005;Baddley, 2008).  (Figure 5d), under the hypothesis of CSR. The study area was defined with the observation window representing the city of Panama City boundary map. To determine the statistical significance of the results the Monte Carlo method was applied and corresponding confidence intervals were obtained. In the context of spatial pattern analysis, the Monte Carlo method simulates randomly generated distribution of the same dimensions as the observed point pattern (Haase, 1995). The number of simulations was set to 99 which computed the 99% confidence envelope (Leemans, 1991).\n\nObserved value Theoretical value Confidence interval\nFigure 5. Self-function Lii for a) not affected buildings, aa) zoom on the distribution for small distances <20m, b) affected buildings, bb) zoom on the distribution for small distances <40m, c) destroyed buildings, d) crowdsourced images The deviations of the sample statistic from zero expectation (red line) is positive and above the upper limit of the confidence interval (upper green line) for all three types of building damage grades and crowdsourced images. The magnitudes of deviations from CSR are high, so it is possible to say that at both smalldistances and large-distances the distributions are clustered for crowdsourced photos as well as for all levels of building damage. According to the obtained results, as expected, the correlation is higher for the building damage of a same grade at small distances. The same can be said for crowdsourced images that have been taken from neighbouring locations. Taking a closer look at Figure 5a and b, Figure 5aa and bb show that the deviation trend for very small distances is under the zero expectation or inside the confidence interval. Therefore, it is possible to say that for very small distances (in particular less than 7m for not affected buildings and less than 15m for affected buildings) the spatial distribution can be considered random. The reason for that could be explained with the fact that points correspond to the centroids of buildings and in most cases buildings are surrounded by a garden. The nugget effect that is present in Figure 5d is caused by the spatial pattern of crowdsourced images, since more than one point shares the same location. This is very useful information related to the quality of the data collected from crowdsource platform. Checking the images with the same location, it has been found that two out of twelve pictures have been taken from the same location with different directions, while the remaining ten images are showing the damage of the same object (hospital and school) but from different angles (different locations). aa) The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences, Volume XLIII-B4-2020, 2020 XXIV ISPRS Congress (2020 edition)\n\nSpatial correlation of crowdsourced photos and building damage map\nThe K-function can be used not only to summarize the point pattern (as presented in Section 3.3), but also to explore the relationship between points of different type. The previous analyses considered only the location of points, they ignored any other information. The point patterns could have additional information about each point. For example, the points of a pattern could represent different types of objects (in our case points represent crowdsourced posts and damaged buildings). In addition, each point u of a point process X, could be associated to a random variable mu, called a mark. These data are called multivariate spatial point patterns (Stoyan and Stoyan, 1996). In this case the generalization of K(r) to more than one type of points is called cross-K function and is computed as follows: where r = circle radius \u03bb = density (number per unit area) of events i \u2260 j = types of the events E = expected number of events within the r of randomly chosen event. The idea of the cross-K function is to estimate the number of type j points within distance r of a randomly chosen type i point. The obtained value is compared with the theoretical one, which represents the absence of attractions or repulsion between data points of different types (Lotwick, 1984). For this purpose, the hypothesis of independence of population was used. As for the self-function (paragraph 3.3) it is also possible to define transformed cross-L function.\n\nResults of the cross-correlations\nThe cross-function Lij(r) has been applied in order to understand the spatial interaction between the two a priori different datasets of crowdsourced photos and building damage. Each building damage type has been considered separately and analysed with respect to crowdsourced images. In this way, it has been possible to study the type (namely, attraction or repulsion) of the different interactions and their intensity. It was possible to evaluate whether one type of point tends to be surrounded by points of the other type. Figure 6 shows the results of the computed cross-functions Lij describing the relationship of crowdsourced photos and not affected buildings (Figure 6a), of crowdsourced photos and affected buildings (Figure 6b), of crowdsourced photos and destroyed buildings (Figure 6c), under the hypothesis of independence of population (red line in the plots). To determine the statistical significance of the results, the Monte Carlo method was applied, and 99% confidence intervals were computed (green line in the plots).\n\nObserved value\nTheoretical value Confidence interval Figure 6. Cross-function Lij for a) crowdsourced images and not affected buildings, b) crowdsourced images and affected buildings, c) crowdsourced images and destroyed buildings The results show that cross-correlation between crowdsourced images and not affected buildings (Figure 6a) is positive and lies above the Monte-Carlo simulation envelope (99% confidence interval). The high magnitude from the upper boundary of the confidence interval indicates significant interactions between crowdsourced images and not affected buildings for all distance ranges. A bit different distribution of the cross-correlation between crowdsourced images and affected buildings has been recorded ( Figure 6b). The computed Lij is negative and inside the confidence interval for small distances (r < 500 m approximately), indicating not significant interactions. Furthermore, for the distances between 0.5 km and 4 km the distribution is positive and above the confidence interval, indicating the attraction between the crowdsourced images and affected buildings. This means that in a 0.5 to 4 km radius, the number of crowdsourced images surrounded by randomly chosen affected buildings is greater than expected if the two patterns are independent. For a distance of 4 km or more, repulsion between two observed objects has been found. Analysing the relationship between the crowdsourced photos and the destroyed buildings (Figure 6c), the distribution of the cross-correlation lies inside the envelope for distances smaller than 2 km and for distances larger than 7 km, suggesting not significant interactions between crowdsourced photos and destroyed buildings. For the remaining distances (2 km < r < 7 km approximately) the repulsion has been found.

The aim of this work is to explore spatial point processes in order to understand the possibility of crowdsourced data to predict an early estimate of the structural damage patterns following a hurricane. The first analysis used the kernel density function in order to build heatmaps. This fast and easy quantitative analysis highlighted the spots with a significant concentration of the observed point datasets. A simple visual inspection of the obtained results confirmed the concurrence between the distribution of crowdsourced photos of affected buildings and the distribution of affected buildings mapped by FEMA. On the contrary, the distribution of collected images of destroyed buildings was not matching with the distribution of mapped destroyed buildings and their total number was small. This observation led to the conclusion that crowdsourced photos of damaged buildings could not be considered as a representative sample. For this reason, they were excluded in further analyses.\nThe self-correlation analysis demonstrated the presence of clusters in the distribution patterns of different building damage types and crowdsourced images. These results indicated that building damages of the same type were registered close to each other. Similarly, crowdsourced photos were taken in neighbouring locations. The cross-correlation analysis highlights the spatial attraction between geolocated crowdsourced photos and the affected buildings. The collected photos of the affected buildings were taken near affected buildings extracted from remote sensing data. The result did not show significant attraction at small distances, which can be explained with the fact that people were taking pictures from safe not affected places. In fact, at small distances the significant attraction was recorded between not affected buildings and crowdsourced photos.\nThe main limitation of the analysis is that it is very much data driven, the reliability of the results depends on the quality of the input data. The crowdsourced images were geotagged manually by searching clue objects in the pictures, useful for location definition. In some cases, it was found out that the defined location was not precise. It turned out that images sharing the position of capturing were showing the damage of the same building but from different angles. For some buildings, the contradictions between two sources was found for the assessed damage type (see Appendix). The source of pre and post hurricane imagery used by the FEMA is not known and in some cases the reason for inconsistency could not be explained.\nTo conclude, this work has shown that real-time geolocated crowdsourced photos have potential as early indicators of the patterns of structural damage caused by a hurricane. Yet, it is necessary to apply the proposed analyses on other test cases in order to better understand the relationship between crowdsourced reports and damaged buildings. Analysing larger data sets will help to better assess the parameters needed for spatial modelling structural damage patterns following a hurricane. Crowdsourced platforms and social media are very powerful source of information and by increasing the awareness of their role in disaster management, valuable information could be obtained.","completion":"written"}
{"prompt":"Speaker 5: Three part of the Energy Environment Committee agenda and five cancel 1190 34 relating to the City Light Department declaring the city's eighth and Roy Street property surplus. The city's needs are no longer required for providing public utility services or other municipal purposes. The committee recommends the bill pass.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmembers two one.\nSpeaker 0: And how this ordinance authorizes city life to sell a surplus property on eighth and Roy City lighthouses add the property appraised and expects to get well over $30 million for it because it's in Salt Lake Union in a prime location and part of the revenue from the sale will go to the rate stabilization action, which may be sufficient to remove the 1.5% rate. So, Judge, that Seattleites have been paying for the last year on their city led bills. The Energy and Environment Committee discussed the possible uses for the property. Ideally, Seattle uses publicly owned property to build affordable housing in the midst of this housing crisis. However, this property is owned by City Light, not the city of Seattle, which means that legally, if any department wants it, the city needs to base a delightful market value. The Office of Housing in the Parks Department came to the committee meeting and explained that paying that much for this particular property to use for affordable housing or for a park in that location is not the best use of their funds if they have to pay full market value anyway, they have other properties that are a higher priority to purchase for housing or parks. So, you know, City Light has been sitting on this property without using it for anything for the past seven years and has no plan to use it for anything in the future. So the Energy and Environment Committee unanimously recommends that council pass this bill.\nSpeaker 1: Just very good. Any questions concerning Gonzales?\nSpeaker 4: Oh, no questions. I was just gonna make a comment, please. Okay. So I just wanted to talk a little bit about sort of where we're at with these surplus properties. A I think to me it's a little it's, it's, it's frustrating that we can't have more flexibility as it relates to surplus property that is in an area like South Lake Union. But unfortunately it is pretty clear under state law that this is rate payer regulated and that that as a result of that we have to strictly comply with the laws imposed upon us by the state as it relates to how we can manage disposition of this particular property. Our Office of Housing came to a hearing to our committee last week and testified that they have looked at the opportunity of purchasing and acquiring this land for purposes of building affordable housing. Twice since 2009, I believe, was the date and still have come to the same conclusion that it's just cost prohibitive to acquire this particular parcel . And our Parks Department also reviewed the opportunity to purchase this and likewise determined that this was not a good opportunity for them, given the cost. And I just want to highlight that if you do a public records search, you'll see that the risk to the city of not strictly complying with the state laws that are applicable to these two ratepayer property is quite, quite serious. And in fact, the city of Seattle has historically been sued approximately four times as a result of trying to find nuances as it relates to how we can sell and or otherwise utilize repair owned property. So just wanted to buttress the points that were made by Councilmember Salant that we heard in committee last week.\nSpeaker 1: Very good cuts from Johnson.\nSpeaker 7: Just wanted to ask a question. You know, we've gotten several communications, both from members of the public who are here today, but then also representatives of both the South Lake Union, Chamber of Commerce and other folks representing South Lake Union. I'm wondering if in particular, one of those organizations asked if there was an opportunity for jurisdictional transfer or for co-development of the property with city and other development companies that would allow for Cee Lo to maintain ownership but also have some co-development relationship to where those issues are addressed at all in committee. Were they explored at all by satellite? Is there.\nSpeaker 0: Believe that has ever come up but.\nSpeaker 4: I got I. Without waiving attorney client privilege, I have seen a memo that discusses pretty heavy restrictions on those types of proposals. I want to be really clear that it is my understanding that the property itself can be used for anything that the community wants it to be used for, but they have to pay fair market value . So whatever the appraisal fair market value is, that's what has to be paid and it can be used for anything that the Chamber of Commerce dreams up of or otherwise for. I mean, the question is the cost.\nSpeaker 7: Yeah, the cost piece. I understand the underlying piece related to it. It just seems to me that in a city where we continue to grow, both in terms of staff and in terms of population, that, you know, opportunities for us to have any kind of public property that can be maintained in our control or have some sort of joint use opportunity to it. You know, in particular, this letter from the South Lake Union Chamber of Commerce talks about co-development relationships. And and notwithstanding the committee discussions that I you know, I had to. You the person who lobs in a lot of questions here in the final yards. But it just seems to me like this is a very large missed opportunity and I recognize the legal ramifications. And I don't want to get us in hot water with any folks at the city attorney's office, but just want to make sure that we're doing our due diligence about turning over every rock humanly possible about options that might have been available to us around not, not just owned it, continued ownership of the property for city life, but also that ownership that may allow for other uses to continue. It sounds as though that that's the case, but I just want to make sure we're we're doing everything we can.\nSpeaker 1: Councilmember Herbold, thank you.\nSpeaker 4: I just want to take this opportunity to note that the recommendation to prioritize city owned property for housing purposes was a was a hollow recommendation. And though we have significant limitations that relates to property that's owned by our public utilities, not just city life, but also as Pugh, we have increased our sale of city properties and use either use those properties themselves for housing or use the proceeds for housing. Just from 2015 to 2017, there have been 12 properties that have been either the properties themselves, they're going to be housing built on them or the proceeds from the sale. The property is going to be used for affordable housing. Just in the last few months we've taken action on 1415 Eastchester Way and 1429 South Jackson. And I think there's a there's a strong commitment to this principle. And I understand that when we talk about the disposition properties in Councilmember Burgess's committee, that we're going to talk about how to better make sure that our disposition process really prioritizes the use of these properties whenever possible for affordable housing.\nSpeaker 6: And our first discussion is Wednesday morning of that.\nSpeaker 3: That's great.\nSpeaker 1: Kathryn Bigelow.\nSpeaker 0: Thank you. Councilmember Burgess, are you talking about this particular property? And, you know.\nSpeaker 6: We're talking in general about the cities disposition, policy process we follow for disposition.\nSpeaker 0: If you just follow up quickly and this is Councilmember Solon, Councilmember Gonzales, that you worked on this. Is it possible for us to extend the period of time councilmembers want? Is it possible for us to extend the period of time as Seattle City Life is putting this out to the public? Can we ask them to continue to explore alternatives, whether it's co-development or something, to allow this to happen? I mean, if the majority of the council want to do that, you can do that. But in my view, City Light has explored every possible option. And I thought Councilmember Gonzalez gave a good description from the legal standpoint, the severe restrictions they face. So my honest opinion would be you can hold it, but you want to have a different outcome. And we'll probably come back to the same point.\nSpeaker 4: I, I would concur with that opinion, an assessment that was just provided by council members to want. And I also want to be very clear that any further delay of action on this particular council bill will result in an impact to an ongoing impact to our ratepayers disposition of this property. At this juncture, given that the $33 million appraisal that we have will enable the utility to be able to remove the 1.5% surcharge that is currently being experienced by our city white ratepayers. And that's that's pretty significant. And I would urge us to not delay any further, particularly given since this has been reviewed and reviewed and reviewed since since 2009, based on the presentation provided to us by the departments.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I think that's time for a vote, Councilman, which is.\nSpeaker 0: Just as the Chair of Parks and being the vice chair with council members who want I mean, the history here, we've had it in committee twice and it was Department of Parks are Seattle City Light transported Department of parks in 92 and then then it killed Parks transferred it back to Sea Light in 2003. And I want to follow up on what Councilmember Gonzalez said about the delay in the cost in the money, and that the money would be going back and correct me if I'm wrong. CUSTOMER So why don't we go back to the rent stabilization rate I'm sorry, rate stabilization account. But the other concern is, and we've we've been to committee hearings where we have heard from Department of Parks and Rec that they do not want this property. We heard from Office of Housing that they do not want this property. It's pretty, pretty vetted, pretty clear. And also going back on what Councilmember Gonzalez said without on the legal opinion and the justification, it's it's just it's just time. So we need to do it.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Let's, let's please call the roll on the passage of the bill.\nSpeaker 7: Johnson I.\nSpeaker 0: Suarez Yeah.\nSpeaker 2: So what I think John Burgess Gonzalez proposed president Harrell eight in favor and unopposed.\nSpeaker 1: Bill passed and chair of the Senate please read the report of the Civil Rights, Utilities, Economic Development and Arts Committee.","completion":"spoken"}
