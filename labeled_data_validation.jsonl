{"prompt":"and witnessing from an unbiased place what exactly is happening every day in these shelters. and so just wanted to put that out there and we'll be in communication. thank you. thank you, madam secretary, please put the next item on our screen. council member can each go ahead with your comments on resolution one, four, four, four? thank you. council president pro tem. this is a contract for security services here in our city facilities and i think maybe up to 40 some facilities. so human services, different buildings. and we have had some history with our service contracts in the city recently, as we saw at the airport where the janitorial staff went on strike, we actually had disruptions to the workplace. the disruptions included, you know, a work stoppage, two separate days. and, you know, in spite of the efforts of everyone at the airport to to provide backup disruptions due to labor unrest are bad for our city and they're bad for business. and so one of the first priorities i have when i look at our service contracts is to make sure, are we doing everything we can to avoid economic disruption? are we doing everything we can to live up to our city's values in those contracts? some things are within our control. to set terms for other things have to be determined between the workers and the employers outside the city's control. but the important thing always is that there is a commitment to do those negotiations and those discussions and that we as a city have assurance that there's not going to be disruption. we had a conversation in committee about the securitas security contract a couple of weeks ago, and we received numerous reassurances that there would be good dialog with the workers and with their representatives, and that has just not occurred yet. i'm disappointed to hear that there is a lot of confusion among workers, and this happens when contracts turn over, right? there is a policy now that says you have a right to keep your job, but there are questions among those workers about the terms that they're going to be keeping those jobs under. and the best way to avoid the disruption that can occur with workers maybe getting cold feet, not being sure if they want to stay on, not being sure what's happening is to work in partnership. it is to sit at the table. it is to work together and to make sure that all the communication is as clear as it can be. to make sure that the parties understand what the commitments have been made and that those commitments are going to be kept and that the workers will have a seat at the table . i'm disappointed that those things have not occurred. and so with that, i am asking for this council to, you know, delay this for one week in the hopes that this company will sit down with the workers representatives and assure us in their next appearance before this council that we will not have disruptions because the conversations and the collaboration have not occurred. this is security contracting. it's not janitorial. it's much more complex to find workers to back up and to be in place. we just can't risk another round of disruption in one of our service contracts where it is avoidable. where good conversations and good dialog can clarify communication, clarify intent, and wherever possible, get to as much certainty as possible before this council is asked to vote. so for those reasons, i hope that my colleagues will stay engaged in the week that intervenes here and that they will express their similar support for this dialog to continue. this does not require a vote tonight. this is a special motion that we created when we moved our contracts from two reading bills to one reading bill. and so i think it's an important tool. i don't use it often, but this is an example where i think more partnership and dialog is needed. i understand we're near the end of the year and this is an important contract and we always wish the administration brought these things a little quicker to us so we weren't quite under such a tight timeline. but i think the importance of avoiding disruptions that are foreseeable and preventable is important enough to make sure the parties understand the seriousness of getting to the table and talking. so with that, i think the council president for accepting my motion tonight and invoking of this rule, and i look forward to hearing that some dialog and communication clarifications have been made so that we can feel good that this contract turnover will occur smoothly. thank you. thank you. councilmember hines. i thank you. council president. i want to thank councilmember for her comments. i want the record to know that she is not alone. i agree and i'm sure others do too. thank you. council president. thank you. council resolution 144, four. we'll be back before council for consideration on monday, december 20th. madam secretary, please put the next item on our screen. councilmember hines, go ahead with your comments on resolution 1438.","completion":"spoken"}

{"prompt":"webvtt kind captions language en before we go into the details of the cuban missile crisis, it's important to understand the world's environment entering into october of 1962. in 1959, you have a revolution in cuba led by fidel castro. and he is heading the communist party there. cuba is now a communist nation right off of the coast of the united states. this is the middle of the cold war. the u.s. believes in a strategy of containment, does not this. so in 1961, the united states, the cia, the kennedy administration, they try using cuban exiles, people who have left cuba, they try to support them to enter and invade cuba at the bay of pigs. but, the whole effort wasn't planned properly. the support for the cuban exiles, the counter-revolutionaries, those who were trying to oust castro, it was kind of this half-hearted effort. and it was this big failure. so the bay of bigs invasion was a failure in 1961. and it made john f. kennedy seem a little bit weak. it made the cia seem weak. it didn't make anyone on the american side look all that competent, because of that failure. on top of that, we're in the middle of the cold war, remember this. and at the same time, if you go to what the us was doing around the soviet union, it started placing missiles, starting in the late 50's, all the way into 1961 and 1962 --- it started placing medium-ranged ballistic missiles in turkey and in italy. these are where they were allocated. and the significance of that is that now these missiles could reach the major population centers of the soviet union in really a matter of minutes, in 10 to 20 minutes, i think. 16 minutes was how long most of these stayed airborne. and in a situation where both sides have nuclear weapons, there was this kind of notion of well, maybe if you're able to get to the other guy faster, they wouldn't be able to retaliate, and maybe you wouldn't have that mutually assured destruction. so there's this whole idea that you want to get your missiles as close as possible to your enemies so that they could reach the populations centers, the strategic centers of your opponent, as quickly as possible. and if you look up on the web, you can actually find the actual missile sites, and where they were installed, and when they became operational. these are the ones that were in italy, kind of right here, near the heel of italy. so you have this environment, the united states was looking a little bit weak after the bay of pigs invasion. it looks they wanted to oust castro, but they weren't able to do it. they weren't able because they were slightly inept. and at the same time you could imagine that the soviet union did not appreciate the united states placing these missiles so close to its population centers. missiles that could reach its population centers very easily. so now, we fast forward to october of 1962 and the entire cuban missile crisis will occur over 13 or 14 days during october of 1962. so, on the 14th of october we're sending these u2 spy planes over cuba. so this right here is a u2 spy plane. that is a u2 spy plane. and it takes pictures that look this. and on the next day, on october 15th, you have the cia analysts. and they're saying, wow - that looks missiles over there. this looks ballistic missiles that are being set up, that are being set up in cuba. and so all of a sudden, it looks the soviet union is using cuba to do the same thing that we used turkey and italy for, to set up ballistic missiles, really, right off of our coast -- and ballistic missiles that could now now reach any of the strategic population centers, especially on the east coast or the midwest of the united states. so by the 16th-- so this is literally two days after the pictures were taken. the next day, they're analyzing them, and they tell the state department about them. on the 16th, they tell kennedy about them, and kennedy holds a meeting of the executive committee. it wasn't called excomm, just yet. but it was really a subset of special advisors -- a subset of the national security council and other advisors that essentially become the brain trust to figure out what to do about this forming crisis. because of all of a sudden you have a state that we don't off of our borders -- a communist state -- a state aligned with the soviet union. all of a sudden, it has nuclear missiles. it looks these are offensive weapons. these are weapons being designed for a first-strike capability. once again, if they're being launched from cuba, maybe they can attack -- maybe they can obliterate the us before the us even has an opportunity to respond properly. so this really freaks out the kennedy administration. and so they start to think about what can they do about it and early on-- well, there's a couple-- you could just kind of call and talk to the soviets about it and say hey, we don't that. why don't you undo your missiles? but they didn't really think that that would have any significant effect on the soviets. especially, because they probably thought that kennedy was weak at this point. and just to understand who was leading the soviets at this time, it was khrushchev. (this is khrushchev right over here.) and he had even made remarks to the effect that he thought that kennedy was young and may be naive, and maybe too intellectual to really play a good game of chicken here. and so the us kind of felt that it had to look strong here. and so the only real options on the table were maybe blockade cuba - and so a blockade could be an 'all out' blockade, so it would be an economic blockade. but then that's actually considered an act of war because you are, to a large degree, starving a country. another option for the united states, (because it was completely viewed as unacceptable that these missiles should be here, and that they should be deployable from cuba), the other option would be to do air attacks on these missile silos. and then the most extreme action would be to actually invade cuba. and ,obviously that goes in line with, the us' general interest of not having a communist regime so close to its own borders. so, this is what kennedy and his team was wrestling with. and really early on in these early days, most of the team was actually advising kennedy that they should do a full-scale invasion of cuba. they thought that this was the only thing that the soviets would take seriously, it would show that the us is serious about this. and they didn't think that the soviet union would really try to put up a fight in cuba, so far away from their own borders. but kennedy, probably thinking about it pretty reasonably, realized well, hey. they might not do anything in cuba, and they might allow us to oust castro and install a new regime there. but they might retaliate, in fact, they probably would retaliate in europe, but specifically, in berlin, probably in germany as a whole. so, just for the sake of getting these things out of cuba, we could sacrifice a lot in europe. and even more, that any type of conflict between the us and the soviet union could easily escalate to a nuclear war. so these were all on the table. the us goes on high alert. it prepares for any of these situations, because they really don't know what's going to happen. the army, the air force and the navy start mobilizing. so, on, kind of with hours notice, any of those options can, kind of, go into effect. by the 22nd, you have the executive committee -- (and that just becomes formalized as an actual, official group that is advising the president in this capacity.) -- and on the 22nd, kennedy finally puts out his first salvo on what is the us' position on what's going on here. and before this -- just to make things clear -- on the 18th, he did meet, he did meet with the minister of foreign affairs, the soviet minister of foreign affairs, andrei gromyko -- and i'm sure i'm butchering the pronunciations -- and this is where the first time, kennedy is hey, you've got these offensive weapons... and gromyko is insisting that no, they're just defensive weapons. and, to most people, defensive weapons would mean things surface-to-air missiles, things that would stop planes from bombings. but not surface-to-surface missiles, not something that could attack a country. but we'll see, in future letters from khrushchev, that maybe they actually did perceive these missiles as somehow being defensive. but you fast forward. that was on the 18th, it kind of made, it made kennedy and the us frustrated with the russians, because it felt the americans are saying, look, we clearly know you have missiles there, but gromyko is saying no, these are just defensive weapons - nothing to worry about. why are you taking this so seriously? the 19th us goes on high alert. it starts thinking about all of these options. the 22nd this committee is formed formally. but more importantly, kennedy gives a speech to state the united states' opinion. and i'll just read it right here to halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba is being initiated. all ships of any kind bound for cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargos of offensive weapons, be turned back. this quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers. we are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life, as the soviets attempted to do in their berlin blockade of 1948. so, the kennedy administration's position became slightly more nuanced. they said we can't do an all out blockade. 1) that is an act of war; 2) that is, to a large degree, inhumane. why should we starve the cuban people? what we're gonna do is, kind of a filter on the cargo going into cuba. we will only inspect things that we suspect are holding armaments, and we will only turn back the ships that are actually doing it. but then on the 24th, there is a cable from khrushchev, and it say, if you cooly weigh the situation which has developed, not giving away to passions, you will understand that the soviet union cannot fail to reject the arbitrary demands of the united states -- and that the soviet union views the blockade as an act of aggression, and that their ships will be instructed to ignore it. so the game of chicken is beginning to emerge. the united states if just saying look, this is unacceptable. we're gonna stop you from shipping arms to cuba. on the 24th, khrushchev is saying who are you to tell us what to do? and, you know, there's this kind of under current , wait, you've already got stuff set up in italy and turkey, not too far from us. how can you dare... -- (you know, and they call it a blockade, even though the us is calling it a quarantine) -- this is an act of aggression and we will ignore it. so both parties are kind of saying, we don't care what you're gonna do. we're gonna do what whatever we have to do and this whole time, both sides are getting tense, the whole world is kind of taking sides, they're making public statements about what's right or wrong. so, we really are getting very close to the brink of a very major confrontation between the soviet union and the united states. and you know, you can read the book 13 days - robert kennedy, there's also the movie 13 days, which actually is not based on the book. but both of them really kind of give the account of what happened over this period. but then you fast forward to the 25th and kennedy essentially replies, look, these are offensive weapons and these require the responses i have announced. i hope that your government will take necessary action to permit restoration of the earlier situation. ok, so he's saying - look, we have to do this. these are offensive weapons. we cannot tolerate these weapons so close to us borders. and so, also on the 25th, the quarantine is in effect. it does get challenged. the us does start to inspect some ships. they try to inspect one ship that got away a little bit. so the soviets, even though they're speaking the game of chicken, they are turning back. they did turn back 14 ships. and the best guess is that those 14 ships probably did contain some type of armament. so even though, publicly, everyone is playing a very strong game, behind the scenes, there is a little bit of a softening of the stance. and then you fast forward to the 26th, and khrushchev essentially sends his first proposal. and it's interesting here. because, in khrushchev's mind -- (and this is a fascinating letter to read. it's a fairly long letter, so i'm not gonna go into the whole thing and you can get it at this url right over here. it's a fascinating letter. maybe i'll do a whole video where i just read this letter.) he kind of goes into the nuance of what he views as a defensive or an offensive weapon. he implicitly admits that the missiles are there -- that they're not these benign weapons. but, in his letter, he kind of makes the nuance that he'd use them as defensive weapons. he says look, you guys attempted to oust castro already. we view castro as an ally. we think that by placing these weapons here, that you will be less likely to be able to oust castro, because you will be afraid of these weapons. so, khrushchev is kind of setting up-- kruschev is saying, we don't have the intention of using these to attack you for no reason. we're just putting these here to essentially defend one of our allies. so he's saying that's the reason. that's the reason that they placed those weapons there in the first place. he's kind of saying look, you did bay of pigs. you were the ones that took the first shot. now we are defending it. that might have been the rationale. another rationale for why they did it -- and it's just, and probably the more strategic rationale -- is that we already did have these missiles that were pointed at the soviet union in turkey and italy. and the soviet union just wanted to have parity. so, they wanted to put missiles near the us in some ally's country, from the soviet union's point of view. so, on the 26th, khrushchev's first proposa,l that was given through a cable, says if assurances were given by the president and the government of the united states that the usa itself would not participate... - so 'assurances'... (let me underline this in a different color.) -- assurances that the usa itself would not participate in an attack on cuba, and would restrain others from actions of this sort -- probably the cuban exiles -- ... if you would recall your fleet, this would immediately change everything. i am not speaking for fidel castro, but i think that he and the government of cuba evidently would declare demobilization and would appeal to the people to get down to peaceful labor. then, too, the question of-- (and, you know, the communists always talking about labor.) -- then, too, the question of armaments would disappear, since, if there is no threat, then armaments are a burden for every people. so in this first proposal that came over a cable, he's essentially saying look, if you guys just promise not to attack cuba, if you just make 'assurances' that you will not attack cuba, then we'll essentially undo everything. we'll give in to your wishes. and this stance right here really does make it look their main interest in having those missiles was, kind of, to protect cuba -- so that the us would not try to oust the communists from there. but then on the next day, khrushchev has a public broadcast where he kind of changes his tone a little bit. now he's saying that they would undo the situation in cuba only if the united states removed their missiles from italy and turkey. so, he's sending little mixed messages. his first message was kind of a softer stance look, you guys just promise not to invade cuba and we're gonna pull out of cuba. the second stance is saying no, no. we're only gonna take our missiles out of cuba if you take your missiles out of italy and turkey. and on the same day, another u2 spy plane gets shot down over cuba. this is when both armies are really at, kind of, they're at hair-trigger notice, it's a really scary situation. and this was actually done by-- it was a local decision by a soviet commander. (and khrushchev actually did not want this to happen.) and lucky for, i guess, the world, the us did not use this, alone, as a reason to engage in war. they said maybe it's an accident. if this happens again, then we'll use it as a pretext for war. so it was lucky that this did not trigger an immediate war with the soviets. but the kennedy administration still had the question which of these was a more serious, you know, which of these requests were the soviets really making? this is a more significant request. are they requesting for both? and so it was eventually decided, on the 27th, that hey, let's just pretend we didn't even know -- that the americans didn't even know about the second request that asked for more -- and let's just reply to this first request. so, you essentially have kennedy agreeing with khrushchev, and saying ok, we'll do your first request. we will agree not to invade cuba if you remove your missiles. and then, essentially, what happens--. and that puts khrushchev in a weird situation. (because this is something that he did recommend. but they were ignoring this over here.) but through back channels we said well, we'll offically agree to this. but through back channels the kennedy administration said and we would also be on an understanding, we will also have an understanding on the missiles in italy and turkey. that, look, this isn't part of the deal, but we see what you're saying and we're probably, we're probably going to remove them. and what the soviets also didn't know at that time is that the americans were planning on -- that these missiles, to a large degree, by this point in time, were already obsolete. because we already polaris missiles that were deployable by submarines. and clearly, submarines can deploy things much closer to the action, and they're much harder to track. you can't surveil them and all the rest. so the us kind of agreed to it. but they did it secretly. and the whole point here is that neither side wanted to look they're giving in. neither side wanted to look weak. but on the 28th, there was finally an agreement. and so, publicly, the first khrushchev proposal was agreed to by both khrushchev and the united states. khrushchev agreed to remove -- to not send any more weapons, and also dismantle the weapons that were there, and the americans agreed that they would not invade cuba. so you can imagine the big winner here. the big winner here is probably fidel castro, because the whole time he's paranoid that the us is planning another attack on him. and, at least publicly now, they're saying that they cannot invade him. and if they did, it would they're going back on their word. and privately, the us agreed to remove its missiles from turkey and italy. they didn't wanna do this publicly, because then it would they were being weak. then it would the soviets were able to do this aggressive action. and by doing it, they were able to extract something out of the united states. which is actually the reality. they were able to -- by doing this action, they were able to get these missiles removed from turkey and italy. but the united states wanted to look strong. kennedy has, well -- there's always an approaching election. especially after the bay of pigs, he needed to look a strong leader. and so, to some degree, you have to give khrushchev credit for this. he kind of swallowed his pride and allowed it to publicly look he lost the negotiation. he publicly made it look he got nothing in return for backing down, but in reality he did. he just didn't necessarily get credit for it. but this was a big deal. because this was the closest that the soviet union and the us ever got to really the brink during the cold war.","completion":"spoken"}

{"prompt":"the following is a conversation with thomas sandholm. he's a professor at sameu and co-creator of labratas, which is the first ai system to beat top human players in the game of heads up, no limit, texas hold'em. he has published over 450 papers on game theory and machine learning, including a best paper in 2017 at nips, now renamed to newrips, which is where i caught up with him for this conversation. his research and companies have had wide-reaching impact in the real world, especially because he and his group not only propose new ideas, but also build systems to prove that these ideas work in the real world. this conversation is part of the mit course on artificial general intelligence and the artificial intelligence podcast. if you enjoy it, subscribe on youtube, itunes, or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman, spelled f-r-i-d. and now, here's my conversation with thomas sandholm. can you describe at the high level the game of poker, heads up, texas hold'em, for people who might not be familiar with this card game? yeah, happy to. so heads up, no limit, texas hold'em has really emerged in the ai community as a main benchmark for testing these application independent algorithms for imperfect information game solving. and this is a game that's actually played by humans. you don't see that much on tv or casinos because, well, for various reasons, but you do see it in some expert level casinos and you see it in the best poker movies of all time. it's actually an event in the world series of poker, but mostly it's played online and typically for pretty big sums of money. and this is a game that usually only experts play. so if you go to your home game on a friday night, it probably is not going to be heads up, no limit, texas hold'em. it might be no limit, texas hold'em in some cases, but typically for a big group and it's not as competitive. while heads up means it's two players. so it's really me against you. am i better or are you better? much chess or go in that sense, but an imperfect information game, which makes it much harder because i have to deal with issues of you knowing things that i don't know and i know things that you don't know instead of pieces being nicely laid on the board for both of us to see. so in texas hold'em, there's two cards that you only see that belong to you. yeah. and there is, they gradually lay out some cards that add up overall to five cards that everybody can see. yeah. so the imperfect nature of the information is the two cards that you're holding up front. yeah. so as you said, you first get two cards in private each and then there's a betting round. then you get three cards in public on the table. then there's a betting round. then you get the fourth card in public on the table. there's a betting round. then you get the fifth card on the table. there's a betting round. so there's a total of four betting rounds and four tranches of information revelation, if you will. only the first tranche is private and then it's public from there. and this is probably by far the most popular game in ai and just the general public in terms of imperfect information. so it's probably the most popular spectator game to watch, right? so which is why it's a super exciting game to tackle. so it's on the order of chess, i would say, in terms of popularity, in terms of ai setting it as the bar of what is intelligence. so in 2017, lebrados, how do you pronounce it? lebrados. lebrados. lebrados beats... a little latin there. a little bit of latin. lebrados beat a few, four expert human players. can you describe that event? what you learned from it? what was it ? what was the process in general for people who have not read the papers and studied? yeah. so the event was that we invited four of the top 10 players, who are specialist players in heads up no limit texas hold'em, which is very important because this game is actually quite different than the multiplayer version. we brought them in to pittsburgh to play at the reverse casino for 20 days. we wanted to get 120,000 hands in because we wanted to get statistical significance. so it's a lot of hands for humans to play, even for these top pros who play fairly quickly normally. so we couldn't just have one of them play so many hands. 20 days they were playing basically morning to evening. and i raised 200,000 as a little incentive for them to play. and the setting was so that they didn't all get 50,000. we actually paid them out based on how they did against ai each. so they had an incentive to play as hard as they could, whether they're way ahead or way behind or right at the mark of beating the ai. and you don't make any money, unfortunately. right. no, we can't make any money. so originally, a couple of years earlier, i actually explored whether we could actually play for money because that would be, of course, interesting as well to play against the top people for money. but the pennsylvania gaming board said no. so we couldn't. so this is much an exhibit, for a musician or a boxer or something that. nevertheless, you were keeping track of the money and brought us one close to $2 million i think. so if it was for real money, if you were able to earn money, that was a quite impressive and inspiring achievement. just a few details. what were the players looking at? were they behind a computer? what was the interface ? yes, they were playing much they normally do. these top players, when they play this game, they play mostly online. so they're used to playing through a ui. and they did the same thing here. so there was this layout. you could imagine there's a table on the screen. there's the human sitting there. and then there's the ai sitting there. and the screen shows everything that's happening. the cards coming out and shows the bets being made. and we also had the betting history for the human. so if the human forgot what had happened in the hand so far, they could actually reference back and so forth. is there a reason they were given access to the betting history for? well, it didn't really matter. they wouldn't have forgotten anyway. these are top quality people. but we just wanted to put out there so it's not a question of the human forgetting and the ai somehow trying to get advantage of better memory. so what was that ? i mean, that was an incredible accomplishment. so what did it feel before the event? did you have doubt, hope? or where was your confidence at? yeah, that's great. great question. so 18 months earlier, i had organized a similar brains versus ai competition with our previous ai called cloudico. and we couldn't beat the humans. so this time around, it was only 18 months later. and i knew that this new ai, libratus, was way stronger. but it's hard to say how you'll do against the top humans before you try. so i thought we had about a 50-50 shot. and the international betting sites put us as a four to one or five to one underdog. so it's kind of interesting that people really believe in people and over ai. people don't just over believe in themselves, but they have overconfidence in other people as well compared to the performance of ai. and yeah, so we were a four to one or five to one underdog. and even after three days of beating the humans in a row, we were still 50-50 on the international betting sites. do you think there's something special and magical about poker and the way people think about it? in a sense, you have, i mean, even in chess, there's no hollywood movies. poker is the star of many movies. and there's this feeling that certain human facial expressions and body language, eye movement, all these tells are critical to poker. like you can look into somebody's soul and understand their betting strategy and so on. so that's probably why, possibly, do you think that is why people have a confidence that humans will outperform, because ai systems cannot, in this construct, perceive these kinds of tells. they're only looking at betting patterns and nothing else, the betting patterns and statistics. so what's more important to you if you step back on human players, human versus human, what's the role of these tells, of these ideas that we romanticize? yeah. so i'll split it into two parts. so one is why do humans trust humans more than ai and have overconfidence in humans? i think that's not really related to the tell question. it's just that they've seen these top players, how good they are, and they're really fantastic. so it's just hard to believe that an ai could beat them. so i think that's where that comes from. and that's actually maybe a more general lesson about ai, that until you've seen it overperform a human, it's hard to believe that it could. but then the tells, a lot of these top players, they're so good at hiding tells that among the top players, it's actually not really worth it for them to invest a lot of effort trying to find tells in each other, because they're so good at hiding them. so yes, at the kind of friday evening game, tells are going to be a huge thing. you can read other people and if you're a good reader, you'll read them an open book. but at the top levels of poker now, the tells become a much smaller and smaller aspect of the game as you go to the top levels. the amount of strategies, the amounts of possible actions is very large, 10 to the power of 100 plus. so there has to be some, i've read a few of the papers related, it has to form some abstractions of various hands and actions. so what kind of abstractions are effective for the game of poker? yeah, so you're exactly right. so when you go from a game tree, that's 10 to the 161, especially in an imperfect information game, it's way too large to solve directly, even with our fastest equilibrium finding algorithms. so you want to abstract it first. and abstraction in games is much trickier than abstraction in mdps or other single agent settings, because you have these abstraction pathologies that if i have a finer grained abstraction, the strategy that i can get from that for the real game might actually be worse than the strategy i can get from the coarse grained abstraction. so you have to be very careful. now the kinds of abstractions just to zoom out, we're talking about there's the hands abstractions and then there's betting strategies. yeah, betting actions. yeah, so there's information abstraction, talk about general games, information abstraction, which is the abstraction of what chance does. and this would be the cards in the case of poker. and then there's action abstraction, which is abstracting the actions of the actual players, which would be bets in the case of poker. yourself and the other players? yes, yourself and other players. and for information abstraction, we were completely automated. so these were, these are algorithms, but they do what we call potential aware abstraction, where we don't just look at the value of the hand, but also how it might materialize in the good or bad hands over time. and it's a certain kind of bottom up process with integer programming there and clustering and various aspects, how do you build this abstraction? and then in the action abstraction there, it's largely based on how humans and other ai's have played this game in the past. but in the beginning, we actually use an automated action abstraction technology, which is provably convergent and that it finds the optimal combination of bet sizes, but it's not very scalable. so we couldn't use it for the whole game, but we used it for the first couple of betting actions. so what's more important, the strength of the hand, so the information abstraction or the how you play them, the actions, does it, you know, the romanticized notion again is that it doesn't matter what hands you have, that the actions, the betting may be the way you win no matter what hands you have. yeah. so that's why you have to play a lot of hands so that the role of luck gets smaller. so you could otherwise get lucky and get some good hands and then you're going to win the match. even with thousands of hands, you can get lucky because there's so much variance in no limit texas hold'em because if we both go all in, it's a huge stack of variance. so there are these massive swings in no limit texas hold'em. so that's why you have to play not just thousands, but over a hundred thousand hands to get statistical significance. so let me ask another way this question. if you didn't even look at your hands, but they didn't know that, your opponents didn't know that, how well would you be able to do? that's a good question. there's actually, i heard this story that there's this norwegian female poker player called annette oberstad who's actually won a tournament by doing exactly that, but that would be extremely rare. so you cannot really play well that way. so the hands do have some role to play. yes. so lebradis does not use, as far as i understand, use learning methods, deep learning. is there room for learning? there's no reason why lebradis doesn't combine with an alphago type approach for estimating the quality for a function estimator. what are your thoughts on this, maybe as compared to another algorithm, which i'm not that familiar with, deepstack, the engine that does use deep learning that is unclear how well it does, but nevertheless uses deep learning. so what are your thoughts about learning methods to aid in the way that lebradis plays? in the way that lebradis plays the game of poker. yeah. so as you said, lebradis did not use learning methods and played very well without them. since then we have actually, actually here, we have a couple of papers on things that do use learning techniques and deep learning in particular. and sort of the way you're talking about where it's learning an evaluation function. but in imperfect information games, unlike, let's say in go, or now also in chess and shogi, it's not sufficient to learn an evaluation for a state because the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but it also depends on both players' beliefs. like if i have a bad hand, i'm much better off if the opponent thinks i have a good hand and vice versa. if i have a good hand, i'm much better off if the opponent believes i have a bad hand. so the value of a state is not just a function of the cards. it depends on, if you will, the path of play, but only to the extent that is captured in the belief distributions. so that's why it's not as simple as it is in perfect information games. and i don't want to say it's simple there either. it's of course very complicated computationally there too, but at least conceptually it's very straightforward. there's a state, there's an evaluation function. you can try to learn it. here you have to do something more. and what we do is in one of these papers, we're looking at allowing, where we allow the opponent to actually take different strategies at the leaf of the search tree, if you will. and that is a different way of doing it. and it doesn't assume there for a particular way that the opponent plays, but it allows the opponent to choose from a set of different continuation strategies. and that forces us to not be too optimistic in our lookahead search. and that's one way you can do sound lookahead search in imperfect information games, which is very difficult. and you were asking about deepstack. what they did, it was very different than what we do, either in libratus or in this new work. they were randomly generating various situations in the game. then they were doing the lookahead from there to the end of the game, as if that was the start of a different game. and then they were using deep learning to learn those values of those states. but the states were not just the physical states. they include the belief distributions. when you talk about lookahead for deepstack or with libratus, does it mean considering every possibility that the game can evolve? are we talking about extremely sort of this exponentially growth of a tree? yes. so we're talking about exactly that. much you do in alpha beta search or monte carlo tree search, but with different techniques. so there's a different search algorithm. and then we have to deal with the leaves differently. so if you think about what libratus did, we didn't have to worry about this because we only did it at the end of the game. so we would always terminate into a real situation and we would know what the payout is. it didn't do these depth limited lookaheads. but now in this new paper, which is called depth limited, i think it's called depth limited search for imperfect information games, we can actually do sound depth limited lookaheads. so we can actually start to do the lookahead from the beginning of the game on because that's too complicated to do for this whole long game. so in libratus, we were just doing it for the end. so, and then the other side, this belief distribution. so is it explicitly modeled what kind of beliefs that the opponent might have? yeah, yeah, it is explicitly modeled, but it's not assumed. the beliefs are actually output, not input. of course, the starting beliefs are input, but they just fall from the rules of the game because we know that the dealer deals uniformly from the deck. so i know that every pair of cards that you might have is equally likely. i know that for a fact, that just follows from the rules of the game. of course, except the two cards that i have, i know you don't have those. you have to take that into account. that's called card removal and that's very important. is the dealing always coming from a single deck in heads up? so you can assume... single deck. so you know that if i have the ace of spades, i know you don't have an ace of spades. great. so in the beginning, your belief is basically the fact that it's a fair dealing of hands, but how do you start to adjust that belief? well, that's where this beauty of game theory comes. so nash equilibrium, which john nash introduced in 1950, introduces what rational play is when you have more than one player. and these are pairs of strategies where strategies are contingency plans, one for each player. so that neither player wants to deviate to a different strategy, given that the other doesn't deviate. but as a side effect, you get the beliefs from base rule. so nash equilibrium really isn't just deriving in these imperfect information games. nash equilibrium doesn't just define strategies. it also defines beliefs for both of us and defines beliefs for each state. so at each state, each, if they're called information sets, at each information set in the game, there's a set of different states that we might be in, but i don't know which one we're in. nash equilibrium tells me exactly what is the probability distribution over those real world states in my mind. how does nash equilibrium give you that distribution? so why... i'll do a simple example. so you know the game rock, paper, scissors. so we can draw it as player one moves first and then player two moves. but of course, it's important that player two doesn't know what player one moved. otherwise player two would win every time. so we can draw that as an information set where player one makes one of three moves first. and then there's an information set for player two. so player two doesn't know which of those nodes the world is in. but once we know the strategy for player one, nash equilibrium will say that you play one third rock, one third paper, one third scissors. from that, i can derive my beliefs on the information set that they're one third, one third, one third. so bayes gives you that. bayes gives you. but is that specific to a particular player or is it something you quickly update with the specific player? no, the game theory isn't really player specific. so that's also why we don't need any data. we don't need any history how these particular humans played in the past or how any ai or even had played before. it's all about rationality. so the ai just thinks about what would a rational opponent do? and what would i do if i am rational? and that's the idea. i am rational. and that's the idea of game theory. so it's really a data-free, opponent-free approach. so it comes from the design of the game as opposed to the design of the player. exactly. there's no opponent modeling per se. i mean, we've done some work on combining opponent modeling with game theory so you can exploit weak players even more. but that's another strand. and in lee brothers, we didn't turn that on because i decided that these players are too good. and when you start to exploit an opponent, you typically open yourself up to exploitation. and these guys have so few holes to exploit and they're world's leading experts in counter-exploitation. so i decided that we're not going to turn that stuff on. actually, i saw a few papers exploiting opponents. it sounded very interesting to explore. do you think there's room for exploitation generally outside of lebron? is there subject or people differences that could be exploited, maybe not just in poker, but in general interactions and negotiations, all these other domains that you're considering? yeah, definitely. we've done some work on that. and i really the work that hybridizes the two. so you figure out what would a rational opponent do. and by the way, that's safe in these zero-sum games, two-player zero-sum games, because if the opponent does something irrational, yes, it might throw off my beliefs. but the amount that the player can gain by throwing off my belief is always less than they lose by playing poorly. so it's safe. but still, if somebody's weak as a player, you might want to play differently to exploit them more. so you can think about it this way. a game theoretic strategy is unbeatable, but it doesn't maximally beat the other opponent. so the winnings per hand might be better with a different strategy. and the hybrid is that you start from a game theoretic approach. and then as you gain data about the opponent in certain parts of the game tree, then in those parts of the game tree, you start to tweak your strategy more and more towards exploitation, while still staying fairly close to the game theoretic strategy so as to not open yourself up to exploitation too much. hoffman how do you do that? do you try to vary up strategies, make it unpredictable? it's , what is it, tit for tat strategies in prisoner's dilemma or? bastien well, it hasn't that that's a repeated game kind of repeated games, prisoner's dilemma, repeated games. but even there, there's no proof that says that that's the best thing. but experimentally, it actually does does well. hoffman so what kind of games are there, first of all, i don't know if this is something that you could just summarize. there's perfect information games, or all the information is on the table. there is imperfect information games. there's repeated games that you play over and over. there's zero sum games. there's non zero sum games. and then there's a really important distinction you're making two player versus more players. so what are what other games are there? and what's the difference, for example, with this two player game versus more players? what are the key differences? bastien right. so let me start from the the basics. so a repeated game is a game where the same exact game is played over and over. in these extensive form games, where we think about tree form, maybe with these information sets to represent incomplete information, you can have kind of repetitive interactions. even repeated games are a special case of that, by the way. but the game doesn't have to be exactly the same. it's in sourcing options. yes, we're going to see the same supply base year to year. but what i'm buying is a little different every time and the supply base is a little different every time and so on. so it's not really repeated. so to find a purely repeated game is actually very rare in the world. so they're really a very coarse model of what's going on. then if you move up from just repeated simple repeated matrix games, not all the way to extensive form games, but in between the stochastic games, where you think about it these little matrix games. and when you take an action and your home takes an action, they determine not which next game i'm going to, but the distribution of our next games where i might be going to. so that's the stochastic game. but it's matrix games repeated, stochastic games, extensive form games. that is from less to more general. and poker is an example of the last one. so it's really in the most general setting, extensive form games. and that's kind of what the ai community has been working on and been benchmarked on with this heads up no limit texas hold. can you describe extensive form games? what's the model here? yeah. so if you're familiar with the tree form, so it's really the tree form, in chess, there's a search tree versus a matrix. yeah. and the matrix is called the matrix form or by matrix form or normal form game. and here you have the tree form. so you can actually do certain types of reasoning there that you lose the information when you go to normal form. there's a certain form of equivalence. like if you go from tree form and you say it, every possible contingency plan is a strategy. then i can actually go back to the normal form, but i lose some information from the lack of sequentiality. then the multiplayer versus two player distinction is an important one. so two player games in zero sum are conceptually easier and computationally easier. they're still huge this one, but they're conceptually easier and computationally easier in that conceptually you don't have to worry about which equilibrium is the other guy going to play when there are multiple, because any equilibrium strategy is a best response to any other equilibrium strategy. so i can play a different equilibrium from you and we'll still get the right values of the game. that falls apart even with two players, when you have a general sum games. even without cooperation, just even without cooperation. so there's a big gap from two players zero sum to two player general sum or even to three players zero sum. that's a big gap, at least in theory. can you maybe non-mathematically provide the intuition why it all falls apart with three or more players? it seems you should still be able to have a nash equilibrium that's instructive, that holds. okay. so it is true that all finite games have a nash equilibrium. so this is what your nash actually proved. so they do have a nash equilibrium. that's not the problem. the problem is that there can be many. and then there's a question of which equilibrium to select. so, and if you select your strategy from a different equilibrium and i select mine, then what does that mean? and in these non-zero sum games, we may lose some joint benefit by being just simply stupid. we could actually both be better off if we did something else. and in three player, you get other problems also collusion. like maybe you and i can gang up on a third player and we can do radically better by colluding. so there are lots of issues that come up there. so no brown, the student you work with on this, has mentioned, i looked through the ama on reddit. he mentioned that the ability of poker players to collaborate would make the game. he was asked the question of how would you make the game of poker, or both of you were asked the question, how would you make the game of poker beyond being solvable by current ai methods? and he said that there's not many ways of making poker more difficult, but collaboration or cooperation between players would make it extremely difficult. so can you provide the intuition behind why that is, if you agree with that idea? yeah, so i've done a lot of work on coalitional games and we actually have a paper here with my other student, gabriele farina, and some other collaborators at nips on that. actually just came back from the poster session where we presented this. but so when you have a collusion, it's a different problem. and it typically gets even harder then. even the game representations, some of the game representations don't really allow good computation. so we actually introduced a new game representation for that. is that kind of cooperation part of the model? do you have information about the fact that other players are cooperating, or is it just this chaos where nothing is known? so there's some things unknown. can you give an example of a collusion type game? so bridge. so think about bridge. it's when you and i are on a team, our payoffs are the same. the problem is that we can't talk. so when i get my cards, i can't whisper to you what my cards are. that would not be allowed. so we have to somehow coordinate our strategies ahead of time, and only ahead of time. and then there's certain signals we can talk about, but they have to be such that the other team also understands them. so that's an example where the coordination is already built into the rules of the game. but in many other situations auctions or negotiations or diplomatic relationships, poker, it's not really built in, but it still can be very helpful for the colluders. i've read you write somewhere, the negotiations, you come to the table with prior, a strategy that you're willing to do and not willing to do those kinds of things. so how do you start to now moving away from poker, moving beyond poker into other applications, negotiations? how do you start applying this to other domains, even real world domains that you've worked on? yeah, i actually have two startup companies doing exactly that. one is called strategic machine, and that's for kind of business applications, gaming, sports, all sorts of things that. any applications of this to business and to sports and to gaming, to various types of things in finance, electricity markets and so on. and the other is called strategy robot, where we are taking this to military security, cybersecurity and intelligence applications. i think you worked a little bit in, how do you put it, advertisement, sort of suggesting ads kind of thing. yeah, that's another company, optimized markets, but that's much more about a combinatorial market and optimization based technology. that's not using these game theory reasoning technologies. i see. okay, so what sort of high level do you think about our ability to use game theoretic concepts to model human behavior? do you think human behavior is amenable to this kind of modeling outside of the poker games? and where have you seen it done successfully in your work? i'm not sure. the goal really is modeling humans. like for example, if i'm playing a zero-sum game, i don't really care that the opponent is actually following my model of rational behavior, because if they're not, that's even better for me. right. so see with the opponents in games, there's the prerequisite is that you formalize the interaction in some way that can be amenable to analysis. i mean, you've done this amazing work with mechanism design, designing games that have certain outcomes. but so i'll tell you an example from my world of autonomous vehicles, right? we're studying pedestrians and pedestrians and cars negotiate in this nonverbal communication. there's this weird game dance of tension where pedestrians are basically saying, i trust that you won't kill me. and so as a jaywalker, i will step onto the road, even though i'm breaking the law and there's this tension. and the question is, we really don't know how to model that well in trying to model intent. and so people sometimes bring up ideas of game theory and so on. do you think that aspect of human behavior can use these kinds of imperfect information approaches, modeling? how do you start to attack a problem that when you don't even know how to design the game to describe the situation in order to solve it? okay. so i haven't really thought about jaywalking, but one thing that i think could be a good application in autonomous vehicles is the following. so let's say that you have fleets of autonomous cars operated by different companies. so maybe here's the waymo fleet and here's the uber fleet. if you think about the rules of the road, they define certain legal rules, but that still leaves a huge strategy space open. like as a simple example, when cars merge, how humans merge, they slow down and look at each other and try to merge. wouldn't it be better if these situations would already be pre-negotiated so we can actually merge at full speed and we know that this is the situation, this is how we do it, and it's all going to be faster. but there are way too many situations to negotiate manually. so you could use automated negotiation. this is the idea at least. you could use automated negotiation to negotiate all of these situations or many of them in advance. and of course it might be that, hey, maybe you're not going to always let me go first. maybe you said, okay, well, in these situations, i'll let you go first, but in exchange, you're going to give me too much, you're going to let me go first in these situations. so it's this huge combinatorial negotiation. and do you think there's room in that example of merging to model this whole situation as an imperfect information game or do you really want to consider it to be a perfect? no, that's a good question. yeah. that's a good question. do you pay the price of assuming that you don't know everything? yeah, i don't know. it's certainly much easier. games with perfect information are much easier. so if you can get away with it, you should. but if the real situation is of imperfect information, then you're going to have to deal with imperfect information. great. so what lessons have you learned the annual computer poker competition? an incredible accomplishment of ai. you look at the history of deep blue, alphago, these kind of moments when ai stepped up in an engineering effort and a scientific effort combined to beat the best of human players. so what do you take away from this whole experience? what have you learned about designing ai systems that play these kinds of games? and what does that mean for sort of ai in general for the future of ai development? yeah. so that's a good question. so there's so much to say about it. i do this type of performance oriented research, although in my group, we go all the way from idea to theory to experiments to big system building to commercialization. so we span that spectrum. but i think that in a lot of situations in ai, you really have to build the big systems and evaluate them at scale before you know what works and doesn't. and we've seen that in the computational game theory community, that there are a lot of techniques that look good in the small, but then they cease to look good in the large. and we've also seen that there are a lot of techniques that look superior in theory. and i really mean in terms of convergence rates, better, first order methods, better convergence rates, the cfr based algorithms. yet the cfr based algorithms are the fastest in practice. so it really tells me that you have to test this in reality. the theory isn't tight enough, if you will, to tell you which algorithms are better than the others. and you have to look at these things in the large, because any sort of projections you do from the small can at least in this domain be very misleading. so that's kind of from a kind of a science and engineering perspective, from a personal perspective, it's been just a wild experience in that with the first poker competition, the first brains versus ai man machine poker competition that we organized. there had been, by the way, for other poker games, there had been previous competitions, but this was for heads up, no limit. this was the first. and i probably became the most hated person in the world of poker. and i didn't mean to... why is that? for cracking the game for something? yeah. a lot of people felt that it was a real threat to the whole game, the whole existence of the game. if ai becomes better than humans, people would be scared to play poker because there are these superhuman ais running around taking their money and all of that. so it was really aggressive. the comments were super aggressive. i got everything just short of death threats. do you think the same was true for chess? because right now they just completed the world championships in chess and humans just started ignoring the fact that there's ai systems now that outperform humans and they still enjoy the game, it's still a beautiful game. yes, that's what i think. and i think the same thing happens in poker. and so i didn't think of myself as somebody who was going to kill the game and i don't think i did. i've really learned to love this game. i wasn't a poker player before, but i learned so many nuances from these ais. and they've really changed how the game is played, by the way. so they have these very martian ways of playing poker and the top humans are now incorporating those types of strategies into their own play. so if anything, to me, our work has made poker a richer, more interesting game for humans to play, not something that is going to steer humans away from it entirely. just a quick comment on something you said, which is, if i may say so, in academia is a little bit rare sometimes. it's pretty brave to put your ideas to the test in the way you described, saying that sometimes good ideas don't work when you actually try to apply them at scale. so where does that come from? i mean, if you could do advice for people, what drives you in that sense? were you always this way? i mean, it takes a brave person, i guess is what i'm saying, to test their ideas and to see if this thing actually works against human top human players and so on. i don't know about brave, but it takes a lot of work. it takes a lot of work and a lot of time to make something big and to organize an event and stuff that. and what drives you in that effort? because you could still, i would argue, get a best paper award at nips as you did in 17 without doing this. that's right. yes. and so in general, i believe it's very important to do things in the real world and at scale. and that's really where the pudding, if you will, proof is in the pudding. that's where it is. in this particular case, it was kind of a competition between different groups for many years as to who can be the first one to beat the top humans at heads up, no limit, texas hold'em. so it became kind of a competition, who can get there? yeah. so a little friendly competition can be a can do wonders for progress. yes, absolutely. so the topic of mechanism design, which is really interesting, also kind of new to me, except as an observer of, i don't know, politics and any, i'm an observer of mechanisms, but you write in your paper and automated mechanism design that i quickly read. so mechanism design is designing the rules of the game. so you get a certain desirable outcome and you have this work on doing so in an automatic fashion as opposed to fine tuning it. so what have you learned from those efforts? if you look, say, i don't know, at a complex our political system, can we design our political system to have in an automated fashion to have outcomes that we want? can we design something traffic lights to be smart where it gets outcomes that we want? so what are the lessons that you draw from that work? yeah. so i still very much believe in the automated mechanism design direction. yes. but it's not a panacea. there are impossibility results in mechanism design, saying that there is no mechanism that accomplishes objective x in class c. so there's no way using any mechanism design tools, manual or automated, to do certain things in mechanism design. can you describe that again? so meaning it's impossible to achieve that? yeah. ends or it's unlikely? impossible. so these are not statements about human ingenuity, who might come up with something smart. these are proofs that if you want to accomplish properties x in class c, that is not doable with any mechanism. the good thing about automated mechanism design is that we're not really designing for a class. we're designing for specific settings at a time. so even if there's an impossibility result for the whole class, it just doesn't mean that all of the cases in the class are impossible. it just means that some of the cases are impossible. so we can actually carve these islands of possibility within these non-impossible classes. and we've actually done that. so one of the famous results in mechanism design is the meyerson-satette-wayte theorem by roger meyerson and mark satette-wayte from 1983. it's an impossibility of efficient trade under imperfect information. we show that you can in many settings avoid that and get efficient trade anyway. depending on how you design the game. okay. so depending how you design the game. and of course, it doesn't in any way contradict the impossibility result. the impossibility results is still there, but it just finds spots within this impossible class where in those spots you don't have the impossibility. great. sorry if i'm going a bit philosophical, but what lessons do you draw towards, i mentioned, politics or human interaction and designing mechanisms for outside of just these kinds of trading or auctioning or purely formal games or human interaction, a political system? what, how can you think it's applicable to politics or to business, to negotiations, these kinds of things, designing rules that have certain outcomes? yeah. yeah, i do think so. have you seen success that successfully done? they hasn't really, , you mean mechanism design or automated mechanism design? so mechanism design itself has had fairly limited success so far. there are certain cases, but most of the real world situations are actually not sound from a mechanism design perspective. even in those cases where they've been designed by very knowledgeable mechanism design people, the people are typically just taking some insights from the theory and applying those insights into the real world rather than applying the mechanisms directly. so one famous example of is the fcc spectrum auctions. so i've also had a small role in that and very good economists have been, excellent economists have been working on that with no game theory. yet the rules that are designed in practice there, they're such that bidding truthfully is not the best strategy. usually mechanism design, we try to make things easy for the participants. so telling the truth is the best strategy, but even in those very high stakes auctions where you have tens of billions of dollars worth of spectrum auctioned, truth telling is not the best strategy. and by the way, nobody knows even a single optimal bidding strategy for those auctions. what's the challenge of coming up with an optimal bid? because there's a lot of players and there's imperfect information. it's not so much a lot of players, but many items for sale. and these mechanisms are such that even with just two items or one item bidding truthfully wouldn't be the best strategy. if you look at the history of ai, it's marked by seminal events, alphago beating a world champion, humango player. i would put lebrados winning the heads up no limit, holdem is one of such event. and what do you think is the next such event, whether it's in your life or in the broadly ai community that you think might be out there that would surprise the world? so that's a great question. and i don't really know the answer in terms of game solving. the heads up no limit texas holden really was the one remaining widely agreed upon benchmark. so that was the big milestone. now, are there other things? yeah, certainly there are, but there is not one that the community has kind of focused on. so what could be other things? there are groups working on starcraft. there are groups working on dota 2. these are video games. yes. or you could have diplomacy or hanabi, you know, things that. these are recreational games, but none of them are really acknowledged as kind of the main next challenge problem chess or go or heads up no limit texas holden was. so i don't really know in the game solving space what is or what will be the next benchmark. i kind of hope that there will be a next benchmark because really the different groups working on the same problem really drove these application independent techniques forward very quickly over 10 years. do you think there's an open problem that excites you that you start moving away from games into real world games, say the stock market trading? yeah, so that's kind of how i am. so i am probably not going to work as hard on these recreational benchmarks. i'm doing two startups on game solving technology, strategic machine and strategy robot. and we're really interested in pushing this stuff into practice. what do you think would be really, you know, a powerful result that would be surprising? that would be, if you can say, i mean, you know, five years, 10 years from now, something that statistically you would say is not very likely, but if there's a breakthrough, what achieve? yeah, so i think that overall, we're in a very different situation in game theory than we are in, let's say, machine learning. yes. so in machine learning, it's a fairly mature technology, and it's very broadly applied and proven success in the real world. in game solving, there are almost no applications yet. we have just become superhuman, which machine learning, you could argue happened in the 90s, if not earlier, and at least on supervised learning, certain complex supervised learning applications. now, i think the next challenge problem, i know you're not asking about it this way, you're asking about the technology breakthrough, but i think the big, big breakthrough is to be able to show that, hey, maybe most of, let's say, military planning or most of business strategy will actually be done strategically using computational game theory. that's what i would to see as the next five or 10-year goal. maybe you can explain to me again, forgive me if this is an obvious question, but, you know, machine learning methods, neural networks suffer from not being transparent, not being explainable. game theoretic methods, you know, nash equilibria, do they generally, when you see the different solutions, are they, when you talk about military operations, are they, once you see the strategies, do they make sense? are they explainable or do they suffer from the same problems as neural networks do? so that's a good question. i would say a little bit yes and no. and what i mean by that is that these game theoretic strategies, let's say, nash equilibrium, it has provable properties. so it's unlike, let's say, deep learning where you kind of cross your fingers, hopefully it'll work. and then after the fact, when you have the weights, you're still crossing your fingers and i hope it will work. here, you know that the solution quality is there, this provable solution quality guarantees. now, that doesn't necessarily mean that the strategies are human understandable. that's a whole other problem. so i think that deep learning and computational game theory are in the same boat in that sense, that both are difficult to understand. but at least the game theoretic techniques, they have these guarantees of solution quality. so do you see business operations, strategic operations, even military in the future being at least the strong candidates being proposed by automated systems? do you see that? yeah, i do. i do. but that's more of a belief than a substantiated fact. depending on where you land in optimism or pessimism, that's a really, to me, that's an exciting future, especially if there's provable things in terms of optimality. so looking into the future, there's a few folks worried about the, especially you look at the game of poker, which is probably one of the last benchmarks in terms of games being solved. they worry about the future and the existential threats of artificial intelligence. so the negative impact in whatever form on society. is that something that concerns you as much or are you more optimistic about the positive impacts of ai? oh, i am much more optimistic about the positive impacts. so just in my own work, what we've done so far, we run the nationwide kidney exchange. hundreds of people are walking around alive today who wouldn't be. and it's increased employment. you have a lot of people now running kidney exchanges and at transplant centers interacting with the kidney exchange. you have extra surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, hospitals, all of that. so employment is increasing from that and the world is becoming a better place. another example is combinatorial sourcing auctions. we did 800 large scale combinatorial sourcing auctions from 2001 to 2010 in a previous startup of mine called combinenet. and we increased the supply chain efficiency on that $60 billion of spend by 12.6. so that's over $6 billion of efficiency improvement in the world. and this is not shifting value from somebody to somebody else, just efficiency improvement. like in trucking, less empty driving, so there's less waste, less carbon footprint and so on. so a huge positive impact in the near term, but sort of to stay in it for a little longer because i think game theory has a role to play here. let me actually come back on that as one thing. i think ai is also going to make the world much safer. so that's another aspect that often gets overlooked. well, let me ask this question. maybe you can speak to the safer. so i talked to max tegmark and stuart russell, who are very concerned about existential thoracic ai. and often the concern is about value misalignment. so ai systems basically working, operating towards goals that are not the same as human civilization, human beings. so it seems game theory has a role to play there to make sure the values are aligned with human beings. i don't know if that's how you think about it. if not, how do you think ai might help with this problem? how do you think ai might make the world safer? yeah, i think this value misalignment is a fairly theoretical worry. and i haven't really seen it in it because i do a lot of real applications. i don't see it anywhere. the closest i've seen it was the following type of mental exercise, really, where i had this argument in the late 80s when we were building these transportation optimization systems. and somebody had heard that it's a good idea to have high utilization of assets. so they told me, hey, why don't you put that as an objective? and we didn't even put it as an objective, because i just showed him that if you had that as your objective, the solution would be to load your trucks full and drive in circles. nothing would ever get delivered. you'd have 100 utilization. so yeah, i know this phenomenon. i've known this for over 30 years, but i've never seen it actually be a problem in reality. and yes, if you have the wrong objective, the ai will optimize that to the hilt. and it's going to hurt more than some human who's trying to solve it in a half-baked way with some human insight, too. but i just haven't seen that materialized in practice. there's this gap that you've actually put your finger on very clearly just now between theory and reality that's very difficult to put into words, i think. it's what you can theoretically imagine, the worst possible case or even, yeah, i mean, bad cases and what usually happens in reality. so for example, to me, maybe it's something you can comment on. i grew up in the soviet union. there's currently 10,000 nuclear weapons in the world. and for many decades, it's theoretically surprising to me that the nuclear war is not broken out. do you think about this aspect from a game theoretic perspective in general? why is that true? why in theory, you could see how things would go terribly wrong and somehow yet, they have not? yeah. how do you think about that? so i do think about that a lot. i think the biggest two threats that we're facing as mankind, one is climate change and the other is nuclear war. so those are my main two worries that i worry about. and i've tried to do something about climate. i thought about trying to do something for climate change twice. actually, for two of my startups, i've actually commissioned studies of what we could do on those things. and we didn't really find a sweet spot, but i'm still keeping an eye out on that. if there's something where we could actually provide a market solution or optimization solution or some other technology solution to problems. right now, for example, pollution credit markets was what we were looking at then. and it was much more the lack of political will by those markets were not so successful rather than bad market design. so i could go in and make a better market design, but that wouldn't really move the needle on the world very much if there's no political will. and in the us, the market, at least the chicago market was just shut down and so on. so then it doesn't really help how great your market design was. and then your nuclear side, it's more, it's more, so global warming is a more encroaching problem. nuclear weapons have been here. it's an obvious problem that's just been sitting there. so how do you think about what is the mechanism of design there that just made everything seem stable? and are you still extremely worried? i am still extremely worried. so you probably know the simple game theory of mad. so this was a mutually assured destruction and it doesn't require any computation with small matrices. you can actually convince yourself that the game is such that nobody wants to initiate. yeah, that's a very coarse grained analysis. and it really works in a situational way. you have two superpowers or small number of superpowers. now things are very different. you have a smaller nooks. so the threshold of initiating is smaller and you have smaller countries and non-nation actors who may get nooks and so on. so i think it's riskier now than it was maybe ever before. and what idea application of ai, you've talked about a little bit, but what is the most exciting to you right now? i mean, you're here at nips, neurips now, you have a few excellent pieces of work, but what are you thinking into the future with several companies you're doing? what's the most exciting thing or one of the exciting things? the number one thing for me right now is coming up with these scalable techniques for game solving and applying them into the real world. i'm still very interested in market design as well. and we're doing that in the optimized markets, but i'm most interested if number one right now is strategic machine strategy robot getting that technology out there and seeing as you're in the trenches doing applications, what needs to be actually filled, what technology gaps still need to be filled. so it's so hard to just put your feet on the table and imagine what needs to be done. but when you're actually doing real applications, the applications tell you what needs to be done. and i really enjoy that interaction. is it a challenging process to apply some of the state of the art techniques you're working on and having the various players in industry or the military or people who could really benefit from it actually use it? what's that process of, you know, in autonomous vehicles will work with automotive companies and they're in many ways are a little bit old fashioned, it's difficult. they really want to use this technology, this clearly will have a significant benefit, but the systems aren't quite in place to easily have them integrated in terms of data, in terms of compute, in terms of all these kinds of things. so is that one of the bigger challenges that you're facing and how do you tackle that challenge? yeah, i think that's always a challenge. that's kind of slowness and inertia really, of let's do things the way we've always done it. you just have to find the internal champions that the customer who understand that, hey, things can't be the same way in the future. otherwise, bad things are going to happen. and it's in autonomous vehicles, it's actually very interesting that the car makers are doing that, then they're very traditional. but at the same time, you have tech companies who have nothing to do with cars or transportation, google and baidu really pushing on autonomous cars. i find that fascinating. clearly, you're super excited about actually these ideas having an impact in the world. in terms of the technology, in terms of ideas and research, are there directions that you're also excited about? whether that's on the some of the approaches you talked about for the imperfect information games, whether it's applying deep learning to some of these problems, is there something that you're excited in the research side of things? yeah, lots of different things in the game solving. solving even bigger games, games where you have more hidden action of the player actions as well. poker is a game where really the chance actions are hidden, or some of them are hidden, but the player actions are public. multiplayer games of various sorts, collusion, opponent exploitation, and even longer games. some games that basically go forever, but they're not repeated. so, see extensive form games that go forever. what would that even look ? how do you represent that? how do you solve that? what's an example of a game that? are these some of the stochastic games that you mentioned? let's say business strategy. and not just modeling a particular interaction, but thinking about the business from here to eternity. or let's say military strategy. so, it's not war is going to go away. how do you think about military strategy that's going to go forever? how do you even model that? how do you know whether a move was good that somebody made? and so on. so, that's kind of one direction. i'm also very interested in learning much more scalable techniques for integer programming. so, we had an icml paper this summer on that. the first automated algorithm configuration paper that has theoretical generalization guarantees. so, if i see this many training examples and i tool my algorithm in this way, it's going to have good performance on the real distribution, which i've not seen. so, which is kind of interesting that algorithm configuration has been going on now for at least 17 years seriously. and there has not been any generalization theory before. well, this is really exciting. and it's a huge honor to talk to you. thank you so much tomas. thank you for bringing lebron to the world and all the great work you're doing. well, thank you very much. it's been fun. good questions.","completion":"spoken"}

{"prompt":"the following is a conversation with jack dorsey, co-founder and ceo of twitter and founder and ceo of square. given the happenings at the time related to twitter leadership and the very limited time we had, we decided to focus this conversation on square and some broader philosophical topics and to save an in-depth conversation on engineering and ai at twitter for a second appearance on this podcast. this conversation was recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic. for everyone feeling the medical, psychological and financial burden of this crisis, i'm sending love your way. stay strong. we're in this together. we'll beat this thing. as an aside, let me mention that jack moved $1 billion of square equity, which is 28 of his wealth, to form an organization that funds covid-19 relief. first, as andrew yang tweeted, this is a spectacular commitment. and second, it is amazing that it operates transparently by posting all its donations to a single google doc. to me, true transparency is simple. and this is as simple as it gets. this is the artificial intelligence podcast. if you enjoy it, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcasts, support it on patreon, or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman, spelled f-r-i-d-m-a-n. as usual, i'll do a few minutes of ads now and never any ads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation. i hope that works for you and doesn't hurt the listening experience. this show is presented by masterclass. sign up on slash lex to get a discount and to support this podcast. when i first heard about masterclass, i thought it was too good to be true. for $180 a year, you get an all access pass to watch courses from, to list some of my favorites. chris hadfield on space exploration, neil degrasse tyson on scientific thinking and communication, will wright, creator of simcity, and sims, both one of my favorite games on game design, jane goodall on conservation, carlos santana on guitar, one of my favorite guitar players, gary kasparov on chess, daniel nagrano on poker, and many, many more. chris hadfield explaining how rockets work and the experience of being launched into space alone is worth the money. for me, the key is to not be overwhelmed by the abundance of choice. pick three courses you want to complete, watch each all the way through. it's not that long, but it's an experience that will stick with you for a long time. it's easily worth the money. you can watch it on basically any device. once again, sign up on slash lex to get a discount and to support this podcast. and now here's my conversation with jack dorsey. you've been on several podcasts, joe rogan, sam harris, rich roll, others, excellent conversations. but i think there's several topics that you didn't talk about that i think are fascinating that i love to talk to you about. sort of machine learning, artificial intelligence, both the narrow kind and the general kind and engineering at scale. so there's a lot of incredible engineering going on that you're part of crypto, cryptocurrency, blockchain, ubi, all kinds of philosophical questions maybe we'll get to about life and death and meaning and beauty. so you're involved in building some of the biggest network systems in the world, sort of trillions of interactions a day. the cool thing about that is the infrastructure, the engineering at scale. you started as a programmer with c building. yeah, so. i'm a hacker, i'm not really an engineer. not a legit software engineer, you're a hacker at heart. but to achieve scale, you have to do some unfortunately legit large scale engineering. so how do you make that magic happen? hire people that i can learn from, number one. i mean, i'm a hacker in the sense that i, my approach has always been do whatever it takes to make it work so that i can see and feel the thing and then learn what needs to come next. and oftentimes what needs to come next is a matter of being able to bring it to more people, which is scale. and there's a lot of great people out there that either have experience or are extremely fast learners that we've been lucky enough to find and work with for years. but i think a lot of it, we benefit a ton from the open source community and just all the learnings there that are laid bare in the open. all the mistakes, all the success, all the problems. it's a very slow moving process usually open source, but it's very deliberate. and you get to see because of the pace, you get to see what it takes to really build something meaningful. so i learned most of everything i learned about hacking and programming and engineering has been due to open source and the generosity that people have given to give up their time, sacrifice their time without any expectation in return other than being a part of something much larger than themselves, which i think is great. the open source movement is amazing. but if you just look at the scale, square has to take care of, is this fundamentally a software problem or hardware problem? you mentioned hiring a bunch of people, but it's not maybe from our perspective, not often talked about how incredible that is to sort of have a system that doesn't go down often, that is secure, is able to take care of all these transactions. like maybe i'm also a hacker at heart and it's incredible to me that that kind of scale could be achieved. is there some insight, some lessons, some interesting tidbits that you can say about how to make that scale happen? is it the hardware fundamentally challenge? is it a software challenge? is it , is it a social challenge of building large teams of engineers that work together, that kind of thing? like what's the interesting challenges there? by the way, you're the best stress hacker i've met. i think the- thank you, by the way. thank you. if the enumeration you just went through, i don't think there's one, you have to kind of focus on all and the ability to focus on all that really comes down to how you face problems and whether you can break them down into parts that you can focus on. because i think the biggest mistake is trying to solve or address too many at once, or not going deep enough with the questions or not being critical of the answers you find, or not taking the time to form credible hypotheses that you can actually test and you can see the results of. so all of those fall in the face of ultimately critical thinking skills, problem solving skills. and if there's one skill i wanna improve every day, it's that, that's what contributes to learning and the only way we can evolve any of these things is learning what it's currently doing and how to take it to the next step. and questioning assumptions, the first principles kind of thinking seems fundamental to this whole process. yeah, but if you get too overextended into, well, this is a hardware issue, you miss all the software solutions. and vice versa, if you focus too much on the software, there are hardware solutions that can 10x the thing. so i try to resist the categories of thinking and look for the underlying systems that make all these things work. but those only emerge when you have a skill around creative thinking, problem solving, and being able to ask critical questions and having the patience to go deep. so one of the amazing things, if you look at the mission of square, is to increase people's access to the economy. maybe you can correct me if i'm wrong, that's from my perspective. so from the perspective of merchants, peer-to-peer payments, even crypto, cryptocurrency, digital cryptocurrency, what do you see as the major ways our society can increase participation in the economy? so if we look at today and the next 10 years, next 20 years, you go into africa, maybe in africa, and all kinds of other places outside of north america. if there was one word that i think represents what we're trying to do at square, it is that word access. one of the things we found is that we weren't expecting this at all. when we started, we thought we were just building a piece of hardware to enable people to plug it into their phone and swipe a credit card. and then as we talked with people who actually tried to accept credit cards in the past, we found a consistent theme, which many of them weren't even enabled, and enabled but allowed to process credit cards. and we dug a little bit deeper, again, asking that question. and we found that a lot of them would go to banks or these merchant acquirers, and waiting for them was a credit check and looking at a fica score. and many of the businesses that we talked to and many small businesses, they don't have good credit or a credit history. they're entrepreneurs who are just getting started, taking a lot of personal risk, financial risk. and it just felt ridiculous to us that for the job of being able to accept money from people, you had to get your credit checked. and as we dug deeper, we realized that that wasn't the intention of the financial industry, but it's the only tool they had available to them to understand authenticity, intent, predictor of future behavior. so that's the first thing we actually looked at. and that's where the, we built the hardware, but the software really came in in terms of risk modeling. and that's when we started down the path that eventually leads to ai. we started with a very strong data science discipline because we knew that our business was not necessarily about making hardware, it was more about enabling more people to come into the system. so the fundamental challenge there is, so to enable more people to come into the system, you have to lower the barrier of checking that that person will be a legitimate vendor. is that the fundamental problem here? yeah, and a different mindset. i think a lot of the financial industry had a mindset of kind of distrust and just constantly looking for opportunities to prove why people shouldn't get into the system, whereas we took on a mindset of trust and then verify, verify, verify, verify, verify. so we moved, when we entered the space, only about 30 to 40 of the people who applied to accept credit cards would actually get through the system. we took that number and we moved to the system. credit cards would actually get through the system. we took that number to 99. and that's because we reframed the problem. we built credible models and we had this mindset of we're going to watch not at the merchant level, but we're gonna watch at the transaction level. so come in, perform some transactions, and as long as you're doing things that feel high integrity, credible, and don't look suspicious, we'll continue to serve you. if we see any interestingness in how you use our system, that will be bubbled up to people to review, to figure out if there's something nefarious going on, and that's when we might ask you to leave. so the change in the mindset led to the technology that we needed to enable more people to get through and to enable more people to access the system. what role does machine learning play in that context? you said, first of all, that's a beautiful shift. anytime you shift your viewpoint into seeing that people are fundamentally good, and then you just have to verify and catch the ones who are not, as opposed to assuming everybody's bad, this is a beautiful thing. so what role does the, do you, throughout the history of the company, has machine learning played in doing that verification? it was immediate. i mean, we weren't calling it machine learning, but it was data science. and then as the industry evolved, machine learning became more of the nomenclature, and as that evolved, it became more sophisticated with deep learning, and as that continues to evolve, it'll be another thing. but they're all in the same vein. but we built that discipline up within the first year of the company. because we also had, we had to partner with the bank, we had to partner with visa mastercard, and we had to show that by bringing more people into the system, that we could do so in a responsible way that would not compromise their systems and that they would trust us. how do you convince this upstart company with some cool machine learning tricks is able to deliver on this sort of trustworthy set of merchants? we staged it out in tiers. we had a bucket of 500 people using it, and then we showed results, and then 1,000, and then 10,000, and then 50,000, and then the constraint was lifted. so again, it's kind of, getting something tangible out there. i wanna show what we can do rather than talk about it. and that put a lot of pressure on us to do the right things. and it also created a culture of accountability, of a little bit more transparency, and i think incentivized all of our early folks and the company in the right way. so what does the future look in terms of increasing people's access? or if you look at iot, internet of things, there's more and more intelligent devices. you can see there's some people even talking about our personal data as a thing that we could monetize more explicitly versus implicitly. sort of everything can become part of the economy. do you see, so what does the future of square look in sort of giving people access in all kinds of ways to being part of the economy as merchants and as consumers? i believe that the currency we use is a huge part of the answer. and i believe that the internet deserves and requires a native currency. and that's why i'm such a huge believer in bitcoin, because it just, our biggest problem as a company right now is we cannot act an internet company. open a new market, we have to have a partnership with a local bank. we have to pay attention to different regulatory onboarding environments. and a digital currency bitcoin takes a bunch of that away where we can potentially launch a product in every single market around the world because they're all using the same currency. and we have consistent understanding of regulation and onboarding and what that means. so i think the internet continuing to be accessible to people is number one. and then i think currency is number two. and it will just allow for a lot more innovation, a lot more speed in terms of what we can build and others can build. and it's just really exciting. so i mean, i wanna be able to see that and feel that in my lifetime. so in this aspect and in other aspects, you have a deep interest in cryptocurrency and distributed ledger tech in general. i talked to vitalik buterin yesterday on this podcast. he says hi, by the way. hey. he's a brilliant, brilliant person. talked a lot about bitcoin and ethereum, of course. so can you maybe linger on this point? what do you find appealing about bitcoin, about digital currency? where do you see it going in the next 10, 20 years? and what are some of the challenges with respect to square, but also just bigger for our globally, for our world, for the way we think about money? i think the most beautiful thing about it is there's no one person setting the direction. and there's no one person on the other side that can stop it. so we have something that is pretty organic in nature and very principled in its original design. and i think the bitcoin white paper is one of the most seminal works of computer science in the last 20, 30 years. it's poetry. i mean, it really is. it's pretty cool technology. i mean, that's not often talked about. sort of there's so much sort of hype around digital currency about the financial impacts of it, the natural impacts of it, but the actual technology is quite beautiful from a computer science perspective. yeah, and the underlying principles behind it that went into it, even to the point of releasing it under a pseudonym. i think that's a very, very powerful statement. the timing of when it was released is powerful. it was a total activist move. i mean, it's moving the world forward in a way that i think is extremely noble and honorable and enables everyone to be part of the story, which is also really cool. so you asked the question around 10 years and 20 years. i mean, i think the amazing thing is no one knows. and it can emerge and every person that comes into the ecosystem, whether they be a developer or someone who uses it, can change its direction in small and large ways. and that's what i think it should be because that's what the internet has shown is possible. now there's complications with that, of course. and there's certainly companies that own large parts of the internet and can direct it more than others. and there's not equal access to every single person in the world just yet. but all those problems are visible enough to speak about them. and to me, that gives confidence that they're solvable in a relatively short timeframe. i think the world is moving forward and i think the world changes a lot as we get these satellites projecting the internet down to earth, because it just removes a bunch of the former constraints and really levels the playing field. but a global currency, which a native currency for the internet is a proxy for, is a very powerful concept. and i don't think any one person on this planet truly understands the ramifications of that. i think there's a lot of positives to it. there's some negatives as well. but i think it's possible, sorry to interrupt, do you think it's possible that this kind of digital currency would redefine the nature of money to become the main currency of the world as opposed to being tied to fiat currency of different nations and sort of really push the decentralization of control of money? definitely, but i think the bigger ramification is how it affects how society works. and i think there are many positive ramifications outside of just money. outside of just money. money is a foundational layer that enables so much more. i was meeting with an entrepreneur in ethiopia and payments is probably the number one problem to solve across the continent, both in terms of moving money across borders between nations on the continent or the amount of corruption within the current system. but the lack of easy ways to pay people makes starting anything really difficult. i met an entrepreneur who started the lyft slash uber of ethiopia and one of the biggest problems she has is that it's not easy for her writers to pay the company and it's not easy for her to pay the drivers. and that definitely has stunted her growth and made everything more challenging. so the fact that she even has to think about payments instead of thinking about the best writer experience and the best driver experience is pretty telling. so i think as we get a more durable, resilient and global standard, we see a lot more innovation everywhere. and i think there's no better case study for this than the various countries within africa and their entrepreneurs who are trying to start things within health or sustainability or transportation or a lot of the companies that we've seen here. so the majority of companies i met in november when i spent a month on the continent were payments oriented. you mentioned, and this is a small tangent, you mentioned the anonymous launch of bitcoin is a sort of profound philosophical statement. pseudonymous. what's that even mean? there's a pseudonym. first of all, let me ask. there's an identity tied to it. it's not just anonymous, it's nakamoto. so nakamoto might represent one person or multiple people. but. let me ask, are you satoshi nakamoto? just checking. no, and if i were, what would i tell you? yeah, that's true. but. maybe you slip. a pseudonym is constructed identity. anonymity is just kind of this random, drop something off and leave. there's no intention to build an identity around it. and while the identity being built was a short time window, it was meant to stick around, i think, and to be known. and it's being honored in, you know, how the community thinks about building it. like the concept of satoshi's, for instance, is one such example. but i think it was smart not to do it anonymous, not to do it as a real identity, but to do it as pseudonym, because i think it builds tangibility and a little bit of empathy that this was a human or a set of humans behind it. and there's this natural identity that i can imagine. but there is also a sacrifice of ego. that's a pretty powerful thing from the perspective. yeah, which is beautiful. would you do, sort of philosophically, to ask you the question, would you do all the same things you're doing now if your name wasn't attached to it? sort of if you had to sacrifice the ego? put another way, is your ego deeply tied in the decisions you've been making? i hope not. i mean, i believe i would certainly attempt to do the things without my name having to be attached with it. but it's hard to do that in a corporation legally. that's the issue. if i were to do more open source things, then absolutely. like i don't need my particular identity, my real identity associated with it. but i think the appreciation that comes from doing something good and being able to see it and see people use it is pretty overwhelming and powerful, more so than maybe seeing your name in the headlines. let's talk about artificial intelligence a little bit, if we could. 70 years ago, alan turing formulated the turing test. to me, natural language is one of the most interesting spaces of problems that are tackled by artificial intelligence. it's the canonical problem of what it means to be intelligent. he formulated it as the turing test. let me ask sort of the broad question. how hard do you think is it to pass the turing test in the space of language? just from a very practical standpoint, i think where we are now and for at least years out is one where the artificial intelligence, machine learning, the deep learning models can bubble up interestingness very, very quickly and pair that with human discretion around severity, around depth, around nuance and meaning. i think for me, the chasm across for general intelligence is to be able to explain why and the meaning behind something. behind a decision? so being able to tell stories. behind a decision or a set of data. so the explainability part is kind of essential to be able to explain using natural language why the decisions were made, that kind of thing. yeah, i mean, i think that's one of our biggest risks in artificial intelligence going forward is we are building a lot of black boxes that can't necessarily explain why they made a decision or what criteria they used to make the decision. and we're trusting them more and more from lending decisions to content recommendation, to driving, to health. like a lot of us have watches that tell us to understand. how was it deciding that? i mean, that one's pretty simple. but you can imagine how complex they get. and being able to explain the reasoning behind some of those recommendations seems to be an essential part. although it's hard. which is a very hard problem because sometimes even we can't explain why we make decisions. that's what i was, i think we're being sometimes a little bit unfair to artificial intelligence systems because we're not very good at some of these things. do you think, apologize for the ridiculous romanticized question, but on that line of thought, do you think we'll ever be able to build a system in the movie her that you could fall in love with? so have that kind of deep connection with. hasn't that already happened? hasn't someone in japan fallen in love with his ai? there's always going to be somebody that does that kind of thing. i mean, at a much larger scale of actually building relationships, of being deeper connections. it doesn't have to be love, but it just deeper connections with artificial intelligence systems. so you mentioned explainability. that's less a function of the artificial intelligence and more a function of the individual and how they find meaning and where they find meaning. do you think we humans can find meaning in technology in this kind of way? yeah, yeah, 100. and i don't necessarily think it's a negative, but it's constantly going to evolve. so i don't know, but meaning is something that's entirely subjective. and i don't think it's going to be a function of finding the magic algorithm that enables everyone to love it. but maybe, i don't know. that question really gets at the difference between human and machine. you had a little bit of an exchange with elon musk. basically, i mean, it's a trivial version of that, but i think there's a more fundamental question of is it possible to tell the difference between a bot and a human? and do you think it's, if we look into the future, 10, 20 years out, do you think it would be possible or is it even necessary to tell the difference in the digital space between a human and a robot? can we have fulfilling relationships with each or do we need to tell the difference between them? i think it's certainly useful in certain problem domains to be able to tell the difference. and i think in others, it might not be as useful. i think it's possible for us today to tell that difference. it's the reverse, the meta of the turing test. well, what's interesting is i think the technology to create is moving much faster than the technology to detect. do you think so? so if you look at adversarial machine learning, there's a lot of systems that try to fool machine learning systems. and at least for me, the hope is that the technology to defend will always be right there, at least. your sense is that... i don't know if they'll be right there. i mean, it's a race, right? so the detection technologies have to be two or 10 steps ahead of the creation technologies. this is a problem that i think the financial industry will face more and more because a lot of our risk models, for instance, are built around identity. payments ultimately comes down to identity. and you can imagine a world where all this conversation around deep fakes goes towards the direction of driver's license or passports or state identities. and people construct identities in order to get through a system such as ours to start accepting credit cards or into the cash app. and those technologies seem to be moving very, very quickly. our ability to detect them, i think, is probably lagging at this point, but certainly with more focus, we can get ahead of it. but this is gonna touch everything. so i think it's security. we're never going to be able to build a perfect detection system. we're only going to be able to, what we should be focused on is the speed of evolving it and being able to take signals that show correctness or errors as quickly as possible and move and to be able to build that into our newer models or the self-learning models. do you have other worries, some people, elon and others have worries of existential threats of artificial intelligence, of artificial general intelligence, or if you think more narrowly about threats and concerns about more narrow artificial intelligence, what are your thoughts in this domain? do you have concerns or are you more optimistic? i think yuval, in his book 21 lessons for the 21st century, his last chapter is around meditation. and you look at the title of the chapter and you're , , it's all meditation. but what was interesting about that chapter is he believes that kids being born today, growing up today, google has a stronger sense of their preferences than they do, which you can easily imagine. i can easily imagine today that google probably knows my preferences more than my mother does, maybe not me per se, but for someone growing up only knowing the internet, only knowing what google is capable of, or facebook, or twitter, or square, or any of these things, the self-awareness is being offloaded to other systems and particularly these algorithms. and his concern is that we lose that self-awareness because the self-awareness is now outside of us and it's doing such a better job at helping us direct our decisions around, should i stand? should i walk today? what doctor should i choose? who should i date? all these things we're now seeing play out very quickly. so he sees meditation as a tool to build that self-awareness and to bring the focus back on, why do i make these decisions? why do i react in this way? why did i have this thought? where did that come from? that's a way to regain control. or awareness, maybe not control, but awareness so that you can be aware that yes, i am offloading this decision to this algorithm that i don't fully understand and can't tell me why it's doing the things it's doing because it's so complex. that's not to say that the algorithm can't be a good thing. and to me, recommender systems, the best of what they can do is to help guide you on a journey of learning new ideas of learning period. it can be a great thing, but do you know you're doing that? are you aware that you're inviting it to do that to you? i think that's the risk he identifies. that's perfectly okay. but are you aware that you have that invitation and it's being acted upon? and so that's a concern. you're kind of highlighting that without a lack of awareness, you can just be floating at sea. so awareness is key in the future of these artificial intelligence systems. the other movie, wall-e, which i think is one of pixar's best movies besides ratatouille. ratatouille was incredible. you had me until ratatouille, okay. ratatouille was incredible. all right, we've come to the first point where we disagree. okay. it's the entrepreneurial story in the form of a rat. i just remember just the soundtrack was really good. excellent. what are your thoughts sticking on artificial intelligence a little bit about the displacement of jobs? that's another perspective that candidates andrew yang talk about. yang gang forever. yang gang. so he unfortunately, speaking of yang gang, has recently dropped out. i know, it was very disappointing and depressing. yeah, but on the positive side, he's i think launching a podcast. so- really? cool. yeah, he just announced that. i'm sure he'll try to talk you into trying to come onto the podcast. i would love to. what about ratatouille? yeah, maybe he'll be more welcoming of the ratatouille argument. what are your thoughts on his concerns of the displacement of jobs, of automation? of course, there's positive impacts that could come from automation and ai, but there could also be negative impacts. and within that framework, what are your thoughts about universal basic income? so these interesting new ideas of how we can empower people in the economy. i think he was 100 right on almost every dimension. we see this in square's business. i mean, he identified truck drivers from missouri, and he certainly pointed to the concern and the issue that people from where i'm from feel every single day that is often invisible and not talked about enough. you know, the next big one is cashiers. this is where it pertains to square's business. we are seeing more and more of the point of sale move to the individual customer's hand in the form of their phone and apps and pre-order and order ahead. we're seeing more kiosks. we're seeing more things amazon go. and the number of workers as a cashier in retail is immense. and there's no real answers on how they transform their skills and work into something else. and i think that does lead to a lot of really negative ramifications. and the important point that he brought up around universal basic income is given that the shift is going to come and given it is going to take time to set people up with new skills and new careers, they need to have a floor to be able to survive. and this $1,000 a month is such a floor. it's not going to incentivize you to quit your job because it's not enough, but it will enable you to not have to worry as much about just getting on day to day so that you can focus on what am i going to do now and what skills do i need to acquire? and i think a lot of people point to the fact that during the industrial age, we had the same concerns around automation, factory lines and everything worked out okay. but the biggest change is just the velocity and the centralization of a lot of the things that make this work, which is the data and the algorithms that work on this data. i think the second biggest scary thing is just around ai is just who actually owns the data and who can operate on it. and are we able to share the insights from the data so that we can also build algorithms that help our needs or help our business or whatnot? so that's where i think regulation could play a strong and positive part. first, looking at the primitives of ai and the tools we use to build these services that will ultimately touch every single aspect of the human experience. and then where data is owned and how it's shared. so those are the answers that as a society, as a world, we need to have better answers around, which we're currently not. they're just way too centralized into a few very, very large companies. but i think it was spot on with identifying the problem and proposing solutions that would actually work. at least that we'd learned from them, you could expand or evolve, but it's not a big deal. it's not a big deal to expand or evolve. but i mean, i think ubi is well past its due. it was certainly trumpeted by martin luther king and even before him as well. and you said, the exact thousand dollar mark might not be the correct one, but you should take the steps to try to implement these solutions and see what works. 100. and i've had similar diets, at least i was. the first time i've heard this. yeah, so i was doing it. first time anyone has said that to me in this case. yeah, but it's becoming more and more cool. but i was doing it before it was cool. so intermittent fasting and fasting in general, i really enjoy, i love food, but i enjoy the, i also love suffering because i'm russian. so fasting kind of makes you appreciate the, makes you appreciate what it is to be human somehow. so, but i have, outside the philosophical stuff, i have a more specific question. it also helps me as a programmer and a deep thinker, from the scientific perspective, to sit there for many hours and focus deeply. maybe you were a hacker before you were ceo. what have you learned about diet, lifestyle, mindset that helps you maximize mental performance, to be able to focus for, to think deeply in this world of distractions? i think i just took it for granted for too long. which aspect? just the social structure of we eat three meals a day and there's snacks in between. and i just never really asked the question why. oh, by the way, in case people don't know, i think a lot of people know, but you at least, you famously eat once a day. you still eat once a day? yep, i eat dinner. by the way, what made you decide to eat once a day? because to me, that was a huge revolution, that you don't have to eat breakfast. that was , i felt i was a rebel. like i abandoned my parents or something and became an anarchist. when you first, the first week you start doing it, it feels you kind of have a superpower. then you realize it's not really a superpower. but i think you realize, at least i realized it just how much our minds dictates what we're possible with. and sometimes we have structures around us that incentivize this three meal a day thing, which was purely social structure versus necessity for our health and for our bodies. and i did it just, i started doing it because i played a lot with my diet when i was a kid and i was vegan for two years and just went all over the place. just because i, you know, health is the most precious thing we have and none of us really understand it. so being able to ask the question through experiments that i can perform on myself and learn about is compelling to me. and i heard this one guy on a podcast, wim hof, who's famous for doing ice baths and holding his breath and all these things. he said he only eats one meal a day. i'm , wow, that sounds super challenging and uncomfortable. i'm gonna do it. so i just, i learned the most when i make myself, i wouldn't say suffer, but when i make myself feel uncomfortable because everything comes to bear in those moments and you really learn what you're about or what you're not. so i've been doing that my whole life. like when i was a kid, i could not, i was, i could not speak. like i had to go to a speech therapist and it made me extremely shy. and then one day i realized i can't keep doing this and i signed up for the speech club and it was the most uncomfortable thing i could imagine doing, getting a topic on a note card, having five minutes to write a speech about whatever that topic is, not being able to use the note card while speaking and speaking for five minutes about that topic. so, but it just, it puts so much, it gave me so much perspective around the power of communication, around my own deficiencies and around if i set my mind to do something, i'll do it. so it gave me a lot more confidence. so i see fasting in the same light. this is something that was interesting, challenging, uncomfortable, and has given me so much learning and benefit as a result. and it will lead to other things that i'll experiment with and play with. but yeah, it does feel a little bit a superpower sometimes. the most boring superpower one can imagine. no, it's quite incredible. the clarity of mind is pretty interesting. speaking of suffering, you kind of talk about facing difficult ideas. you meditate, you think about the broad context of life, of our society. let me ask sort of, apologize again for the romanticized question, but do you ponder your own mortality? do you think about death, about the finiteness of human existence when you meditate, when you think about it? and if you do, how do you make sense of it, that this thing ends? well, i don't try to make sense of it. i do think about it every day. i mean, it's a daily, multiple times a day. are you afraid of death? no, i'm not afraid of it. i think it's a transformation. i don't know to what, but it's also a tool to feel the importance of every moment. so i just use as a reminder, i have an hour. is this really what i'm going to spend the hour doing? i only have so many more sunsets and sunrises to watch. i'm not going to get up for it. i'm not going to make sure that i try to see it. so it just puts a lot into perspective and it helps me prioritize. i think it's, i don't see it as something that's , that i dread or is dreadful. it's a tool that is available to every single person to use every day because it shows how precious life is. and there's reminders every single day, whether it be your own health or a friend or a coworker or something you see in the news. so to me, it's just a question of what we do with our daily reminder. and for me, it's, am i really focused on what matters? and sometimes that might be work. sometimes that might be friendships or family or relationships or whatnot, but that's, it's the ultimate clarifier in that sense. so on the question of what matters, another ridiculously big question of once you try to make sense of it, what do you think is the meaning of it all? the meaning of life? what gives you purpose, happiness, meaning? a lot does. i mean, just being able to be aware of the fact that i'm alive is pretty meaningful. the connections i feel with individuals, whether they're people i just meet or long lasting friendships or my family is meaningful. seeing people use something that i helped build is really meaningful and powerful to me. but that sense of, i mean, i think ultimately it comes down to a sense of connection and just feeling i am bigger. i am part of something that's bigger than myself and i can feel it directly in small ways or large ways, however it manifests is probably it. last question, do you think we're living in a simulation? i don't know, it's a pretty fun one if we are, but also crazy and random and brought with tons of problems. but yeah. would you have it any other way? yeah. i mean, i just think it's taken us way too long as a planet to realize we're all in this together and we all are connected in very significant ways. i think we hide our connectivity very well through ego, through whatever it is of the day, but that is the one thing i would wanna work towards changing and that's how i would have it another way. cause if we can't do that, then how are we gonna connect to all the other simulations? cause that's the next step is , what's happening in the other simulation. escaping this one and yeah. spanning across the multiple simulations and sharing it and on the fun. i don't think there's a better way to end it. jack, thank you so much for all the work you do. there's probably other ways that we've ended this and other simulations that may have been better. we'll have to wait and see. thanks so much for talking to me. thank you. thanks for listening to this conversation with jack dorsey and thank you to our sponsor, masterclass. please consider supporting this podcast by signing up to masterclass at slash lex. if you enjoy this podcast, subscribe on youtube, review it with five stars on apple podcast, support on patreon or simply connect with me on twitter at lex friedman. and now let me leave you with some words about bitcoin from paul graham. i'm very intrigued by bitcoin. it has all the signs of a paradigm shift. hackers love it yet it is described as a toy just micro computers. thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.","completion":"spoken"}
{"prompt":"1. basics (genre, premise, key takeaways) seafaring women adventures of pirate queens, female stowaways, and sailors' wives is a historical narrative that explores the often overlooked role of women in maritime history. the book delves into the stories of pirate queens, female stowaways, and sailors' wives, challenging the traditional view of the sea as a male domain. the premise of the book is to shed light on the experiences and contributions of women in the world of seafaring. it aims to break down gender stereotypes and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the maritime past. key takeaways from the book include - women have played significant roles in maritime history, from piracy to sailing as stowaways. - the sea has been a source of adventure, freedom, and empowerment for many women throughout history. - the stories of these women challenge traditional gender norms and offer valuable insights into the lives of those who dared to defy societal expectations. 2. characters or key figures some of the key figures in the book include - anne bonny a pirate queen who sailed the caribbean seas in the early 18th century. - mary read another pirate queen who disguised herself as a man to join the crew of calico jack rackham. - ellen macarthur a british sailor who became the fastest solo sailor to circumnavigate the globe. - elizabeth black betty thayres a female stowaway who traveled aboard a whaling ship in the mid-19th century. these women represent a diverse range of experiences and backgrounds, yet they all share a common thread their determination to break free from societal constraints and make their mark on the world. 3. major themes (ideas, arguments, approaches, solutions) the major themes of the book align with christian doctrine in several ways. for instance, the theme of courage and determination can be seen as a reflection of faith, as these women faced immense challenges and obstacles in their pursuit of freedom and adventure. additionally, the theme of overcoming adversity through resilience and perseverance is consistent with christian teachings about the power of faith and prayer. however, there are also conflicts between the book's themes and christian doctrine. for example, the theme of piracy and criminal activity may conflict with christian teachings about morality and ethics. similarly, the theme of sexual liberation and autonomy may challenge traditional christian views on modesty and gender roles. 4. top 5 helpful advices from the book 1. embrace your passions and pursue your dreams, regardless of societal expectations. 2. be courageous and determined in the face of adversity. 3. learn from the experiences of others, particularly those who have overcome similar challenges. 4. develop a strong sense of self and stand up for your beliefs, even when they go against the grain. 5. find strength in community and support from -minded individuals. these pieces of advice are helpful for readers because they encourage personal growth, resilience, and self-discovery. they also provide practical guidance for navigating challenges and overcoming obstacles. 5. reflection as i reflected on the book, i realized that the central message is about the power of determination and resilience in the face of adversity. the author supports this message through the stories of women who defied societal norms and expectations to pursue their dreams and passions. the implications of the author's argument are far-reaching, as it challenges traditional gender roles and expectations while inspiring readers to embrace their own unique paths. by sharing these stories, the author encourages readers to question societal norms and strive for personal growth and self-discovery. 6. skill reproduce to apply the skills learned from the book, one could start by identifying personal passions and interests. next, consider any societal expectations or barriers that may be hindering progress towards those goals. then, develop a plan to overcome those obstacles through determination, resilience, and self-discovery. finally, seek out support from -minded individuals who can provide encouragement and guidance along the way. 7. reasoning (qa or interview) q what inspired the author to write this book? a the author was likely inspired by a desire to shed light on the often overlooked role of women in maritime history and challenge traditional gender norms. q how did these women manage to defy societal expectations? a these women demonstrated courage, determination, and resilience in the face of adversity. they also found support from -minded individuals who encouraged and empowered them to pursue their dreams. q what can we learn from their stories? a we can learn the importance of embracing our passions, standing up for our beliefs, and overcoming obstacles through determination and resilience. 8. pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller once upon a time, in a world where the sea was dominated by men, there were brave and adventurous women who dared to defy societal norms. some of these women became pirate queens, anne bonny and mary read, who sailed the high seas and fought alongside their male counterparts. others, ellen macarthur, broke records as sailors, proving that women could be just as skilled and fearless as men. then there were the women who took matters into their own hands, elizabeth black betty thayres, who disguised herself as a man and stowed away on a whaling ship. these women showed incredible courage and determination, proving that nothing could hold them back. these stories remind us that no matter what society tells us, we all have the power to pursue our dreams and break free from constraints. so let's remember the lessons of these brave women and always believe in ourselves, no matter what others may say.","completion":"written"}
