However, her seemingly perfect life takes a dark turn when she starts experiencing vivid nightmares and hallucinations. As the line between reality and fantasy begins to blur, Sarah finds herself questioning her sanity and struggling to distinguish between what is real and what is not. With the help of a therapist, Sarah delves into her past to uncover the truth behind her disturbing visions, but she soon realizes that the answers she seeks may put her in grave danger.\\n\\n1. Basics (Genre, Premise, Key Takeaways)\\nLost Temptation falls under the genre of psychological thrillers. The premise revolves around the idea that success and perfection come at a price, and sometimes, the cost is too high to bear. The key takeaways from this book include the importance of seeking help when dealing with mental health issues, the dangers of ignoring our subconscious, and the power of the human mind to deceive us.\\n\\n2. Characters or Key Figures\\nSarah is the protagonist of the story, and her character development is remarkable. Initially, she comes across as confident and self-assured, but as the story progresses, we see a vulnerable and fragile side to her. Her husband, Mark, is a supportive and loving partner, but his actions raise some red flags as the plot thickens. The therapist, Dr. Patel, plays a pivotal role in helping Sarah unravel the mysteries of her past and present.\\n\\n3. Major Themes (Ideas, Arguments, Approaches, Solutions)\\nOne of the major themes of the book is the importance of confronting our past to move forward. Sarah's nightmares and hallucinations are a manifestation of her subconscious, trying to tell her something. By facing her past traumas head-on, Sarah is able to gain clarity and find peace. Another theme is the danger of living a double life. Sarah's obsession with perfection and success leads her down a path of deceit and lies, which ultimately puts her in harm's way.\\n\\n4. Top 5 helpful advices from the book\\n1. Seek help: If you are struggling with mental health issues, don't hesitate to seek professional help. It's okay to admit that you need support, and it's a sign of strength, not weakness.\\n2. Confront your past: Dealing with our past traumas is never easy, but it's essential to move forward. By facing our past head-on, we can gain clarity and find peace.\\n3. Be true to yourself: Living a double life may seem like the easy way out, but it ultimately leads to more problems than solutions. Being true to yourself, even if it means admitting your flaws, is the key to happiness and fulfillment.\\n4. Trust your instincts: Our intuition is a powerful tool, and we should trust it. If something feels off, it probably is. Listen to your gut and act accordingly.\\n5. Learn to let go: Holding onto grudges and resentments only leads to pain and suffering. Learning to forgive and let go is a crucial step towards healing and moving forward.\\n\\n5. Reflection\\nThe central message of the book is that success and perfection come at a price, and sometimes, the cost is too high to bear. The author supports this message by highlighting the negative consequences of Sarah's obsession with success and perfection. The implications of this argument are profound, as it encourages us to reevaluate our priorities and values. By focusing on what truly matters, we can find happiness and fulfillment without sacrificing our mental health and well-being.\\n\\n6. Skill Reproduce\\nTo implement the skill of confronting our past, we can follow these steps:\\n1. Identify the past trauma: This could be a specific event or a series of events.\\n2. Understand the impact: Reflect on how this trauma has affected your life and relationships.\\n3. Challenge your beliefs: Question the negative beliefs and thoughts that have arisen as a result of this trauma.\\n4. Seek support: Reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist for support and guidance.\\n5. Practice self-compassion: Be kind and gentle with yourself as you navigate through this process.\\n\\n7. Reasoning (Q&A or Interview)\\nQ: Why do you think Sarah's obsession with perfection led her down a dangerous path?\\nA: Sarah's obsession with perfection led her down a dangerous path because she was willing to do whatever it took to maintain her image. This included lying, cheating, and manipulating others, which ultimately put her in harm's way. By ignoring her subconscious and the warning signs, Sarah was blinded by her own success and failed to see the danger lurking beneath the surface.\\n\\nQ: How did Sarah's relationship with her husband change throughout the book?\\nA: Sarah's relationship with her husband, Mark, changed significantly throughout the book. Initially, their marriage seemed perfect, but as Sarah's nightmares and hallucinations intensified, cracks began to appear. Mark's behavior raised some red flags, and Sarah started to question his loyalty and fidelity. By the end of the book, their relationship had deteriorated, and Sarah realized that she needed to prioritize her own well-being over her marriage.\\n\\n8. Pretend to teach it to a child as a storyteller\\nOnce upon a time, there was a woman named Sarah. She was very successful and had everything she wanted, except for one thing - peace. Sarah started having strange dreams and seeing things that weren't there. She didn't know what to do, so she went to see a therapist. The therapist helped Sarah understand that her dreams and hallucinations were a manifestation of her subconscious, trying to tell her something. By facing her past traumas head-on, Sarah was able to gain clarity and find peace. She also learned that living a double life wasn't worth the risk and that being true to herself was the key to happiness and fulfillment. Sarah's story teaches us that success and perfection come at a price, and sometimes, the cost is too high to bear. It's essential to confront our past, trust our instincts, and learn to let go. By prioritizing our mental health and well-being, we can find happiness and fulfillment without sacrificing our values.\",\n          \"I cant pick the phone right now.

Good evening, Mr. Mayor. Members of the council, thank you for having us here this evening. I'm just going to provide a little context. Before Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, provides the the formal report on this. And there's a misconception, it appears in the public that the discussion between temporary parklets and permanent parklets and that the existing temporary structures could potentially be converted to permanent. And before we get started, I just want to make sure everybody's clear that that is not the case. Permanent parklet structures have very different requirements than temporary parklet structures. I'm here to tell you tonight that none of the temporary structures currently anywhere in the city would qualify as a permanent structure. And in each case, those structures would have to be removed and a new structure would be installed, assuming that it meets the requirements of a permanent structure, which are a lot more stringent than the temporary ones. So just to start it off, I wanted to make sure everybody understood that any discussion about making temporary parklets permanent does not mean that the existing structure would be revised to be considered permanent. So that said, I'd like to turn it over to Carl Hickman, our traffic engineer, who's going to give us an update this evening. Thank you.\\n Good evening, Mr. Mayor. And council members. This has been a long road. We've been working on Parklets now for 18 months or so and we've done quite a bit of work in public works to make the parklets of the program happen. Let's get started. There's a little bit of background regarding the parklets. Again, it was a citywide effort to support the economic recovery for businesses amid the social distancing health order. The first temporary parklets were installed in May of 2020. There was a vast majority that were installed for the 4th of July weekend in 2020. Programs peak citywide there were 124 temporary parklets 136 participating businesses because many businesses share parklets. Currently citywide, there are 96 Parklets installed and 99 participating businesses. Ten Parklets have been removed since September alone because we are in the process of removing Parklets. When we find that business owners no longer need them or they may request us further removals, so we do have an ongoing process. When I'm contacted to remove the park, this whenever possible. Now as a licensed traffic engineer, one of my main concerns with apartments is safety. Here are some of the safety elements that I look at when we consider installing temporary parklets. We want to look to see that we have that object marker on the corner of the park that you see the yellow and black sign. That designates the corner of the parklet. We want to make sure that the remaining traveled way that's the roadway between the edge of the parklet and the centerline is a minimum of 12 feet. Now we can varied from that occasionally, but it depends on the situation. 12 feet is the typical standard. We do look at the structural elements of the of the parklet to make sure that it is sturdy. We also fill the plastic rails, a minimum of three quarters of the way with water to make sure that they are able to withstand the impact from a vehicle. We do look at many stormwater drainage elements to make sure that along a curb line, water can flow like it normally would along the gutter. We also look for safe pedestrian passage on the sidewalks, make sure that there's 88 clearances and we pay close attention to utility complex. There were some cases where some of the properties were installed over the top of gas lines that we didn't know existed. And then we found out later that we had to make modifications because we couldn't have the gas lines underneath the temporary parklets. And I want to reiterate that existing temporary parklets cannot simply convert automatically to a permanent status. These temporary apartments are not designed to be permanent. They are installed with temporary type materials. So any modification to a permanent status would be a major redo. Now, back in September, we were asked to take a closer look at the Belmont Shore area. Why is Belmont Shore unique? Well, first of all, it's a pretty high dense neighborhood, high density, a lot of businesses, services, amenities in the area, especially between Bayshore and Livingston. A lot of visitors visit the area. There's a lot of pedestrian activity, as you know. And of course, there's the nearby residential homes on both sides of the street. Second Street is kind of narrow, actually, although it's two lanes in each direction. It's still a relatively narrow roadway and it provides a direct link to PCH, Pacific Coast Highway. So really, second Street acts almost like an arterial that is really meant to serve a large volume of vehicles. Obviously there are impacts to nearby residents with all of the activity in the area. It is an attractor, definitely. And of course, as I mentioned, all the traffic that goes up and down. Second is an important factor. Also the area does impact the coastal zone on the area from Livingston to Clermont is actually in the local coastal zone. Which means that any kind of discussion with the coastal zone and a decision by the local coastal zone would mean that is not appealable. So current conditions in CD3, in the entire council district, there are 38 total temporary parklets and 38 participating businesses. On Belmont Shore Loan from Second Street to Bay Shore, there are 25 temporary parklets. 30 participating businesses. Four Parklets are shared by two or more businesses. Three businesses have a pair of temporary parklets. That means one on second and one on a side street. And we also removed eight temporary parklets to date again as businesses contact us or we deem them unnecessary. We do the removals as quickly as we can. One of the issues that has come up quite often is the parking impacts in Belmont Shaw. And we did a very good inventory of all the parking spaces and we found that there were 517 total metered spaces on street, there's 351 and the public lots, there was 166 total, again 517 so far to date, as we sit right now, there are 56 stalls converted to temporary parklets, 38 stalls on Second Street and 18 stalls on the side streets. The total available for parking still is 461 stalls. So really we've converted 11% of the total available metered stalls to parklets temporary parklets. 7% on Second Street and 4% on the side streets. And there's a graphic representation there, you know, with your pie, the slice of the pie that shows the 56 out of the total available 517. Now, since the beginning of the program, we've had many opportunities to reach out to the public, reach out to businesses. And most recently, we reached out to the folks on Belmont Shore to have a community meeting. We've started public and business surveys. We've had multiple discussions with CD3 and we've had multiple field inspections and business visits where we talk really candidly with the business owners, talk about are they using the the parklets? Are there any problems? Do we need to make any adjustments? It's an ongoing thing and it's not going to stop. And we really think that that one on one conversation with the businesses is really a good, healthy conversation because the businesses need to understand how they're impacting not only the area, the residents, the street, but the city as a whole. Because, you know, Belmont sure is an important part of the city. So regarding our outreach, we have three parts. The first part of our outreach really was related to the business owners themselves. So we had a total of 584 total responses. And of those 584, there were 12 businesses that responded. Ten businesses are interested in keeping the temporary parklets through June of next year. Ten businesses are interested in applying for a permanent parklet. 83% agree that their temporary parklet helped their business recover amid health order and social distancing. And they also admitted that only 2% are staff to at least 95% of pre-COVID levels. One of the business owners said many guests still do not feel comfortable dining indoors but want to support local restaurants, etc.. The next step in our outreach was that we wanted to talk to residents and customers of the 584 responses. You can see on the on the pie charts a lot of the percentages. I won't go through all of the data, but you can see that, you know, in the center there, 30% of the customers never really use the parklets. 19% use them once a month, etc.. On the far right, you can see the chart that talks about neighborhood foot traffic, what kind of pedestrian activity is in the area, and 56% supply of the comment that there was really no change in pedestrian activity. I'll leave that there just for a second. If you want to take a quicker look. A longer look. Part three of the outreach. We again had 584 total responses and there were 572 customer or resident responses out of the 584. 38% support the program. 11% support but with restrictions. 12% are concerned about the parking. 6% traffic sightlines. 14% congestion and parking. And 9% were concerned about accessibility and esthetics. So on the right you'll see that the top concerns were the parking impacts, sidewalk access, esthetics, driver sightlines noise, especially on the side streets and quality of life issues . Quality of life issues could mean some of the patrons in the restaurants or bars maybe be loitering alongside the businesses or near the residents. Some of those quality of life issues could be excessive noise. There were a variety of other complaints, again, that we call quality of life that may not be directly attributable to the parties themselves . But nevertheless, the issue is there that needs to be addressed. And there's, again, a variety of positive feedback. Many folks value the outdoor dining option. It improves the walkability and enhances the experience. Character of Belmont Shore. Now, since the beginning of the program, we've always worked to do ongoing adjustments or improvements. We address each issue on a case by case basis. We remove temporary parklets by request. As I mentioned prior, we constantly look to make sure the departments are at the right footprint, in other words, in front of the business. There are many cases where over time the actual footprint or the perimeter of the park, this has been changed. You know, some of the business owners are kind of pushing out a little bit and expanding. So we want to make sure that people have the parklets where they're supposed to be. We're checking in and filling barricade water levels and we're making sure that businesses who are nearby are okay with any encroachment into their areas. And we continue inspections by staff regularly. Now after the Open Streets Initiative ends again, existing temporary parks are not approved or designed to be permanent. We have an existing permanent parklet guideline shown there on the left. That's the cover of it that's been used by the city since 2008. So it's nothing new. We already have that program in place. And if you're in the downtown area, you'll see many permanent parks already installed. On the right there, you'll see a poster board somebody created. And the first sentence says that the city of Long Beach is considering making outdoor dining parklets permanent. That is not true. We are not pushing to make temporary parklets permanent. Now moving forward on Second Street. We do already have guidelines in place for businesses who want to make permanent parklets. Here's a picture of a business the socialist that fought in Saint Louis. You'll see how the sidewalk pushes out or bulbs out away from the business a little bit further. And their they're of utilizing the hardscape to put their tables and chairs, etc.. So this is a standard that businesses who are near a corner could implement. Obviously, it's going to be for the business to install. They're going to have to pay for it. But this is an installation that we are already doing in the city, so it's nothing new. Next slide here. Again, this is what we would call a semi-permanent parklet. Again, this is an existing location, Berlin Bistro Fourth and Linden, where as part of the guideline on the right there, you'll see how we design this type of a parklet to be semi-permanent. If that business were to go away, we could technically remove that parklet and it would be a done deal. So ideally I mentioned earlier in the presentation that we had ten businesses who were interested in becoming permanent parklets. And really I think that that was sort of a knee jerk reaction to our last meeting back in September, where many businesses were probably unsure of the program, where it was going. A couple of those businesses who have applied to be permanent, we were already removed their temporary parklets. So but let's look at the worst case scenario. If those ten permanent parklet businesses who want permanent parklets were to actually get them go through the process. We're talking about a loss of approximately 20 stalls. The original total meet total needed spaces is 517. So we would only have to convert 4%, approximately 4% of the stalls to permanent parklets. And I want to point out that businesses need to understand that when it comes time to do a permanent parklet, not only do they have to go through the rigorous process that's already in place, but there will be a cost associated with that to design the installation, etc.. And I'm predicting those costs are in the neighborhood of 40 to $50000, depending on the the nature of the exact install. So again, this is not something that's just a slam dunk. There is a rigorous process already in place. So to wrap things up, we do have recommendations for Second Street, and I'll go through them slowly here. The first recommendation is to continue improvements, adjustments and inspections of existing temporary parklets. This is what we've been doing for the past 1820 months, making sure that the businesses are operating as they should be per their permits. We're going to coordinate with businesses, businesses to remove temporary parklets whenever possible. Again, I mentioned where it's an ongoing process. We're going to work with businesses not interested in the permanent parklet so that removal of the temporary parklet can take place as quickly as possible. We're going to check and refill all water filled barricades, maintain proper approvals and assurance documentation. Businesses have their insurances last quite frequently, so we have to make sure that we're on top of that. And again, anybody who's going to be interested in a permanent parklet, we're going to direct them to the existing sidewalk dining and park this handbook that is already in place since 2018. The next thing is Pakistan. Minor side streets will no longer be allowed in cases where there are multiple documented violations. The key here is multiple documented violations. Next. Businesses interested in a permanent Parklet must communicate in intent to apply for a permanent parklet by January 31st of next year. This will allow businesses to keep their temporary parklet until June 30th or 22 as they work through the process to finish their permanent parklet installations. We're going to organize a single effort to obtain local coastal zone approval for the businesses on Belmont Shore. We're going to facilitate permanent parklets that meet current construction and safety standards. And our overall goal is to allocate no more than 3 to 7% of stalls to permanent parklet installations. That concludes my presentation. And we are ready to field any questions that you may have. Thank you. There are two people queued up for public comment. Please come forward. And Jason Ileus and Brian Cochran. John, excuse me, John. I this is John here. Okay. Is Brian here? Okay, come forward. Brian. What was that? John? Okay. All right. Make your way to the front. Thank you. Good evening. My name is John Ayers.\\n And I'm a property.\\n Owner in Belmont Shore.\\n As do parklets. Item 47 Parking in the short takes away needed parking as it was addressed and increases the occupancy levels for restaurants without providing adequate parking. Restaurants often have sidewalk dining as well as parklets for those who don't want to eat indoors. Today. Owners. Restaurants can select indoor dining as well as sidewalk dining. Again. I sent a. I had expressed my concerns a couple of months ago. At the at her. Council meeting. And I also sent a text to each council member in the past two months months expressing what I had just mentioned. Thank you. Thank you, Brian. Good evening, Mayor Garcia and city council members. I first like to thank Councilwoman Suzy Price and her team for continuing this important dialog on the park issue and for engaging our constituents in a robust, thoughtful manner. That's been very helpful. I'd like to urge the Council tonight to stop viewing and stop framing this issue as an either or situation that in order for businesses to survive, all considerations of residents, valid and exhaustive concerns must be secondary or worst ignored entirely. When the Council met on this issue in September. You heard from actual residents detailing both personally and on behalf of their neighbors the deep and detrimental impacts of these markets on their daily quality of life. 13 speakers addressed the council. All residents there urged a no vote on continuing the program. The other five speakers were all business owners, managers or employees of those businesses. Is it any surprise they urged continuing the program to their benefit. Similarly, with the Public Works surveys, which seem to gain the questions to get a desired outcome, what kind of a fair survey actually points out that a business owner in the district can fill out three surveys? Of course, they and their customers want to keep the parklets running. It benefits them directly. But after the vote of that September meetings concluded, only one one owner stuck around to talk with residents and expressed an interest in their needs as neighbors and to suggest he'd help with the quality of life issues. Just one owner. Since then, we've only seen abuses of these public spaces continue unabated and worsen. I walked Second Street again repeatedly since then on November 20th alone. I photographed vomit on a sidewalk next to a restaurant so much that a mom of a stroller had to skirt delicately around the stench near another restaurant. Piles of sawdust or judgment remains after some sort of food supply fallen in the street and occupied three or colleagues. Since the council turned to a lot of parklets, it's long overdue to enforce existing laws and rules and track every issue in a simple and transparent manner. City agencies and language police must be responsive to noise, traffic, trash and mobility complaints by the residents who encounter these abuses daily. This is not a new issue. It's not an either or. Since these businesses have been granted a lifeline by the city and its residents, it's essential that they act as good neighbors and accept responsibility for the impact of their moneymaking endeavors that have caused residents so much of their quality of life. Councilmembers Pleas and the Parking Program on Second Street in the Pier Arts Interchange. Please put some teeth into enforcing the abuses created by the program. Thank you very much.\\n Thank you. That concludes public comment. Taking behind the dias, Councilwoman Fries.\\n Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. So I want to start by thanking our staff for your work on this. I know that beyond just the three gentlemen that are here tonight presenting, there is a team of people whose work who have worked very hard on this issue, and they've been engaged with my office throughout the entire few months that we've been studying this issue. And you've really taken their concerns to heart, and this report is fantastic. So thank you. I really, really appreciate that. I also want to thank the community members. We had so many community members volunteer to go door to door to pass out the cards for the surveys. And that was really important. And I think that's one of the reasons that we had about 584 responses. And and so I want to thank them both. The Belmont.\\n Shore Residents Association and the and the Friends of Belmont Shore were two community.\\n Organizations that worked very closely with me on this issue. It's interesting when you have an issue like this, because depending on who you talk to, they will swear that everyone they have talked to agrees with them on the issue. So over the last couple of months, I've gotten emails that say, you know, I have lived in the city in certain number of years and I everyone that I have talked to insert opposes or supports the PARKLETS and I just have gotten a ton of emails like that and there's absolutely no consensus by the residents entirely on the issue of Parklets on Second Street. And I will say that I suspect and there's probably some data to support that multiple people took that survey. The Baltimore people took the survey multiple times. And I don't know which side of whether they're supporting our opposing, but the survey is meant to be an outreach effort. It's not a scientific survey. It's an outreach effort to try to gauge interest. And I want to thank staff for putting it together. I also want to thank a staff for clarifying that. And I'm not sure where this confusion occurred, and I'm disappointed that it did. But the permanent PARKLET program is totally different from the Open Streets Initiative. We've had permanent parklet options available in the city forever. All of this in my district, the social list. These are all businesses that have gotten permanent parklets way before the COVID pandemic even hit. So to conflate those two is has has mixed up the message quite a bit. And in fact, I myself, when I was reading the presentation earlier, thought Slide 15 was relevant to our current situation and not the hypothetical situation of permanent parklets being issued. So there is a lot of confusion there, and I just want to thank staff for clarifying that. I do want to point out that some eight, I believe, is that current eight parklets were removed. Eight Parklets were removed as a result of our discussions and our efforts. And what we did was we went out and Mr. Cochrane talked about the business owners that were here last time. Both the Panama Joes owner, as well as the Georges Greek owner, stayed after the last council meeting, and the Panama Joes owner actually voluntarily removed their parklet. So we've had eight parklets removed, which to me is tremendous. If we're talking about parking spots lost, this huge number of parking spots gained. We also were able to remove some parklets. Some businesses had two parklets like fills, and we were able to remove that. I want to. Okay. So a couple of questions for staff. I think enforcement to me is the biggest key here. And I'm going to approve staff's recommendation. I'm going to ask I'm going to vote in favor of staff's recommendation and I'm going to ask my colleagues to do the same. But I do want to make a motion, and I know the city attorney's on the line. I'm going to turn over to him in just a minute for Art Sanchez. I'm not sure if he's in here or on the line, but I do want to talk a little bit about every Parklet permit committee has to follow certain guidelines and standards, and there are good neighbor policies that are outlined here that basically say any violations or the permit can be revised, the conditions can be revised if any complaints are received and the permit may be revoked.\\n If there is a nuisance.\\n Situation. So I want to turn it over to the city attorney, Mr. Sanchez, and ask him if you can explain to us what that process is, because I would like to have a report back within 30 days that highlights what that process is and what efforts we've made to outreach to the community, what that processes for a permanent revocation of a temporary parklet for a violator of the good neighbor policy. So, Mr. Sanchez, can I ask you to explain that?\\n Certainly. Councilwoman Pryce. So what would happen is we would have to have documentation of whatever the violation is, and it would have to be it would be done by venue task force at this point. And once we receive the documentation of the violation, we would reach out to the business owner, have them make somewhat immediate corrections, and if those corrections aren't made, we would move forward with removal of the parklet. Now that's you know, it's kind of in general in terms of the removal, assuming that violations exist and violations aren't corrected in a timely manner. Then we would post a notice providing the business with 72 hours to basically remove all items that had been collected at the parklet. They have an opportunity from. I believe, five days after the posting of the notice to request a hearing to appeal the removal of the parklet, the parklet would still be removed. The appeal would occur after the fact, and then we would just have that hearing and make a determination about the removal. And that is generally the process. If you have any questions like I've tried, answer.\\n Okay. So my time is up, so I'm going to.\\n Take.\\n You back up. For it.\\n Okay. Thank you. So, Mr. Sanchez, is there any way that we can document that process so that residents are aware of it? Because I know that residents have called the police in regards to some parklets and feel like they haven't had much of a process. So is there any way to document that process and then outreach it?\\n Um. Yes, I guess we could have it done through a combination of public works and the venue task force can come up with a written process that outlines that it can post it. I guess it would be on the Public Works website.\\n Okay, that sounds great. And my office will also help in getting the process out to the community once we have a process. And I think within that write up, there should be some sort of clear identification of what that threshold is. Is it just a simple complaint is a sustained violation. You know, a lot of times neighbors will call, for example, of a good neighbor policies, talk a lot about noise and loitering. So what happens is when they call that in, oftentimes code enforcement is not in a position to respond at midnight or 11 p.m. or even 9:30 p.m.. That's just those are not hours that code enforcement is able to respond. So then the resident is really left without recourse. And so I'd like, you know, a call to the police department and a police response to to qualify as one of the documented complaints that was either substantiated or not. So just nothing. I'm not making a motion as to how you effectuate this this process, but just a suggestion for when you do write it up that it would be good for residents to have some clarity. So with that, I do want to highlight just a couple of things. Unless, Mr. Sanchez unless there's anything else you want to add.\\n In response to the talking points that I just raised.\\n But, yes, so in terms of the violations, there would have to be some investigation that would be conducted. That investigation would include reviewing whatever calls for service that are for that particular location. And so that information would be reviewed. That would be some of the things that we would look into to confirm that the activity or the violation is occurring at that particular business.\\n Okay. Thank you, Mr. Sanchez. And that takes me to slide number six. There's a bullet point that says Parklets on minor side streets will no longer be allowed in cases where there are multiple documented violations. So the attorney in me is reading this saying, what's the definition of minor and what is documented violations mean and what is the staff's recommendation as to this bullet? Are we going to be removing any parklets that currently exist on the side street?\\n Yes. To answer your question, Councilwoman Price, the minor side street would be any of the streets that intersect Second Street perpendicular, so streets like Glendora, Saint Joseph Park, etc. those are the minor streets. Second Street is the major street. That's how we refer to it. And traffic engineering. And then when we talk about multiple documented violations, again, we're talking about what Mr. Sanchez referred to as when someone goes out and investigates, you know, did they hear a loud noise? Was there a health order violation? Was there some or some other kind of quality of life issue that was documented? And then when we have, depending on the severity of those issues that we that are documented, when we have a significant number of those that are documented, we can move to the next step to possibly start the removal process, the notification, working with the business owner to correct if possible or go straight to the notification and the posting of the notice to remove.\\n Okay. And I assume that we're not pressing reset tonight as if no violations have already occurred, that what has occurred in the past that has been documented will be considered by staff moving forward?\\n That is correct. And we are quite familiar with many of the so-called bad actors out there and what's been going on.\\n Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. And on behalf of the residents, I thank you for that process. And, you know, I do I will say that we talk a lot about the loss of parking. In fact, I was at a friend's apartment short meeting the other night and someone was talking about the loss of parking . It is an 11% loss of parking. And, you know, one of the speakers talked about when we occupy those parking spots, we're not filling them. And so we're under parked. But a lot of the parklets are filled mostly in the evenings and a lot of our retail shops and services are closed at those times. So the parking spots that would be allotted, let's say, for the large lounge as an example or any other business or even fills, those parking spots really aren't used at night.\\n So people will go to the restaurants.\\n At night and they'll have more parking available because so many of the service businesses and some of the retail shops and daytime businesses are closed. So. So I support staff's recommendation. I know. It's not going to make everyone happy. But I do appreciate that we are eight less as a result and that we're still working to reduce as business needs change for the restaurants. And yes, this is a business friendly initiative, but it's also an initiative that we're trying to make resident friendly as well. So thank you very much. I appreciate it. And thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor, for indulging me that few extra minutes.\\n Sure thing. Thank you. Members, please cast your vote and then we'll go to 34.\\n She miscarried. Item 34 Communication from Vice Mayor Richardson. Councilwoman Zendejas. Councilwoman Allen. Recommendations Direct City Manager to Sunset Long Beach Municipal Code. Chapter 5.535.55 and 8.110. No sooner than February 28th, 2022.\",\n          \"Uncertified sick leave\",\n          \" The following is a conversation with Thomas Tall, founder of Legendary Entertainment, known for producing blockbusters like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy, the Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300, and many more. He runs Talco, which is an investment company that focuses on how artificial intelligence can revolutionize large industries. He is part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. He's the guitarist for the band Ghost Hounds that tours with the Rolling Stones. But most importantly, he's humble, down to earth, and someone who has quickly become a mentor and friend. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, here's my conversation with Thomas Tall. In 2004, you founded Legendary Entertainment, known for producing blockbusters like Batman's Dark Knight Trilogy that includes Batman Begins, Dark Knight, and Dark Knight Rises, the Hangover franchise, Godzilla, Inception, Jurassic World, 300, and the list goes on. It's just some of the biggest movies in history. What does it take to make an epic movie like that? What does it take to make it happen from start to finish? Well, look, I've been enamored with movies since I was a kid as a fan, and I think what you need is to be able to tell a great story. And if you're gonna tell a great story, you need a great director. You gotta start with a fantastic script that is able to take some of these iconic characters that we did and put your own stamp on it while still respecting the mythology. And I had zero experience in movies and television before I started Legendary, so it was a very interesting trip. Total luck that we had the opportunity to make five movies at the time with Chris Nolan, who turned out to be one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. But each one is its own little startup company, and I don't think there's any formula to get there, but I know that if you don't have a great director and a great script, if you don't have that foundation, it's hard to pull off. Who's the CEO of that little startup company? Is it the director, who would you say kind of defines the success or the failure of a movie? Well, when you build a big movie like that, it's an enormous effort, 360 degrees. I mean, from digital effects, certainly the actors. I mean, if you have an amazing script and amazing director, but you don't believe anybody playing the parts, that's a problem. So the reason I think it was so difficult to pull off is I always used to say, you start with a stack of papers with words on it called a script, bring that to life, and you're asking an audience to believe in everything that you're trying to put out there, and you've got a cast that, even if they're immensely talented individually, they have to mesh together, they have to have chemistry together. And the director is kind of a general on the battlefield, but if you have a strong producer who's very hands-on, but it truly to me is each one had its own story and its own sort of how it came to be and why it worked or didn't work. See, you said you were new to the industry, but you did a lot of revolutionary things with Legendary. So at that time and now, what is the good, the bad, and the ugly of the business of filmmaking? What are some interesting holes that you were able to, or like problems that you were able to fix? What problems still exist that can still be solved? Well, look, the business has changed so radically since 2004. When I started Legendary, DVDs were still a cash cow. So, you know, that's how far things have come. But I would say a couple of things. The reason that I started it from a business perspective was at the time it was a $30 billion industry, and there was no institutional capital around the movie business. And I was fascinated by that because almost every other category that you look at of that size has institutional capital, private equity, et cetera, as kind of a cottage industry set up around it. And I was perplexed and fascinated that that didn't occur. And the way the movie business worked was unlike any business I'd ever looked at before. So after kind of convincing myself that you could actually make money if you were disciplined and had the right approach, you know, went out, raised the money from the capital markets, markets which was Herculean, still maybe the hardest thing I've ever done in my career, to walk around and say, look, I have no experience. I've never done this before, but you know. And the second thing, being very fortunate at the time, was able to partner up with Warner Brothers. Warner's at the time was run by a man named Alan Horn, who besides being creative is also a Harvard MBA. So really understood what I wanted to do. And Alan, you know, was just an absolute gentleman, someone that I still look up to to this day. After Warner Brothers, he went and ran Disney with their run, you know, between Marvel and Star Wars and everything. And so between Alan being responsible for Harry Potter, the Dark Knight stuff, and then onto all the Disney stuff, he probably had as great a career as anyone I've ever heard of in the movie business. So my first focus was around sort of two concepts, global, worldwide, large tent pole films and franchises, and then the business aspect of being, bringing long-term institutional capital to bear. I'm gonna ask you dumb questions, which is part of the style, I guess. But just for people who don't know, including me, what is institutional, what is capital? What is institutional capital? What is equity, what is private equity? Got it, okay. Well, so if you're starting a company and you go around to a bunch of your successful friends and say, hey, you should invest in my company, well, that's sort of, that's great and it's capital, but it's not getting money from Fidelity or T-Row or a sovereign wealth fund or an endowment fund from a university that has large pools of organized capital that has a long-term point of view on your business. So if you get money from your neighbor who's a successful dentist, next year, the dentist may say, hey, times are hard, I need my money back. If your partner's with Fidelity or Morgan Stanley or any of these institutions, they have the capital and the wherewithal to say, okay, I'm looking at this over the next five to 10 years. And I thought there was an opportunity to bring that type of capital to the movie business to be patient. And the benefit of that, patient, so it's long-term, you have to deal with fewer parties and they would do much larger investments. So what are the benefits? What are the sort of the challenges of that kind of investment? Well, I think the benefits in some ways are the professionals who are largely dispassionate. Right, it's like, look, if you're hitting the numbers you told me and you're hitting your plan, great. And the other thing that always was interesting to me about the movie business is if I'm investing in our artificial intelligence company or a chipset company or something like that, a lot of the institutions don't have the technical expertise to really truly grasp what's being done. So they don't, other than good business practices they're not offering every little opinion. The movies and television are completely approachable. Meaning everybody has an opinion. So whether it's, I think you guys chose the wrong actor for that or why did you do that movie? It's, so it invites a lot more sort of second guessing and things like that. So that was always one of the idiosyncrasies of the business that I thought was, you know, was interesting. And then when you talk about private equity versus public equity, if you're a public company where the companies can, are traded, you wanna buy Microsoft shares, you just go to your broker go on TD Ameritrade and buy them. If on the other hand, you're talking about private equity that's institutions or individuals investing in private companies. So thus the, if you have pools of capital that mostly invest in private equity deals, that's how you think about it. It's difficult to make those happen because it's individuals, you have to sort of, what have dinners and agree. So it's much less, it's much more human, much less mechanical, I would say. Yeah, now, and again, massive difference between large private equity shops who are professionalized and in the same category that I mentioned earlier versus private individuals who are wealthy or whatever. But again, it's much more individualized when you're going to people who like your idea and just say, I'd like to invest in this. Is that from all the kinds of investments you've seen, what do you think is the most conducive to creating works of genius? Whether that's in technology, AI space, or whether that's in movies. So creating something special in this world. I would say a couple of things. Enough money that whatever endeavor you're going into that you're not so nervous about the edges, right? If I have $100 to spend and I think I can create a perpetual motion machine or something for $104, I can't do it because they're all over me about the budget. So I would say making sure that you have enough capital, making sure that that capital is patient enough so that it's, if you're gonna do things that are extraordinary, it takes some time and you're gonna break stuff, right? You're gonna make mistakes. You're gonna have a whole bunch of film on the cutting room floor, so to speak. Or if you're in the lab, you're gonna have a whole bunch of broken stuff. And I also think it's very important at the beginning, and I always try to do this with companies I invest in or buy is make sure that you have a philosophical and somewhat mechanical alignment with the management team. So that going in, you both understand, hey, this is how we think about this problem or this company. This is what we feel like our culture is. This is what our goal is. And these are the metrics by which we'll agree to measure them by. Because if you don't have that shared, hey, we're gonna take this journey, then I think that's where people get upset, disappointed, et cetera. What about, this is a weird question, but constraints. So this is both for filmmaking and investment. Do you think more money is always better? No. So I like constraints a lot. It's like constraints and almost like a desperation and deadlines are catalysts for creativity, for productivity, for sort of innovation. So can you kind of speak to that as an investor, as a creator, what's the right balance here? Well, I think if you're focused on a particular problem or a company or a thesis, if you have that focus and you feel like I have unlimited resources or renewable resources, so there's really, there's no leverage in the situation. There's no, if I fail at this, I'll just go get more money. I'll just go, I think that's a hard way to be resilient and to think of new ways to solve problems. So I think capitalizing things just to the nth degree does create some problems. So I think there's that perfect blend of, don't starve the oxygen to the point where you make short-term decisions or non-strategic or thoughtful decisions because you gotta pay the rent. And on the other hand, you can't have it be like this, everlasting gobstopper of whatever you want will just keep flowing the cash because that doesn't create any friction points that I think do result in works of genius and things that are transformative. And one of the things that is interesting to me about society sort of writ large is I think that when you go through hard times and you have to do things that are uncomfortable and you don't wanna do them, because you're tired, because you're, that in some ways builds up that you're comfortable being uncomfortable muscle. And I sometimes think we're losing that a little bit and you can't sort of paint with a wide brush, but that's one of the things that I kind of observe and hope that we don't go that way. I do think challenge and discomfort are a kind of gift. It's like overcoming that. It's like from every perspective, from a human perspective, it's a source of happiness and fulfillment, overcoming challenge. But from a business perspective, I see like if something is really difficult, to me it's also a sign that most others would or many others would fail at this point. So like it's a feature. It's nice that something is difficult. When people tell you that something is impossible, I love that, cause it's like, all right, well then that's what a lot of people would believe. And that gives you an opportunity to be the person who shows it's not impossible. And you of course, you might be wrong, but if you're not wrong, you have the opportunity to stand out. So going through that hardship, taking those big risks, it's going to really pay off. So like discomfort is a feature, not a bug, of both personal life, it's just good for life, but for business it seems like just good business sense. If something is hard, it's probably a good idea to do that. Yeah. Cause most others will fail. Fun question. I don't know if you can answer this, but what's the most expensive movie you were involved with to make and why was it? You don't have to say numbers, but like is something stand out as being exceptionally expensive and why is it expensive? Um, I think Jurassic World was pretty expensive. Nice. I mean, it worked out great. And, uh. That's an epic film by the way. It, look, it's one of my favorites. They just did an amazing job. And frankly, the crazy thing about my life is all the stuff that I loved as a kid somehow came full circle back into my adult life. And having the opportunity while I was out there to develop a friendship with Steven Spielberg and then have my name on the same film as Steven Spielberg. I mean, that was pretty surreal. So that was an expensive film. You know, Dark Knight Rises was an expensive film. But again, to me, there's a difference between expensive and irresponsible and expensive because the vision warranted and it turned out financially it certainly did. Yeah, with Jurassic World, it's, I mean, I can't even imagine having those meetings because like you have to create so much and so much of it is obviously not real. You can't bring dinosaurs in. Is that where a lot of the cost is? Is in the, you know, the computer side of things? Yeah, those are generally pretty massive components of the budget and especially if you're doing it and inventing things as you go. I mean, Jim Cameron is one of those filmmakers who, you know, is designing the plane as it's flying in such a brilliant way. And, you know, I've got to know him over the years and just in awe of the way his brain works. And so, yeah, it's a big component. Can you speak a little bit more to him in terms of, because you're such a fascinating person because you care a lot about technology. You care a lot about the cutting edge of technology. So how does he, a creator, a director, build the plane while it's flying? Like what's the role of innovation in this whole process? Well, so I never made a film with Jim. I'm just a huge fan and got to know him and John Landau, his producing partner. And one of the things that just fascinates me about Jim is, so he makes Titanic and there's a bunch of underwater cameras and things that they need that don't exist. So he goes and invents them and, you know, has a good grasp of engineering and has not only the imagination, but the ability to lead a team to build them. I got to go down early when they were shooting Avatar at a warehouse, I think it was, where they were shooting. And as they were explaining to me how they were capturing it and that they could go back later because they created the environment, it blew my mind. And I said, okay, this is truly, people talk about a big leap. This certainly is one. So he has continued to push the envelope in terms of the art of the possible. And I just think he's an incredible genius in that way. Again, another hard question. So you are in the realm of music care about story, storytelling. Is there some aspect in which money and beautiful graphics get in the way of story? In filmmaking, so if you think about Jurassic World, obviously that's an experience like any other. Like what do you think about the tension between story, experience and like visual effects? Well, look, if you're using big effect shots and all kinds of tricks to cover the story, all kinds of tricks to cover over the fact that you don't have a very interesting story to tell, that's where I think it gets in the way. Where I think you have these incredible filmmakers, we mentioned Chris Nolan and Jim Cameron, Guillermo del Toro, you could go on and on, folks that just see the world differently and use technology to enhance the storytelling, right? To make you believe differently, rather to make you, not just suspend your disbelief, but to feel like you're immersed in it. So I've certainly seen it done expertly and I've seen it done poorly. You've talked about this a little bit in the past. You've kind of left the moviemaking business at an interesting time. Perhaps you saw the changes. There's been a lot of excitement with Netflix, with TV. So the role of film in society has changed. So what do you think is the future of movies versus TV? Like if you were as a business person, as a creator, as a consumer, as a technologist, are thinking about the next 10, 20 years, what do you think is going to be the godfather, the great pieces that move us as a society in the next 10, 20 years? Is it going to be TV? Is it going to be movie? Is it going to be a TikTok clips? What's it? Well, so, and I think the other category that I would add to that, that will be the next great medium is truly immersive virtual reality in which new storytellers will emerge, especially when you can go into VR and there's enough computing power to sustain it and to allow it to be social and for you to have different paths to go down. That'll be, I think, the next realm of what storytelling and experience will look like. Do you think a video game kind of world, or is it more movies, or is it more social network, or is it all of it kind of blending reality and gaming and movies? Yeah, I thought if you saw Ready Player One, which I love the book and the movie was cool too, but that's one version of it, right? Where you go in, now everybody's talking about the metaverse and all that, but you go into a world that's fully rendered as yourself and you interact with that world. The other side of it is to go in somewhere between being a passive observer but being able to move around your point of view and experiences, which I think is interesting. And then I think another adventure, so to speak, I could think of is a blend of video games. So there's a mission, right? There's obstacles, there's everything and you move through it, but it's immersive and it tells a story at the same time. And that's why I think you're gonna see new amazing storytellers that we don't know yet that understand how to innovate and how to make you feel something in that environment. And to your earlier point, I saw probably around 2015 when Netflix decided to be bold, put out House of Cards, put out all the episodes, leave you in charge of the pace at which you would view them, which I thought was great. That was a gutsy move. Yes, it was. And I can't tell you around Hollywood, anybody that says that everybody thought it was a great idea is not being truthful because everybody I talked to said this is, they're idiots. What do they know about moviemaking and TV? And what I saw happening was if you look at what Netflix pulled off and they realized that there isn't really a moat around the studios, you really could make stuff and really good stuff. And so they started to create their own content that pulled in Amazon, which pulled in Google through YouTube and then you had Hulu, then you had Disney deciding that they're gonna have Disney+. And the next thing you know, you have some of the biggest companies with the largest balance sheets on the planet being in the creative business. If you're an independent, that's bringing a knife to a gunfight to be sure. And so I thought that was interesting. The other thing that it used to be that movies were where the big things happened and television was sort of, it was small screen, different experience. And you had something like Game of Thrones come out, which was not only on the same epic level visually and storytelling wise, but had the budget to be able to do it. And now I think you're seeing all kinds of different storytelling taking place. And also like that you're not pigeonholed into a time. Like you got two hours to tell the story. You can do a three part mini series, a five part mini series. You can do television that's all kinds of different format. That I think allows creators to do a lot more interesting things. It is also interesting to consider the role of companies that enable that, like the capital that enables that. Without Netflix, you wouldn't, and HBO, you wouldn't have some of these epic shows. And so if we're thinking about the virtual reality world that you're talking about, it's interesting to consider who will enable that. Now, like you said, Facebook is talking about meta and metaverse, but it's unclear that just having money is enough. Netflix did a lot of really revolutionary stuff. There's a, Amazon has money. There's a lot of companies that have money that don't quite do as good of a job yet at enabling creators of creating revolutionary new content that changes the whole industry. And that's probably going to be the case with virtual reality. There is a lot of money needed to enable experiences like in terms of compute infrastructure. There needs to be a huge amount of money there, but you also need to somehow give freedom to creators to have fun, to do their best work. And at the same time, like provide the perfect amount of constraints, all of that together. Like however Netflix makes it happen, they do a pretty good job. Cause it's a very constrained platform, but yet all the creators I've ever talked to, comedians and so on that work with Netflix are really happy because they feel free to create their work. Yeah, and I think a lot of times, companies are a letterhead, but it boils down to the people. And I think I've known Ted Sarandos a long time who ran the studio at Netflix and now took over for Reed running the company. But Ted, very smart, talented guy and understood early how to cultivate talent and relationships with talent, which is important. When you're dealing with creative people, their motivations and their goals are not always the same. They're not always capitalistic. And so in terms of being able to communicate with creative people that are not always A to B to C is a talent. And so I think they did a great job. Ted did a great job with that early. But I think that you're gonna see different formats. I don't think, I mean, going to a theater to see a massive movie on that screen in that format is a fundamentally different experience. And I think you're gonna find movies, my old shop Legendary just put out Dune, which I thought was phenomenal. I, you know, when we secured the rights to Dune years ago, it was, I was over the moon because it's, I love the book. I love the entire world that is Dune. And that's a movie that I think you see on the big screen. I think when Avatar 2 comes out, I wanna see that on a big screen. But I think you're gonna see a ton of content is obviously being produced and it's not all gonna go to a theater going experience. So you're gonna see, I think different versions of this over the next five to 10 years. In case James Cameron is listening to this. So he officially agreed to talk at the time of, on this podcast at the time of Avatar 2 release. I'm just holding you to that in this recorded conversation. Also just super excited, both the movie and the director. I think there's something special about movies. They win Oscars, they're historic in nature. There's something about TV shows, even when they're epic like Game of Thrones, that they're forgotten much quicker in history. I don't know, maybe that's because we haven't had enough of them, but the De Niro performances and the Scorsese films, all the great films that kind of we think of throughout the generations that define generations are films. Is that just old school thinking? Is that always gonna be the case? I mean, look, to me, going in a darkened theater with a bunch of strangers and the lights go down and you go on this journey, there is something special and magical about that. And I think movies have been a part of our cultural fabric forever. And for some reason, Hollywood and America was uniquely positioned to do a great job with it. And not that there aren't great foreign movies, but far and away American movies dominate not only the world market, but and so whatever it is that we do well, or Hollywood does well, there's something in the water apparently. But I agree that I love movies and I will for the rest of my days. It's interesting how creators can move back and forth now as well. That used to be a complete no-no. You're either a movie guy or you're a person or you're a TV director and that's that. But those lines have completely blurred. And they're also blurring, I mean, they're blurring all kinds of lines. Like they're moving to TikTok and Instagram. And I know right now it seems ridiculous to consider that these one minute things could be considered even in the same realm creatively as a film, but maybe that changes over time too. Maybe experiences can completely become fluid in terms of their size. As long as they have some deep lasting impact on you as a human being, as a consumer. Look, to me, the whole thing is about either the moving image or even sometimes a picture will bring out an emotion, a reaction, something. So, short form is harder because you have less time to set things up and all that. But I'm sure there will be short videos and creators that come up with things. And if a moving image can get a reaction out of you and make you feel a certain way and stay with you or inspire you, well, that to me is just the next evolution of whatever it's gonna be between humans and cameras, et cetera. See, I think that's why we've talked offline about this. That's why I love robots is I think there's certain things in the short form with robots that immediately can bring out a feeling in people. There's something about our consideration of our own intelligence, of our own consciousness, of all the fears and hopes and the beautiful things about human nature, the dark things about human nature that somehow, especially legged robots bring out. Because we have both a fear and excitement towards that. Are these going to be our overlords, our gods that overtake humanity? Are these going to be things like horses or something like that, something that empower humanity? Like you don't know what to make sense of it. That's why they're super exciting. I agree. Speaking of robots and film, you've gone into traditional industries and disrupted them quite a few times. Was there, is there a system for deciding which industry is right for disruption? When you look at the world and see what are the big problems you would like to solve? Do you have a system of how you see which problems to solve? How do you look at the world? Yeah, well on the business side of that, so I have a holding company called Tulco, very imaginatively named. And part of that is literally every name ever is now taken, registered and all that stuff. So we're a holding company. What's a holding company? So instead of being a fund that has money flowing in and out of it, and there's what's called a vintage year, I raise capital and I agree to invest that capital for so long and then I give it back to you, which sometimes creates artificial time pressures and things like that. A holding company is more permanent capital. So the idea was behind Tulco was to buy almost always whole companies or majority stakes with great management teams in spaces that did not traditionally have a lot of innovation. And to have our labs group who were data scientists, AI practitioners, engineers, machine learning, et cetera, and to be able to bring that wherewithal to that company. So to provide them with the right capital and to provide them with access to technology that would be hard to individually recruit for that company. So I would say that the thesis was to look for industries that were large enough that hadn't traditionally had access to that type of technology or innovation and to try to look for companies that not only looked that part, but had management teams that embraced this and wanted to take that kind of journey. Yeah, there is quite a few industries like that, but that finding the industries and the management pair, because like those industries often have a lot of old school folks who don't. It takes quite a bit of work for them to leap into technology. I work quite a bit with the autonomous vehicles and just the automotive industry. Depending on the company, there's old school folks. It's like Detroit thinking versus like, what do you call it? I don't know, California thinking. Well, I think you have to look at the nexus of two things there. One is just plain old human behavior. If I am uncomfortable and this isn't a comfort zone for me and it's not something I have as a field of expertise, I'm gonna shy away from that. Especially if I'm successful and I feel good about myself and it's a big successful company or person or whatever it might be. And the second thing is that especially if you're a public company and you're being weighed and measured every quarter, you are rewarding the managers of that company to hit metrics and to be reliable and to say, hey, I'm counting quarter to quarter that you're gonna deliver what you say. It's difficult to say, you know what everybody, for the next two years, I wouldn't count on our financial projections at all. Because we're gonna reinvent what we're doing it's gonna work in the long run and you're gonna see that this was a really smart investment five to seven years from now. That's not the way capitalism is currently wired generally. Right? And a lot of, so again, if you reward managers with yearly bonuses and stock options based and tied to stock price and all these other things, you know, and then ask them to go break stuff, that's hard I think. So you're saying like, so the talk approach to this, the private investment is the best way or perhaps the only way to enable this kind of long-term innovation, investment taking big risks and investing in innovation. Well, look, we certainly are not, by any means the only one doing it. I'm just saying that when you think about big companies, the more successful, you know, that are in old line businesses and I hear people sort of talk about, well, why can't they just pivot? They recognize they need to be in the technology business well, cause it's hard. It's hard to steer a ship and turn it that big. And especially if it's not part of your DNA at that company. So, you know, I just think that what we tried to do is to enable management teams that know where they wanna go and to be patient with capital and also again, bring innovation to bear that they have access to. There's plenty of capital structures doing interesting things. That's one of the things I love about our country. This country innovates and this country invents things. And I'm constantly in awe of just the, you know, the human ability to innovate and to iterate. You know, I get to hang around some universities, including your old shop, MIT, and it's like- I'm still there. Yeah, still there. Still teaching there. Still teaching, but that place is like Hogwarts. I mean, it's just, it's inspiring. And certainly the energy in Silicon Valley, which now Austin, Texas, where we're sitting, has its own incredible ecosystem. So that's one of the things I love about America is the ability, and that really is, I think in the American DNA, to create things and invent things. And I just, I think that's invigorating. And I think that's even bigger than capitalism. Sort of the machine of how capitalism works. That's just human nature. Capitalism is just one of the ways to sort of make that human nature shine, I suppose. But it's like, you mentioned MIT. You know, there's a drive there to invent, to innovate. That's so purely human. That human spirit doesn't just come out of nowhere. That human spirit to sort of build something new. It's like that hopeful, optimistic spirit, especially in the engineering space. Like if you pay attention to the internet, like Twitter and all that kind of stuff, intellectuals and so on, there's a cynicism to when we talk about stuff, but there's an optimism to when we do stuff. And the doing part, when you actually build things, especially, like you care a lot about manufacturing too. Like you actually build physical products. That's where we truly shine. Yeah, no question about it. And I'm passionate about our country making stuff again. Doing our own manufacturing and making sure that we don't lose the ability, not just to create things intellectually and do the world's greatest blueprints, but actually make things here. Actual factories. Yeah, that's exactly right. How do we do that? How do we bring more manufacturing to the United States? There's a company that I have a big personal investment in called Rebuild with some folks that all went through the MIT school years ago. There's a good friend of mine named Jeff Wilkie, who used to be at Amazon. And we all felt the same way that America needed to make sure that it didn't lose its edge in that way. So it's a company that invests in American high-tech manufacturing. And I think the way that we do that is provide capital, provide training. To me, this is also fertile ground for good, sustainable, high-paying jobs. And we have to make it economically feasible to do that again here in this country and not to say to companies that again are being weighed and measured quarter by quarter, hey, this is three times as expensive to do it here, but you should do it here. We need to innovate and we need to create processes and companies and opportunity that balance that equation. And I think as we saw during the pandemic, I don't think in this day and age you can be an isolationist. That doesn't make any sense to me. But being self-reliant and self-determinant and making sure that you are never in a position as a nation that we can't do basic things because we're relying on supply chain in other countries. And whether it's we're not friends anymore or a natural disaster or a virus or something pops up, I think those are costs of doing business that we have to put into the calculus of being able to make things here. There's an extremely high cost to making supply chain resilient that we really have to consider. And so if you really consider that cost, it makes a lot of sense to invest, especially long-term, in building up manufacturing in a way where you're making most of the stuff in one place. Bringing it all, not all, but as much in as possible and building it almost from scratch here in the United States. I guess your thought is with innovation it's possible to revolutionize the way we do manufacturing. So reduce the amount of supply chain stuff and build stuff from scratch. Do high-tech manufacturing. So optimize all aspects of the manufacturing and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, and I think where technology is the most efficient is the human machine interface. It's not let's automate everything and have nobody work anywhere. For a long time, that's neither feasible nor desirable. But where we can enhance jobs and make that interface immensely productive with the right training and so forth, I think that's a worthwhile endeavor and something that's gonna be important to our country. Yeah, I mean, you know who you're talking to. I love human-robot interaction, human-machine interaction, human-AI interaction. So what do you think is the role of robotics in this high-tech manufacturing? Sort of like industrial robots, robotic arms, all that kind of stuff or even more complicated kind of robots. What do you think is the role of robotics? What do you think is the role of AI in this manufacturing future you're thinking about? Well, robotics to me is an extremely exciting field. I don't have the same expertise that you do. I have an adjacency, but not the depth of knowledge. I've never really delved deeply into it or made investments in it. But I think what's exciting about it is everything from doing jobs that are very dangerous for humans, enhancing the human experience. When you look at really repetitive labor, things that, you know, it might take away a job, but is it a good job for that person? Is spending 30 years doing something highly repetitious, is that a good experience in life? So I think, and then when you think about everything from military applications, you know, rescue, we're already seeing a bunch of those things. And then just lastly, when you talk about that human interaction with robots, when you start to have the combination, so you have some level of intelligence and interaction, I mean, that's why we always love the droids in Star Wars, right? I mean, it's exciting. It captures the imagination. And I think, look, many, many hours have been spent on debating artificial intelligence and the ramifications, if things go sideways and so forth. And I think those are all, you know, those are appropriate conversations to be having. AI is happening. I think it's actually happening slower than most people realize, because there are tasks that humans do every minute of every day, standing up without losing your sense of balance. I mean, these are really hard things, but I think there's enough investment, both in private industry as well as nation states now on artificial intelligence, that it is coming. So both in the software space, in the digital space, and in the physical space, so we talk about manufacturing, so industrial robotics, it's very true that even in the factory, even the tasks that you think are pretty basic, you know, the amount of small intuitive decisions that humans make is quite incredible. So we have to be kind of explicit about saying which tasks are actually really hard, and humans are just really good at them. And so on the flip side, in the digital space, with social networks, with recommender systems, with all kinds of personal assistance in terms of voice-based AI systems, all of that, there's opportunities there to find niches where AI can really have a transformative effect. I think one of the places that really haven't... This is where, like, you're worried to say stupid things, but I believe this very much, that when we have AI systems in the home currently, you have somebody like Alexa and Google Home and so on, they're kind of very basic servants. They tell you about the weather, they can play some music, they can turn the lights on and off, all that kind of like smart home stuff. I think there's a lot of value in systems that form relationships with us in the way that pets do. Dogs and cats, I don't know, cats, just for people who have cats, cats don't care about you. They really don't. They don't form any kind of relationship. I don't know why you have a relationship with them. It's one way. Anyway, sorry, I threw some shade. I'm just kidding, by the way. That's a basic kind of connection you have with another living being. Then there's also just friends. You have different levels of friends, acquaintances, you have lifelong friends, all that. That friendship you have, I really believe that there is some aspect of the human experience that is deeply enriched by interacting with other beings. And for systems, computing systems, artificial intelligence systems, in our world, to have the capability to engage in some of that, I think, is not just an opportunity to help people grow, become better people, but it's also just a good business opportunity too. And that hasn't really been explored enough. So that to me is really, that's a whole exciting space that I think will enable better industrial robotics. It will empower a better Facebook or a better social network, a competitor to Facebook that overthrows Facebook. So it'll create better technologies that currently don't have that human-robot interaction touch. So I don't know. That's super exciting to me. But that has to deal with the mess of human nature. The reason that most robotics people and AI people stay away from humans, they stay away from the human-robot interaction problem, is because humans are complicated. They're messy. They're hard to control. They're hard to predict stuff about. They're hard to make sense of or test repeatedly because one human can be drastically different from another human. And so to deal with that as a robotics problem is super hard. And so one of the questions is, which problems can you remove the human from consideration when you're trying to solve the problem? Elon Musk is an example of somebody who believes autonomous driving can remove the human from consideration. We can solve autonomous driving as a robotics problem. It's staying in the lane. When there's a red light, you stop at a red light. If there are humans in the picture like pedestrians, that's a ballistics problem. Just treat them as a moving object that has 90% probability, keeps moving in the way they were in the past few seconds, with some smaller probability they might stop or turn. Just do some basic models about them and you'll be able to do just fine. So I tend to believe that even driving has to consider the full messiness of humans. The game theoretic dance of chicken that we all do when we jaywalk, we look at the car, that car doesn't, that driver doesn't have the guts to murder me, so I'm going to walk in front of it and not look at the car. We do that kind of dance. And AI systems need to be able to do that kind of dance. In Talco, there's the labs. So there's a data science component, there's an AI component. So how do they go into a company and help revolutionize that industry? Well, there's different examples. So one of our companies, Figs, makes healthcare workwear, started by these two brilliant women, and early days helping to build the platform and recruit and make sure that everything that we did at the company embraced technology. And at the same time, they were obsessive about their customer, which is doctors, nurses, healthcare workers who are putting it on the line every day and obsessive about their product. And when you have those two things come together, you get the result that we did at Figs. We have a company called Acasher, which its AI lab and base is down here in Austin, Texas. It was an insurance, one of the largest insurance brokers in the world, and we did a deal with them and sold some of our insurance holdings. It was completely AI driven. And in that case, you basically put the team inside the company, because it's a massive company and we've gone into all kinds of things. So it just depends on the different situations. But the biggest thing was just to make sure whatever the company needed, they had access to the talent. Sometimes we'd build it, sometimes we'd help recruit for it. In technology, it's whatever works, right? There's no one way to do things. Well, Acasher is really interesting as an example. So insurance is a fascinating space. It seems like very ripe still for disruption across the board. It seems like a lot of the disruption has to do with almost the first dump step. We've been using mostly paper. It's not digitized. You have to basically create an infrastructure and a framework where everybody is using the same digital system, like databases, and just organize the data. It seems like that's a huge leap that basically can revolutionize major industries that still hasn't been done. Insurance is obviously the great example of that. And one of the things that struck me, the founder, CEO of Acasher, is a guy named Greg Williams. They're out of Grand Rapids, Michigan. And as we were looking at expanding our footprint in insurance, I met with a lot of insurance executives. And they would talk about technology, but Greg truly understood the power of what would happen across actuarial sciences, predictive analytics, and using machine learning to really run every aspect of your business, and then automating a lot of just the back office, tedious steps. And as you said, one of the things that was great for us, they already had a data collection system and department, so it was much easier to pivot. And I'm very excited about the future of that company. They're doing some pretty innovative, groundbreaking things. And those are the things that I like doing, right? Is that, yes, I want to make money. That's what that is. But at the same time, what did you do with your time on Earth? Did you do anything to leave any kind of mark that you did anything interesting? I can only speak for myself. There are many more ways to measure one's life, and I can only speak about how I think about things. I grew up poor in upstate New York with a single mom and watched her work a couple jobs and had to, from a young age, shovel snow and mow lawns and do all kinds of things to help her make sure the lights weren't turned off in our little place. And so that's just something that I've always been driven towards. And I have really eclectic tastes and interests, and it's just been an interesting journey. So help be part of and help enable some cool new creations across the board, like film, music, AI, manufacturing, just insurance, all the specific industries that you disrupted. Small Tangent, back to your childhood with your mom. Any memories kind of stand out, stick with you as something that helped define who you are as a man? Yeah, even though the university and college experience was not part of the family tree, and we had no connections, I didn't understand, I didn't know what a trust fund was or prep school. I didn't know what any of that was. But my mom from a young age would always say, you're going to go to college. There's no, if you choose to, and I think from a young age, that was just an expectation that I had and that she instilled, and the work ethic. I watched her, and then my grandmother was a janitor, a cleaning lady in a hospital for 50 years. And then I remember there were times of, I'm probably 10 years old, it's freezing cold out. And if I don't go out and shovel six driveways, we don't have enough money to pay the bill. So I don't know, I'm not a psychologist, so I don't know how that manifests itself in my life today. But I think the grit to say, I'm not in the mood to do this, I don't want to do this, but that's the work that needs to be done. And no excuses, not I'm a victim and I'm going to sit around and talk about, no, it is what it is, and you have to get done what you need to get done. And again, I think it's, you can never fully put yourself in someone else's shoes or experience, because I don't know what that is or feels like. But for me, those were two, I think, formative things that were important in my childhood. So that's pretty, the reality of life like that is pretty humbling. You still, you've been so exceptionally successful that it's easy to get soft now. How do you get humble these days? By getting up. I think for me personally, trying to push the envelope and being weighed and measured, right? That's why I always love sports too, there's a scoreboard. And I'm a huge believer in opportunity, meritocracy, all those things that I think are ideals that we want to aspire to. And I think that there's a lot of things I'm involved with right now that I just want to see if I can do it. I want to see if, and my own little mantra is cause the outcome, right? As much as you can, and at the same time have the humility and not to have the hubris or arrogance to say, I'm always going to cause the outcome. Because you'll get your ass kicked pretty quickly and humbled. The world and the universe is a big place with forces beyond. But I think, I also think a lot about being intellectually honest, which when I do university talks and so forth, I think that's a superpower. Because if you find yourself making decisions based on other people's expectations, based on places you don't want to go, but you feel like momentum is taking you there, I think that's a big problem. And there are people that go to our top universities and can't wait to get out and start their own company. And they want that pressure and they want to grind. And there are other people that are smart and talented, but just say, look, I don't want to lay awake staring at the ceiling wondering how I'm going to make payroll. I don't want that in my life. And I think if you can square that up and be okay with it and say, what makes me tick? What makes me happy? What puts me in a bad head space? Because there's a difference between challenging yourself and going against your nature. So that's why I think that being intellectually honest and being able to really sit down and go inside your own head and say, what am I good at? What am I not good at? How am I going to put myself in a position to be successful? Because I'm working on my weaknesses, but I'm not going to put myself career wise in a position where I'm just fundamentally going to have a hard time being successful. Yeah. Intellectually honest is a tricky one. And it gets, there's like levels to it too. Sure. Because some of the things I think about when you dream of doing certain kinds of big things, a part of intellectual honesty is to say several things. One is like, hey, the thing you're dreaming about, like one, the fact that nobody's done it probably shows that you're just a dreamer. This is not going to, like think clearly. The fact that it hasn't been done probably shows that it may not be the right path. And two is like, if you're dreaming about stuff, there's a certain point where it's like, hey, you haven't done it. Like, why haven't you done it already then? Like you have to be honest with yourself. You have to be ambitious. A lot of people work hard a long time for a dream, but you have to wake up and be like, all right, I've been at this for 10 years. Like with a startup, you launch a startup and you think, okay, one year, two years, three years, four years, pretty successful, but it hasn't exploded. Like you dreamed and you have to shut it down. You have to be intellectually honest there. At the same time, you might want to be like, step it up, lean into it. Say almost like the flip side of like intellectual honesty is like maddening ambition of just saying, fuck it, I'm going to go all in. But that is a kind of intellectual honesty saying like, you know, the big problem here is I've been kind of going and doing too many things. Maybe with this dream, you have to go all in on it. All those kinds of things. I mean, this is human experience. It's complicated. Yes, all human things are complicated. And I think there's a difference between being reckless and making well thought out informed decisions. If you're going to go all in, make sure you've measured twice, cut once, as they say. And one of my other favorite, I forget, many years ago I heard this saying and it stayed with me. It was never mistake, clear line of sight with distance. And so I think that the key, whether you're starting a business or you're thinking about leaving the company you're at and starting a business or just leaving for another job, any of these things is as much as you can. Right. And psychologists, I think, would tell us it's hard to be self-aware completely. Right. That's the rub. That if we were all completely self-aware of everything that we did in strength and weaknesses, it'd be a different world. But I do think you can work on that and at least challenge yourself to think about it and not be in a position where I'm going to medical school because that's what you do in my family. And even though I'm miserable doing it, things like that. So definitely you don't want to be sort of, because you don't think victim to conformity. They just go on doing the same thing over and over. That's right. But at the same time, is measure twice and cut once. It does feel like some of the biggest leaps taken are where you cut once and measure later. Is you leap in first. Sure. It's almost like a gut. I suppose that is a measurement, but you build up a good gut instinct of like what to do and then you just do it and then you figure out as it is the building the airplane as you're flying it. Right. Well, and I think each one of those instances that you could probably cite has its own unique circumstances. I don't have a deep biotech background. So if I suddenly stood up and said, I'm going to put everything I have into this idea, well, that's, you know, those are, right, it's game theory, right? What are the odds of success? If on the other hand, you know, you're brilliant in your field or you've seen some opportunity that you think is wide open and you're going to go for it and break stuff, that's great. You just want to wait. To me, always say like, how crazy is this on the spectrum of, you know, do I have any expertise? What is the downside if I fail? Right. You know, if you're at a certain point in life with young children and you've got a mortgage and whatever else, that is one circumstance versus I just got out of Stanford or I just got out of whatever and I'm going to go for it. It's just the whole thing, right? It is complex, as you point out. And sometimes you just want to have the right matrix in your head of decision making process to try to arrive at the right place. And even if you get close, that's where I think you say, you know what? The hell with it. I'm doing this. Yeah. I do want to ask you about one specific idea that sounds super fascinating that you're involved with recently. You led the $50 million seed round for a company called Colossal that is focused on de-extinction. This is funny relative to our connection and conversation about Jurassic World. They're seeking to restore lost ecosystems and use gene editing to restore the woolly mammoth to the Arctic tundra. How are they going to do that? Well, I met this fascinating guy at Harvard named George Church five, six years ago and found him to be incredibly smart, have an imagination. And he partnered up with a guy named Ben Lamb, who's an entrepreneur. And basically the press and to me the imaginative, you're capturing my imagination by telling me you're going to bring back the woolly mammoth and other extinct animals. And we'll see where that road leads. I was more interested in an investor in the things that they're working through around understanding genes and proteins and CRISPR and all these other things, because being adjacent to George Church and his team, as these things unfold over the next decade, I thought was the right thing to do. So people are important here, just like investing in people and seeing what the hell they come up with. Absolutely. I mean, you can look through history and great things are done by great people. Right. And companies, they end up over time becoming a logo and immediately what you think of them. But they started out with a person with an idea and a team that cultivated that and made that happen. And I think there are certain folks that are just immensely talented that if you can be around them, and I also know his and his team's ethics in terms of after spending time talking about where the lines are, people in other countries that may not have the same process, may not have the same checks and balances, are doing this and pursuing this regardless. So at least I felt like with George and Ben and their teams, they're also very responsible people. This is where the human side of things comes into play. I've interacted with a lot of really brilliant people in the technology space where you kind of, you know, there's a lot of ways to feel this out. You can ask them whether they kind of read literature, you can feel out how much they really understand about like human nature here. Like whatever the technology is, when it actually starts to play, interact with society at scale, like do they have an understanding or an intuition about how that happens? Some of that requires studying history. Some of that requires like just looking at the worst and best parts and events in human history to understand like, hey, it doesn't always turn out like everybody hoped the technology turns out. If a person has a depth of understanding about history, about human nature, then I think that's the right person to mess with some of this cutting edge stuff. You want Marcus Aurelius with a PhD from MIT. Exactly. Exactly. Just small tangent, but you mentioned having a conversation with Warren Buffett. You spoke really highly of him as an investor, as a human being. What about him do you admire? What insights have you drawn from him as a great investor yourself? Well, the afternoon that I got to spend with him, which, you know, something I'll treasure forever. Look, sometimes when you meet people, even that are immensely successful, you may decide that after 20 minutes or a half hour, oh, you were in the right place at the right time and that's fine. There are other people that are clearly different, special, and I don't care if you made them start from zero, would end up in a good place. It was an absolute privilege to spend the time with him. A couple of things that stood out in the conversation. He is incredibly intellectually curious and well read. I like how simplistic he likes to keep his thought matrix. Then also, instead of trying to outsmart the market, it seems like a simple axiom, but just look, good companies that are led by talented managers that are good businesses over time are going to get there. I'm not going to day trade. I'm looking for value. Then just on life stuff, and also his ability to take in and then use information was incredibly impressive. I had met him before, but I only spent one afternoon with him, but it's pretty incredible. One of the things that stuck out to me is we were in the middle of talking about Talco or investing or how we thought about it. I said, I'm trying to be smart about, and he stopped me and he said, Charlie Munger, his partner of many years, Charlie and I don't try to think of the smart thing to do. We try to think what's the dumb thing we could do here. I laughed and he said, no, I'm dead serious. We think about it from the standpoint of what could we do in this situation that later we'd be like, that was a really dumb thing to do. I actually thought that was, it got in my head and I still think a lot about that as I'm dissecting problems. That's a long-term thinking if you just avoid the dumb things or if you simplify, just focus on those simple steps, all it takes is just do that for a long period of time and you'll be successful. It certainly worked for him. That's all I can say. What about you? You've been a great investor yourself. How do you know when you judge people? Whenever I go to San Francisco, I was thinking of moving to San Francisco. That's why I decided to, after really giving it some thought, talking to people, decided to move to Austin. Everybody's dreaming big and they have big plans. It's actually, I don't envy the job of an investor of any kind because everybody has big dreams and it's hard to know who exactly, what idea is going to materialize, what team is going to materialize into something great. How do you make those decisions about people, about ideas? Well, if I had any kind of a lattice work on this, it absolutely starts with the people. I think the reason for that is your business plan is going to change. There's very few businesses I know of that say, we're going to make a widget in this location and 30 years later, we're successful and we just make a widget. That's what it is. Things happen. Today, they happen with such velocity that you have to be able to make hard decisions based on imperfect information. How are you going to calculate those answers? How self-interested are you going to be? What kind of ethics will you apply? What's your short-term versus long-term thinking? Are you able to give an honest assessment of a situation? Because the thing that you can count on is problems are going to happen. Things you didn't anticipate are going to happen. How pliable are you? How much elasticity is there in your ability to be successful? I think it's important when you invest in something that you both see, you understand the roadmap ahead and agree to it. It doesn't mean there won't be twists and turns, but you're not like, wait a minute, what did we do here? This isn't what was in the thing I signed up for. Then I think honesty and communication is a huge thing to me. I always tell people bidirectionally, if there's something going on, start the conversation with, Lex, we have a problem. Okay, now I'm sitting up, you have my full attention, we're going to talk about whatever it is. Bad news should travel faster than good news. Because it's going to happen, being in business with someone that is going to shoot you straight and sometimes say, I don't know. I don't know what the answer is. I got to go figure it out. That I can process a lot better than, look, I don't want you mad at me or disappointed or I can't handle not having success. We're just going to kick the can. I think especially in today's business environment, that's very, very dangerous. That's a bad sign, not just because it's good to communicate and be honest. If they're not willing to do that, then it goes back to the intellectual honesty. They're probably not also able to be brutally honest with themselves when they look in the mirror about the direction of the company. Look, I wasn't there, so I don't know. But I think if you unpack many situations that turned out negatively, most of the people, whether you're faking lab results, you have a biotech company, everybody's staring at Theranos these days. Do I think in a lot of cases, you're either the villain, like you started out saying, I'm going to screw my shareholders over and I'm going to be a liar. That isn't my experience. Most things are little incremental moves that you say, we're going to get this right next week, but today we got to make the presentation. We're going to just tweak things a little bit. That's a slippery slope. That's why I think from a standpoint of people, you want to go into the foxhole with folks that understand things are going to happen and I'm going to let you know about them and we're going to try to solve them together. Then just in terms of the idea, I always ask, okay, if this company executed the way... That's the other thing that always cracks me up about financials. Whenever somebody pitches you, inevitably they'll say, our projections are really, really conservative. I'm still waiting for somebody to come in and say, look, my projections are wildly optimistic. We'll never hit these numbers, but anyway, if this company did what it says and executes, does it matter? Does it move the needle enough? What are the things that uniquely position this company to be successful? You just have to be able to answer, I think, a number of those questions pretty crisply. At the end of the day, it's still a big risk. 500%. You're just trying to minimize the risk. Let me jump to another topic. You're an incredible human being that you're involved with this. Your band, Ghost Hounds, is touring with the Rolling Stones. Before we talk about your band, let me ask about that. What's that like, playing with the Rolling Stones? Surreal, just because they're my favorite band of all time. To me, the greatest rock and roll band. It's not even close of all time. To share the same stage, to be on tour, and to go out and get that energy from the crowd. Every night, you come off stage, and later when they go on, and you hear that iconic, ladies and gentlemen, the Rolling Stones. It's incredible. What's amazing to me about the band, next year will be their 60th anniversary. 60 years. It's hard to be around anything for that long, but making music and packing stadiums. What's amazing to me, they can play a two-hour set. It's not just that, oh, that's a hit, or you recognize it. Every song is an anthem. It's been amazing. We got to play with them in 2019, and when they ask us to do this again, it's just an absolute privilege. I asked you this offline, so I know you are a rock star. Just me, maybe I'm projecting. Do you get nervous, such a large audience with the Rolling Stones? It feels like there would be a lot of pressure. Yeah. You definitely don't want to screw it up. I think our band is tight-knit and all that stuff. I think that the individual nervousness dissipates when you go out as a group, and you're making music together. You're sort of, okay, we're all in this, and we're doing a thing. Even in sports, I always look at individual events like ice skating, or anything where it's just you out there alone. That's different than being with a team and nerve-racking. I'm sure if it was me with an acoustic guitar just going out, it would feel different. But absolutely, you get the right kind of butterflies, I would call it. Just the energy of playing music and having it be this relationship. Look, I get it. I've been to a ton of concerts where I'm like, look, can we just get to the band, please? But what's been great is just an amazing reception. We have this guy named Trey Nation as the lead singer who's just incredibly talented. He's just not only an amazing voice, but just has that charismatic thing. He's great. It's fun. What's it feel like to play in front of a huge audience? As a guitarist, are you lost in the music? You almost don't feel the audience. Does it add extra energy? Does it add extra anxiety? What does it feel like? Stadiums are interesting just because it's so big and cavernous. You want to protect your ears, so we use an in-ear system so that you are a little disconnected from the crowd. Because if you're playing that loud and you're standing in front of your amps without ear protection, that's bad. How are you monitoring the sound? The in-ear stuff, is that producing sound or is it strictly earplugs? No, it's producing the sound. It's like putting earpods in and listening to a song and you're playing to it. It's just us playing, but it protects your ears. But the energy from the crowd when they get going and get into it, which Knock on Wood so far has been amazing, there's nothing like it. It's just this bi-directional thing that happens. Music and sports were my first loves. It's very difficult to describe accurately because it's like no other feeling. Musically, how is it different than playing in a garage with the band by yourself practicing? Do you feel like you're creating something different when you got the guitar and the amp and just the sound dissipating out and everybody's listening? Listen, the first time we did it and there's nobody in the stadium, first time I ever played in a stadium, I'm out there in front and just hitting different chords and playing different licks. It's like I won a contest and I get to do this. What's different about it, and each venue is different. We went on the road with ZZ Top a few years ago, which was incredible. Love Billy Gibbons. He's a Texan. Incredible person and guitar player. But when you're playing in like 5,000 to 7,000 seats, you're right there with them, with the crowd. And then when you play in an arena, we toured with Bob Seeger on his last tour, which was cool. Played some shows with him. And again, the arena, they're all kind of packed on top of you and it's super loud, which was cool. Meaning the crowd is. Stadiums is a completely different animal. And it's just a completely different experience. Do you enjoy it versus like a smaller room? As a guitarist, as a musician, what's your favorite room to play? Any room that will have me. Look, I think arenas are the perfect blend, if I had to say, because it's loud and 20,000, 30,000 people, but like right up on you. The stadium, look, playing the stadiums with the Rolling Stones is just is going to go on the head marker somewhere is one of the more. I say this and I really mean it. My life is like a punked episode that just hasn't. No one's burst in yet. Yeah. But yeah, it's as cool as you think it is. So 60 years. How do you think Mick Jagger still got it? How do you know? How do you explain it? I gotta tell you. So I mean, the funny thing is whatever. Wherever there is excellence, people want to know how'd you do it? Yeah. Right. What's the secret? Not only is Mick Jagger and I think the songs that Keith Richards and Mick Jagger wrote together, if you go back and listen to the lyrics. It's just incredibly poignant and I'm just a huge Stones fan. So, but he works out like a maniac. Right. And it's it's that 10,000 hours thing. And it's that, hey, maybe I don't feel my best today, but I'm going to get up and do my routine and work out so that, you know, at his age, which, you know, I mean, you can look at people at different ages. Chronologically that are, you know, maybe we're both at this age, but I'm a lot older than you are, vice versa. And he just, I think it's the combination of raw talent and the ability. And he's very smart. Right. Like he's understands how to have interaction with the crowd and hold them in the palm of his hand and be an entertainer. But then on top of that, the reason he can at this age, run around stadiums and be just as energetic as he puts the work in. And that's one thing step that I think a lot of people miss sometimes where they want that magic trick. They want to know what's the shortcut. Most of the time the answer is there's no shortcut. Yeah, you have to work hard on the way there and work hard to stay on top. That's it. And sometimes not even like work hard. It's just like, it's like be a professional, which that involves like in his case, at his age, with the amount of stuff you have to do on stage and the way he does it. For two hours. You have this is a professional athlete, a professional athlete that has to do things that are probably designed for 20 year olds and 30 year olds. That's a dude or an older age, which means like what do you have to do? We have to probably probably has like a whole physical routine. Yes, they do diet, the whole thing. And it's hard. Look, if you want to do great things, you probably have to do hard things to get there. I'm not going to make you pick just stick on the stones for one more minute. But what are some great Rolling Stones songs that were impactful to you lyrically, musically, maybe something you like playing like air guitar. I don't know. Probably my favorites. I love sympathy for the devil. It's a very, I don't know, sort of Faustian. I love the lyrics. I love the how the almost a Voodoo beat just kind of builds throughout the song. That's that's always been one of my favorites. So in that song, he never mentions devil does it? No, wait, sorry. Like, you know, my name. Yeah, there's there's like a flirtation in the lyrics. It's kind of interesting. It's here's all the trouble I've caused along the way with you humans. And I just think it's really, really great musically builds really nicely. Yeah, it's it's like both fun and dark. It's cool. It's a It's a playful nature to it. It's that's very stones. The only they can pull it off because it's like playful, but it's also like dark and dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. Yeah. And give me shelter. It's just, you know, and to this day, when I listen to the studio version and Mary Clayton just comes on and sings that epic iconic part. And there's a documentary that was done about backup singers. Phenomenal. And it tells the story of that moment in that song with Mary Clayton. And it's just her voice and the way it unfolded. They got her out of bed at like 10 o'clock at night in LA. And she's like the Rolling Stones. And went in and just killed it. And I can't sing at all. I'm by ordinance not around a microphone. So I'm always in awe when someone can sing like that. But, you know, those are those are some of my my favorite Rolling Stones songs and painted blacks awesome. I mean, I could go on. Yeah, painted black is great. Again, a song that builds bad as I mean, it defines the whole generation. What made you pick up a guitar? What made you fall in love with the guitar? It's just the coolest instrument. Right. I mean, when you watched back then, you know, and I was kind of an old soul. I was listening at a fairly young age to Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Lightning Hopkins, BB King, and just the soulfulness. Thrills gone. Oh, my God. I mean, BB plays five notes and just kills it. And the emotion that it evokes. So I just was just in awe of the instrument. And, you know, I also there's there's always somebody around who's a musician that just picks the instrument up and can play. Right. And they're just so talented at it. And they can just listen to a record and play that that was never me. I never took formal lessons. I had to grind, you know, to just make it sound like I wanted it to sound. So both technically and ear. Everything was hard work. Yeah. I mean, I could hear it. And what they call, you know, you play. So my right hand, the rhythm side of it is that's probably, if I have anything, my strength. But there's something pretty amazing that happens when you get together with other people and play a song in that moment where it hits the pocket and you all kind of know it. And it just it's just such a cool feeling. And it was interesting growing up because I was again, I always had a collective interest. So I loved math and physics and science. So I had those friends and I was an athlete and played football and baseball and basketball. So I had my jock friends and then I had my music friends. And so it was it was just kind of that. And so when I was still living in Los Angeles and had legendary, I just missed playing. And so I put this band together and called it the Ghost Hounds because again, huge Robert Johnson fan and that legend of Robert Johnson selling his soul at the crossroads in exchange for his musical talent. You guys have that in one of the videos. Yeah. Such a cool video. Exactly. So I always I just thought like that's that's such cool lore. I just love the blues. So Robert Johnson would often would would talk about hellhounds on his trail. And so I always just thought, huh, what about Ghost Hounds? So that's I wish it were a more clever, deeper story. But that that's about it for the name. That's pretty deep. Robert Johnson is incredible. But you also talk about this, that you you connect to the storytelling of blues. So what makes a good story in a song like what what aspect of storytelling connects with you in song. So I'm a big lyrics guy, too. I love like deep lyric people like Tom Waits and the people that are like, you know, Leonard Cohen, like they're even Bob Dylan, they're like, obviously, yes, poetry. And then there's some people like the Rolling Stones there. It's like seemingly simpler, but it's still so much more to it. It's like less is often more. It still tells a strong story. Yeah. And there's there's certain people and Jagger and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are in this boat. Billy Gibbons. They just say things in a certain way. They're just cool. Right. It's just. And so, you know, I write our music and lyrics. I have to tell a story. I have to know the characters in the song. I'm not good at just writing some rhymes and having it match up to the right key and the right music. I have to understand like that's just me. And so I think that, look, if you have three or four minutes to tell a story, you have to be more efficient with your your use of language and you have to understand what you're building to, if anything, and evoke emotion and hopefully for those three minutes, get the listener to understand not only the point of the song, but where you're coming from. And to make you feel a certain way. There's a song that, you know, the audience seemed to like a lot on the new album called Good Old Days. And I wrote that because, especially during COVID and reflecting on what what normalcy looks like and what it what happens when you're cut off. I just was kind of taken with this idea of that when you sit around and reminisce with friends. Oftentimes, it's not just like some big event happened. It's remember that summer, we'd go up to the lake all the time and it's who you were with. And at the time, it probably seemed pretty pedestrian. Right. Just seemed like kind of a normal day. But it was the company you were keeping. It was the time in your life. It was whatever it was. And I just kind of struck me that right now we're doing stuff that you're going to reminisce about later that seems kind of ordinary. Be like, man, that was such a great time. So the idea is be in the moment and all that stuff. But these are the good old days. And enjoy it and soak it in and kind of be present for it. Yeah, it's a great perspective to take on the present because we are in the thing that we'll remember. We're living through the thing we'll remember. And sometimes the things we'll remember is the simple stuff, the little stuff. Outside of Keith Richards, who is the greatest ridiculous question, but just indulge me. Who is the greatest blues guitarist of all time, rock guitarist of all time? Well, you got a little bit of a hybrid with Jimi Hendrix, right? Because he played the blues and he played rock and roll. So I think most guitarists would say Jimi Hendrix is pretty ridiculous. That probably for me, I'm a huge, huge, huge Hendrix fan to play. Even to this day, I don't care technology, pedals, whatever, he just somehow fused with the instrument. I can't be sitting here in Austin, Texas without mentioning one of the great guitar players of all time and Stevie Ray Vaughan. See, that's how I know you're like a rock star. You're sucking up to the audience. Well, no, you have listeners all over the place. But Stevie Ray Vaughan is another one of those. Yeah, he's incredible. Just blows me away. And then with the older guys, B.B. King, Hubert Sumblin, Clapton. Yeah. I saw him on his last tour and just walked out on my just like unbelievable how he still sounds. And both electric and acoustic. Just so strange. Yeah, he's a master. Absolute master. And the greatest storyteller, you mentioned Bob Seeger. That's an interesting one. He almost doesn't get enough credit, I feel like, for how great he is. Obviously, he's super famous. No, he's in his voice. I also had the privilege of getting friendly with John Fogarty and CCR fame. He's another one that's just the way he phrases things. And you just look at the catalog of stuff he wrote. Amazing talent. I read Bruce Springsteen's book. I'm a fan, but after reading the book, it was really... You go back and listen to his lyrics and the way he pours himself out is pretty incredible. And then again, with the old blues guys, I just think the emotion they could get out of playing like this, staying on the one, right? Just playing the same rhythm. John Lee Hooker. You listen to Manish Boy by Muddy Waters. And it's just... There's something so... It just draws me in every time. And the emotion they're able to get out of things. And I'm also a huge Chuck Berry fan. I just think that sound is... I love it. Do you know how to play Johnny B. Goode? I do. I do. That's good. Maybe one of the great moments, at least of my childhood, was back to the future and watching Michael J. Fox plug in. And then at the end, play at the dance to save his parents with Johnny B. Goode. Pretty awesome. Yeah, the guitar is so much more than a musical instrument. It feels like... It's like the... In the 20th century, it's like the car. It defines so much of Hollywood, so much of a generation of what it means to be... I don't know. What it means to be a man, what it means to be a human in America. It's fascinating. It's emblematic to me of a certain type of music. I made a documentary years ago called It Might Get Loud with Jimmy Page, The Edge. I highly recommend that everybody watch that documentary. It's an incredible celebration of the guitar. Yeah, it says Jimmy Page, Jack White from White Stripes. The Edge. And The Edge from U2. Okay, all right. Well, now you have to tell the story of that one. Because how the heck did that all come together? Because it's so fascinating. Such different musicians all coming together, talking about their story, talking about how they approach the music, and also playing together a little bit in this casual kind of setting. Well, look, one day I came downstairs and the Rolling Stone magazine is sitting there and it was the 50th... It was the 50 top guitarists of all time, their list. And then I had some other financial report with video games and the top video game at the time was Guitar Hero. And then there was a third thing, I can't recall it, but I just... And I said to myself, what is it about the guitar that is so central to the rock and roll, whatever you want to call it, why is that the symbol? And I said to myself, I want to ask Jimmy Page why he picked up the guitar, because he's Jimmy Page, right? And so I called a friend of mine, Davis Guggenheim, who had directed Inconvenient Truth, and I think still is, but at the time was the biggest documentary ever. And I called Davis and I said, look, I have this idea, I want to make this movie about the guitar, about different eras and styles and whatever, but I've never made a documentary. I don't know how to do that. And so I was just looking for advice. And thankfully, because he's one of the best documentarians ever, Davis is like, you know what? I can't get this out of my head. I'll direct it, which was amazing. And we wrote three names down that represented different eras and different styles. Rarely do you go three for three, but it was those three guys. And it was just such an incredible experience to sit there and get to know Jimmy Page. And he was like Gandalf, man. He was like always Jimmy Page. Yeah, yeah. That was so cool to see him. Gandalf was good. There's like a wisdom, there's a calmness to him compared to like the restlessness of Jack White. I mean, that combination was just fascinating. It was one of the coolest experiences ever. And one of the things, there was a moment where Jimmy, he was going through his guitar case and he had the double neck from stairway to heaven and he handed it to me. And I was like, mm-hmm. I mean, it's like somebody handing you X caliber or something. Amazing experience. And The Edge, one of the kindest human beings you'll ever meet in your life. Just an amazing person. And I think you hit it right in the head with Jack is he's got that energy and constantly pushing himself. But it's hard to believe it's been, I think, 10 or 11 or maybe even 12 years since it came out. After watching it, I realized how much it was needed. And I was almost surprised it didn't already exist. It was like, yeah, the guitar wasn't quite celebrated explicitly. We almost didn't acknowledge it. How important it was culturally. It's kind of amazing. And the way it closed from the song, The Wait, it's called The Wait by the band. That's because they didn't want to go home. We were shooting on a Warner Brothers soundstage for three days when we called it The Summit where the three of them came together. And the two things I'll never forget is when Jimmy starts to play the riff from Whole Lotta Love, Edge and Jack ceased to be rock gods or whatever and had the same 15-year-old kid feeling that I did. You could see in their face. And then at the end, they're like, hey, can we play? We just want to, we don't want to go. Can we just play something acoustically? So we printed out the lyrics. That's what they wanted to play. And they just sat there and sat on those couches and just such a good way. And yeah, incredible. What's your guitar rig set up like? You have a few guitars. First, let's just put on the line. So what's better, Les Paul or Strat? Well, I'm not going to get into what's better because I'm sure that'll start a flood of whatever. For me. I'm going to say it's Strat. All right. Well, I'm a Les Paul. My main instrument is a Les Paul. But I, okay, okay. Let me just put it on the table. I'm speaking as somebody who literally, I don't think I've ever actually strummed a chord on a Les Paul. So I've been, maybe I'm- So you're uninitiated. Exactly. So I don't speak from experience, but it's probably because of Hendrix. I'm so deeply influenced by Hendrix that I just kind of followed in his footsteps and clapped in and so on. The amazing thing to me is if you look back at Leo Fender and what the Gibson guitar company and Les Paul did in the fifties, those are still the shapes and the perfect thing today. Right? The Strat and the Telecaster and the Les Paul. And it's, they got it right way back then. So I have my main guitar, you got to name your guitar. So my main guitar is named Hazel and it's a 59 Les Paul. And there's something magical in that year, like a Stradivarius. And they're just, there's something different about them. So I play that and then I play it through sort of my main rigs, either a 59 Fender Twin or a 65 Marshall. And then when we're on the road now, because when you use older vintage stuff, you just got to be super careful with the tubes and everything. It has to be reliable. So very nicely, the guys from 2ROCK sent me some of their amps and they're really, because I don't use any new stuff, but the 2ROCK stuff is pretty great. So that's actually what I'm using. It gets close to the sound that you like with the Marshall. Yeah. Yeah. It's new and reliable. So that's what I'm using on the road right now. Do people use emulation? Do they use software? Is it still? They do. I personally don't. I go, you know, I don't have many pedals. I use a Clon, an old, you know, vintage Clon straight into the amp and that's it. Just as old school as possible. Is there other cool guitars you have that kind of stand out? I have a bunch of what they call Blackguard Telecasters from the 50s, which are pretty great. What are those? Blackguard Telecasters? Yeah. So it just, you know, it's in the 50s. Oh, they actually legit have a Blackguard. Blackguard. But they're incredible. So. What's the color of the Telecaster itself? Most of them are yellow with black and then they got into different configurations. But there's something. I have a 51 Telecaster that I play in Open G and in songs with Open G that just, again, there's something, you know, and I'll take all the help I can get in terms of making it sound great. So I'll try to find the magic ones. What's your writing process like for the music and the lyrics? Is there, do you have to go to the mountains? Is there whiskey involved? What do you have to do? Or do you just write a little bit whenever you have a moment of free time? I'm a boring guy because I don't drink. I don't, I just, I figure I can screw things up plenty on my own without adding anything. That's a good call. But, you know, for me, it either starts with a riff, just something that I think is an interesting, you know, riff or tone that I can kind of sink my teeth into a little bit. And a lot of times I'll write a title and love a title and then start to backfill. Oh, cool. So the title is almost like an idea. Yeah. Like this is where I want to be and then start kind of writing it out. And again, I just have to know, am I writing from a character's point of view? Am I writing about someone or something, you know, is like the narrator and, you know, what is this person? Are they happy? Are they sad? Are they, where are they in life? I don't know if all that like great writers, I'm sure would say, why don't you just write? You don't need all that. But that's for me, that's my process. I'm not so sure about that. And I bet you quite a lot of writers have created a world in their mind before they even put the simplest of words down. So yeah, there's quite a lot to that. What's your favorite song to play? Is there some favorite ones you go to? Both play and kind of, I'm sure you love singing. No, no, no, no. I'm neither talented nor do I have the desire. And I think, you know, if you come see the show, you won't see a microphone anywhere near me. But do you, I mean, do you hear like when you're thinking about lyrics, do you hear the idea of the words? 100%. And especially what's great, you know, with Trey is I write for his voice. And then we have these amazing backup singers that are just, and I can hear all of it. I just can't do it. And so I'd say to, of our stuff, there's a song called Half My Fault that I play in Open G that just, I love playing the song. I love that energy. And then there's, we have a new blues album coming out. And there's a song called Baby We're Through, and it just stays on the one. And for non-musicians, that means like in a lot of rock and roll and blues, it's what's called a one, four, five progression from your kind of root note. And you would hear, if you're a non-musician, if you heard it, you'd be like, oh yeah, that's a lot of songs. And this song just stays on the same groove, like La Grange or Shake Your Hips or any of those songs. And it's just got this unbelievable energy and it's fun to play. But I have to keep the same rhythmic thing going for the whole song. With that simplicity, I mean, the personality of the song can really shine. I mean, Trey's, I mean, that guy, really cool. It just comes through. I mean, I guess you need that from a lead singer. You gotta have that. And my other guitar player, Johnny Bob, he's a phenomenal, I mean, like a legitimate guitar slinger. We probably split the leads 70-30. And he is just, there's times sometimes I look over at him and I'm like, I'm being a fan right now, because what you just laid down is pretty good. From a lead perspective, what's the most fun thing to play? What kind of stuff do you like? Do you like slow? Do you like, I mean, if you feel like thrill is gone. So if you look at B.B. King, sometimes one note just bending the shit out of that. What do you call that? Vibrato? Yeah. If I'm going to play the lead, it's a certain kind of feel. Slow blues is probably my favorite to play or something that's got a little more of that Chuck Berry drive where you can be rhythmic in the lead. I can't, the shredding thing that those guys do is that's not my... I was actually always able to do that really well. Like you mentioned people that pick up fat, like maybe it's the classical piano training. I could play super fast on guitar, super technical. But to me, the hardest thing and my favorite thing is it's just, it's probably less to do with the guitar. More living on life that's worth playing a guitar for. It's like a certain kind of emotion that you can put into the notes and that has to do with bending notes. Well, like bending notes is a whole other art form of... I worked surprisingly a long time on Comfortably Numb. So David Gilmore does a lot of bending and they're simple. They sound simple, but the dynamics of them to express like a buildup in the way it's held and there's often a vibrato at the top for a bit. It's almost like a sigh and a sigh of relief and the buildup. That's an art form for him that's hard to get right. It's not just playing a note, playing a note, playing a note. It's in that dynamic movement of a note that so much can happen. That's where the blues just happens to. Look, I'm a huge Freddie King fan too. You listen to these guys and you sit there and they're like, man, you're playing in a small range on the neck. But it's like, I know the notes you're playing and I'm playing them too, but not like that. Gilmore is certainly one of those guys that's incredible guitar player. In yet another chapter of an amazing life, you love football. You play football? Yes. What positions do you play? Wide receiver. Wide receiver. Awesome. So maybe we can talk a little bit about your love of football and the fact that you are part owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Yeah. So, I mean, where do we start? We start at the beginning. Let's start at the end. Why the Steelers? What attracted you to the, first of all, I think, not to be controversial, but one of the best uniforms. The best uniforms in football in terms of just like black and gold. Just. D-Cal only on one side. Yeah, it's great. Yeah, the helmet. Look, I've bled black and gold since I was a little boy. I grew up in upstate New York and the first football game I ever saw was the Steelers in the Super Bowl. As a really little kid and it just, I mean, Jack Lambert and Joe Green and Franco Harris and those guys were like came down from Olympia, Mount Olympus or something. And I just was enamored with the team. And because we only had three channels, the only time I'd get to see them is occasionally when they were the game of the week or something. And I just loved to me what they stood for, the toughness and they played football, you know, the way that I thought was great. I was a huge Jack Lambert fan, our Hall of Fame linebacker who just intimidated everybody. So that was like the, that was the decade of the Steel Curtain. I mean, arguably one of the great sort of defensive of in football history and also one of the greatest football teams period of in football history. I've been a lifelong fan and was very fortunate to meet Mr. Rooney. The Rooney family started the team in 1933, got to know him and just was asked to be part of the ownership group. I think it was the end of 2007. First year as part of the group in 2008, we won the Super Bowl and it was like beyond surreal and just beyond surreal. And you know, it's amazing to be able to do. I mean, the Rooney family is one of those most revered in sports for the way they conduct themselves. Mr. Rooney passed away I think five years ago now and we lost him, but was a champion, helped build the league. I mean, put the league as we know it together. More importantly, was a civil rights champion who created what we now call the Rooney rule to make sure that we're being fair about giving minority coaches a chance to get hired. And just, just as one of the most kind and amazing human beings I ever, ever met. It's incredible what sport does, like to bring out the best in people, to give people hope, to inspire people. There is something about football that has all the elements of a great sport. It's the teamwork. It's the sort of the combat aspect of it. It's like it's the purity of it. It's of like strength and power and speed and all the elements of like last minute close calls required to win the game. And where referee decisions, of course, that's essential for a sport can screw up the whole thing. Just got all of it together. I think just, I don't know, it gives the drama and the triumphs are just beautiful. Like some of my favorite memories. I don't know if it's an accident or this is common with people is just with friends watching football and connecting over that. Yeah, well, it's look, it's an incredible game because there's nowhere to hide, right? You're out there on the field. It, you know, it's a great game that requires not only all those attributes that you said, but it's incredibly complex game. So if you don't know what you're looking at and you don't understand how complex defenses are trying to disguise what they're doing, offenses are trying to overcome that and you can set up one play the entire game. But a team that plays well together, right? Knows their plays inside and out, knows their assignments inside and out, can overcome and beat a more physically gifted team because of that, you know, work that, that aspect of working together. And one of the things that I always loved about sports is just you're out there. There's a set of rules and there's a scoreboard. So at the end of that game, it says, and you can make excuses about the refs or this happened or that happened, but you know, at the end of the day, did you go out and compete? When you went out and were a competitor, how did it work out? Right? And the simplicity of that and the purity of that is something that I always have been drawn to. What about the business of sort of owning a team or putting together a team or trying to like build up a team that's going to be a great team? Like, what are some interesting aspects that people might not realize that you can carry over from all the other experience you have in business? I think the hardest thing about professional sports right now, it's individuals getting paid money to play a sport, which is different than, it's certainly different than amateur. And the decisions that are hard is when you get to know somebody who's a player on the team and either they're at the end of their career or you need to go in a different direction and that person who's done everything that you've asked, whatever the coaches have asked of that person, and you get close to them. And when they have to be traded, released or whatever happens, it's, you know, that's sad. And being able to stand back and in some ways be dispassionate and not be a fan, right? I'm on the Baseball Hall of Fame board and one of the guys that's on the board of me is Jerry Rynsdorf and I think it was Jerry who said, you know, if you act like a fan, you'll be sitting with them, which I thought was kind of funny. Well, I got to push back on that a little bit. As a by way of a fan asking a dumb question. Okay, let me just give some examples. It's very common in sport. It's funny you said this example of like certain great players going to another team right at the end of their career. And it always makes me sad. It almost makes me want to wish that you kind of retired right there. From a perspective of just like, do you ever as a owner, but just in that space, think about like the Steelers in the full arc of human history. So not like as a business. Okay, this question might be absurd. I don't have to think about it as a business. I'm a minority owner so I can think about it almost as a fan, but I'm sorry, go ahead. Yeah, that's what I mean. I suppose this is a dumb question to think of. Like of a business in that way, not just investment, but like, like legacy of like what footprint would you leave on this world. That is one thing that I can say unequivocally and I only have the experience that I have. But one of the things that I'm so proud of about the way the Steelers conduct themselves is, and that's the Rooney family. That's the legacy of the Rooney family is asking constantly about what's right for the league, what's right for the players. You know, what's the right thing to do here? And that's something that I would hear Mr. Rooney say all the time. So I think that legacy is important because ultimately the team belongs to that city, right? Belongs to those fans and you know, the owners are the custodians of that. So I think, and when you realize what sports teams mean to the fans, the memories that it creates, the bonds that it creates, it's a, you know, it's a responsibility. And I think that you do have to think beyond the, you know, certainly not just dollars and cents, but just sports is a very big deal in our society and it has to be, I think, held to a standard that's not just, well, were we profitable this year? That's, there are other businesses for that. It is certainly a business. I don't mean to romanticize to the point that it's not, but to me it's more than that, or at least my experience has been that it's more than that. It's a source of meaning for millions of people. And you see that most like during COVID, for example, when there's so much desperation, so many people losing their jobs, so many people having to deal with the uncertainty, what the future holds. That's right. There's something about sports that just unites us that again, the tragedy and the triumphs of sport, of uniting, of gathering together with your friends, with family, shared experience of over like this, yeah, over just team, over rooting for your team, for your city. And the access, again, as I alluded to, we didn't have anything when I was growing up, but I would pour through the box scores. I was a huge Yankee fan and Steeler fan. And feeling some ownership of that, right, that I could read the box score and relive what they did and occasionally see them on TV and feel like I was part of that celebration when they won and everything. It's a very powerful thing. You've been exceptionally successful in a bunch of avenues and a bunch of efforts. What advice would you give to a young person today? A high school student, a college undergraduate that's thinking about career, maybe advice, not about just career, but about how to live a life they can be proud of. We talked earlier about intellectual honesty and to me, that's the first step of just saying to the best of your ability, who am I and what's important to me and what do I want to do and accomplish? If you can start with that and develop some sort of rules-based philosophical, here's what I'll do, what I won't do. And that way you can be flexible and pliable and you're going to need to be, but if you still have a compass that tells you, hey, at least I know this is the path I'm going to take, I think that's very important. The rules you're referring to, the principles, that's kind of like underlying integrity. So knowing what lines you don't cross on this path. That's exactly right. Because if you have those absolutes, there are many decisions that come into focus very quickly, right? Because, hey, that's not for me. Or, hey, I'm willing to do whatever it takes to do X, Y, and Z. And it has to do with the thing you were talking about. It's kind of interesting. You mentioned earlier in the conversation about slippery slope and that's how often it happens. Like how the slipping into unethical behavior happens. It's a slippery slope of little adjustments. You put stuff off. And I've been fortunate to not have to encounter these moments very much in my life, but I still encounter them. That's what integrity, I think, looks like. As the slippery slope is happening, those little things, without drama, without making a show of it, making a decision that stands behind your principles and just walking away. Yeah. And besides the big ideas, I'm going to change the world. I'm going to innovate. I'm going to do all those other things. I also start, if I'm giving any advice, which we can debate whether or not I should be giving advice. But just in terms of, well, let me start with this. Are you a good friend? Can you be counted on? Do you do what you say you're going to do? Yeah. Are you accountable to what you sign up for and do you hold others accountable? What does all that look like? And then I think it's being as intellectually curious and well read as you can be. We live in a world that is designed to distract you. And being able to sit with your thoughts or go on a walk and think deeply about something and not just surface area. You text me, I text you back, and we decide the fate of the world based on a couple of text messages or something. You don't want to lose touch, I think, with being well read and understanding and standing on great thinkers' shoulders and learning from those works. And then I also think that there's resiliency and then there's grit. And I heard someone say one time that those are slightly different. I know that there are all kinds of challenges in life that are tragic, that are unfair. There's no question that's the world we live in. But for me personally, to try as much as possible not to be in the victim mindset, because unfair things are going to happen. And we all want to live in an idealistic, just world. That should be what we aspire to. I haven't seen that yet. I haven't experienced that yet. But yet you still have to function in that world. So I think that that resiliency thing is very important. And then putting yourself out there, because if you play scared and you're always afraid to fail, this is probably a dumb way to get to the end of the podcast. But there are times, especially on Mount West, I love the big sky out in Montana, Idaho, places like that. And when you look up at night, it's almost like I've never seen anything like this before, because there's no light pollution, so to speak. And sometimes when I look up the most daunting problems that I'm experiencing, I'm like, those things have been there for a billion years or whatever, and I'll be gone and it doesn't... The most famous person on earth, 200 years ago? Eh. So it's pretty fleeting. And so make sure you have a good journey, and especially coming out of COVID, I think telling people that you care about them and maintaining and cultivating your friendships and relationships, and they're not just transactional. And making sure that someday when you're laying there, you can say, yeah, I was a good family member. I was a good friend. I was someone that could be counted on. I think all those things go into the mix of however you want to take the journey. So when you look up to the stars, do you think about that quickly approaching end of yours? Do you think about your own mortality? Do you think about your death? Are you afraid of your death? I'm a huge fan of Stoicism. I read a lot of Stoicism. I think Ryan Holiday's done a great job of bringing some of that back into the forefront. It's just really thought provoking to me, and rings, a lot of it rings, just hits me and says, I think that's right. And that Momento Mori thing, which is, hey, we're all going to die, so you should contemplate it. There's a finality to this thing. And so I think if you can rightly frame that between fretting about it every day and being afraid and being so laissez faire that you think you're going to live forever, it'll influence some of the decisions you make. It will influence the way you attack things and hopefully the way that you live your life. So yes, I wouldn't say I obsess over it, and I wouldn't say it's omnipresent, but because I read a lot of Stoicism and just I think it's right to pause and say, who knows, right? There's going to be an expiration date. And if it happened tomorrow, have I done the things I wanted to do? And am I the person I wanted to be? And I think it's important along the way to check those things. Yeah, I tried to make sure that I actually visualized this, that I'm okay dying at the end of the day, at the end of each day. Like, if this is the last thing I do in my life is talking to you. Oh, good Lord. I'm happy. I know you're joking, but I'm happy I get to live the life I do. And I think, Memento Mori, I think the Stoics have it right. And you have it right in saying, meditate on death enough to remember that this ride ends pretty quickly to help you appreciate every day and the people you love, the people close to you. And the cool shit that you're doing in your life, the cool shit you're creating. And the fact that you, Mr. Thomas Tall, are playing with the motherfucking Rolling Stones tomorrow. You are the man in so many disciplines, so respected, so successful. It's truly an honor. You sit down and talk with me today. Thomas, thank you so much for showing up in Texas and for talking on this silly little podcast. It's great, man. I'm a huge fan of the show and have had a great time hanging with you and really appreciate it. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Thomas Tall. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones. You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes, you might find you'll get what you need. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"un_corpus\",\n          \"enron_emails\",\n          \"sms\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"formality\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"educational\",\n          \"informal\",\n          \"formal\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"written\",\n          \"spoken\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I really believe that. I think worrying about a \\u201ctarget audience\\u201d can make you too preoccupied with things that don\\u2019t matter. You need to be thinking about emotion.\\n\\nEmotion plays no matter what audience you\\u2019re writing for.\\n\\nSecond, the term \\u201ctarget audience\\u201d puts you in a box. If you say you\\u2019re going to write blog posts for freelancers in their 20\\u2019s, then every single blog post, to you, better be for freelancers in their 20's.\\n\\nWhat if you want to write about a relationship you once had, though?\\n\\nYou can\\u2019t. You got to write to freelancers in their 20\\u2019s. It gives you no freedom to dabble, and that can get really draining as a writer.\\n\\nThird, most folks only have three or four topics they really want to write about anyway. For me that\\u2019s travel, writing, life lessons, and relationships. These are my four topics. You\\u2019ll never read a cooking article from me. I don\\u2019t care about that.\\n\\nIf you free yourself from boundaries as a writer, you\\u2019ll arrive at your target audience organically. Who is my target audience? People like me, I suppose!\\n\\nFourth, too much emphasis on \\u201ctarget audience\\u201d can dehumanize you to your audience. What makes Shannon Ashley so endearing for me is the fact that she writes such personal sh*t.\\n\\nThat humanizes her. That makes me want to read her more, no matter what she decides to focus on, because I love her and want to support her.\\n\\nIf I just gave you more freelancing tips every blog post, that\\u2019s fine, but I\\u2019m not anything more than a teacher to my audience. By writing more personal stuff, I become something much more. I become not only helpful, but relatable. I become less of a teacher and more of a friend.\\n\\nAnd who do you want to hang out with more?

You've got no heroes. The whole thing comes down. Who's left standing? Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism. And no, no, you will not have the entire landscape deracinated. And then the worst ideas tried again. The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray, author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender, Race and Identity, and his most recent book, The War in the West, How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason. He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker who points out and pushes back against what he sees as the madness of our modern world. I should note that the use of the word Marxism and the West in this conversation refers primarily to cultural Marxism and the cultural values of Western civilization, respectively. This is in contrast to my previous conversation with Richard Wolff where we focused on Marxism as primarily a critique of capitalism and thus looking at it through the lens of economics and not culture. Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite of each other with very different perspectives on how we build a flourishing civilization together. I leave it to you, the listener, to think and to decide which is the better way. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray. You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West, which in part says that the values, ideas, and history of Western civilization are under attack. So let's start with the basics. Historically and today, what are the ideas that represent Western civilization? The good, the bad, the ugly. I actually don't get stuck on definitions precisely because as you know, once you get stuck on definitions, there's a possibility you'll never get off them. Yes. I'd say a few things. Firstly, obviously the Western tradition is a specific tradition, a specific tradition of ideas, culture, well known to be perhaps easily defined by the combination of Athens and Jerusalem, the world of the Bible, and the world of ancient Greece and indeed Rome. Effectively creates European civilization, which itself spawns the rest of the Western civilizations, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. And others. But these are the main countries that we still refer to as the West. So there's a specific tradition and all the things that come from it. My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say, you know when you're not in it. So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai, you know you're not in the West, somewhere else. You know you're not in the West. When you're in Tokyo, somewhere extraordinary, but you know you're not in the West. Obviously there are, let's say borderline questions like is Russia in the West? Which I sort of leave open as a question. Possibly if you were placed into Moscow blindfolded and you woke up and you couldn't hear the language or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like, would you, would you guess you were in the West or not? I think I was somewhere near it. Getting closer. I mean, you know, it's also asked the question, doesn't it, whether it's European. And I think the answer to that is not really, although massively influenced by Europe, but and times wanting to reach towards it at times wanting to stay away, but a part of the West, possibly, yes. But anyway, it's a very specific tradition. It's one of a number of major traditions in the world and because it's hard to define doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Are there certain characteristics and qualities about the values and the ideas that define it is, is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure? Yes. I mean the rule of law, property owning democracies and much more. I mean, these are of course things that were ended up being developed in America and then given back to much of the rest of the West. I say there are other perhaps more controversial attributes I would give to the West. One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which is not shared of course by every other culture. The late philosopher George Steiner said he could never get out of his head the haunting fact that the boats only seemed to go out from Europe. They didn't, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists, the people who wanted to discover other civilizations and indeed even resurrect ancient civilizations and lost civilizations. These were scholars that were always coming from the West to discover this elsewhere. By contrast, there were never boats coming from Egypt to help the Anglo-Saxons discover the origins of their language and so on. So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which can be said to be a Western attribute, although it of course also has, one should immediately preface it, some downsides and many criticisms that can be made of some of the consequences of that interest because of course it's not entirely lacking in self-interest. So it's not just the scholars, it's also the armies. The armies, and they're looking to gain access and control over resources elsewhere. The markets. And hence the imperial imperative. Exactly. To conquer, to expand. Although that itself of course is a universal thing. I mean, no civilization I think that we know of doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors where it can. The Western ability to go further, faster certainly gave an advantage in that regard. Do some civilizations get a bit more excited by that kind of idea than others? Possible. It's possible. But you could say it's the Western civilization because the technological innovation was more efficient, doing that kind of thing. Absolutely. But maybe it wanted it more too. Well the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot and did terribly well for many centuries. One shouldn't forget that. As did others. I'd also say by the way, and again it's a very broad one, but it's worth throwing out there, I think self-criticism is an important attribute of the Western mind. One that as you know is not common everywhere. Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics to become rich. So you know, criticism is a negative sounding word. It could be self-introspection, self-analysis, self-reflection. And it can be what you need. You know, and in the Western system I'd argue that one of the advantages of the system of representative governance is that where there are problems in the system, you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means. We listen to arguments, most famously in America in the late 20th century. The civil rights movement achieved its aims by force of moral argument and persuaded the rest of the country that it had been wrong. It's not common in every society by any means. So I think there are certain attributes to the Western mind that you could say are, they're not entirely unique, but they are not as commonplace elsewhere. What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry of power, most visible, most drastic in the form of slavery, for example? Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery. I don't regard it as being a unique Western sin. It's rather hard to think of a civilization in history that didn't have slavery of some kind. One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day is that people seem to imagine that our societies in the West were the only ones who ever engaged in any vices. Alas, this isn't true. It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake, or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau, that everybody else in the world was born into sort of Edenic innocence and only we in the West had this sort of evil in us that caused us to do bad things to other people. Slavery was engaging by everyone in the ancient world, of course, and through most of the modern world as well. Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today, so it's clearly not something that the species as a whole has a problem with. That's more slaves, of course, than there were in the 19th century. And I'd say on top of that, the interesting thing about the Western mind as regards to slavery is that we were the civilization that did away with it. And by the way, the founding fathers of America who today are lambasted routinely for being acquiescent in the slave trade, engaging in it, owning slaves. People almost don't even bother now to recognize the facts that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, all wanted to see this trade done away with. Couldn't hold the country together at the origins if they'd have made such an effort and believed and hoped that it would be something that would be dealt with after their time. So the founding ideas had within them the notion that we should, as a people, get rid of this. The founding lines of the Declaration of Independence set up the conditions under which slavery will be impossible. All men are created equal. Once you've put that, that's a time bomb under the whole concept of slavery. That's ticking away. Okay. And sure enough, it detonated in the next century. If we just step back and look at the human species, what does slavery teach you about human nature? The fact that slavery has appeared as a function of society throughout human history. There are two possibilities. One is it's what people think they can do when God's not watching. Another is it's what they can do if they think that God allows it. Really, really well put. And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation, what does that mean? Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way. There are people who get to work for free. Because economic in nature in some sense. Yes. But in order to do it, I mean, almost always, there are some examples in the ancient world where this wasn't the case, but almost always it had to be a subjugated people or people regarded as different. One of the things actually I've tried to sort of inject into the discussion through this book among other things is a recognition that there were very major questions still going on in the 18th and early 19th century that were unresolved, which were one of the reasons why slavery was not as morally repugnant to people then as it is to us now. And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis. At the time of Thomas Jefferson, the founding fathers were thinking and working. They didn't know, because nobody knew whether the human races were related or not. There were arguments, the monogenesis argument that we were all indeed from the same racial stock. Polygenesis argument was that we weren't. Black Africans, Ethiopians, they're often referred to at the time because they provided some of the first slaves, were different from white Europeans, simply not related in any way. And that makes it easier, of course, that makes it easier to enslave people if you think they're not your brother. Am I my brother's keeper? No, he's not your brother. And it was a very troubling argument in the 18th and 19th century also because there was a biblical question. It threw up a theological question, which was, I mean, people were literally debating this at the time. Was there also a black Adam and Eve? Was there as it were an Indian Adam and Eve, the Native American Adam and Eve? This was a serious theological debate because they didn't know the answer. People say that Darwin solved this. It wasn't just Darwin, of course, but by the late 19th century, the argument that we were not all related, that human beings had suffered so many blows that you had to really be very, very ignorant, deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then. So it no longer was after Darwin, a theological question, it became a moral question. It was already a moral question, but it clarified, Darwin clarifies it definitely. And then you're in this, as I say, you're in a situation of you're not subjugating some other people, you're subjugating your own kin. And that becomes morally unsustainable. So given that slavery in America is part of its history, how do we incorporate into the calculus of policy today, social discourse, what we learn in school? We can look at slavery in America. We can look at maybe more recent things like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust. How do we incorporate that in terms of how we create policy, how we treat each other, all those kinds of things? What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities, the injustices of the past into the way we are today? That's a very complex question because it's a moral question at this point and a moral question long after the fact. I say at one point in the war in the West that the argument, for instance, on reparations now that goes on and is not a fringe argument anymore. Some people say, oh, you're pulling up this fringe argument. It really isn't. I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2020 was willing to talk about the possibility of reparations. I'm very eager that this country, America, goes through that entirely self-destructive exercise. I say that there's a lot of problems with this, but if I could refine it out of one thing, I'd say this. It's no longer about a wealth transfer from one group of people who did something wrong to another group of people who were wronged. It would have been that, could have been that 200 years ago. Today it's not even the descendants of people who did something wrong giving money to people who were the descendants of people who were wronged. It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past to another group of people who resemble people who were wronged. That's impossible to do. I'm completely clear about this. There is no way in which you could organize such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons. It's filled with people who have the same skin color as us, for instance, who have no connection to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money to people who have some connection. Then the country is also filled with ethnic minorities who have come after slavery, who would not be due for any reimbursement, as it were. The problem with this is, though, is that I'm perfectly open to the possibility that there are residual inequities that exist in American life and that the consequences of slavery could be one of the factors that resulted from this. The thing is, I don't think it's a single issue answer. I think it's a multidimensional issue, something like Black Underachievement in America. It's obviously a multidimensional issue. Much of the left and others wish to say it's not. It's only about racism. They can't answer why Asians who've arrived more recently don't, for instance, get held down by white supremacy. But actually, I say white supremacy in quotes, obviously. But don't get held back by it, but actually flourish to the extent that Asian Americans have higher household earnings and higher household mean equity than white Americans. So I don't think that on the merits, the evidence is there that racism is the explanation for Black ongoing Black underachievement in some segments of the Black community in America. It's obviously a part of it. Would you say that even those things like fatherlessness and similar family breakdown issues are a long-term consequence of it? Possibly, but it's being awfully generous to people's ability to make bad decisions. For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust would you allow people to claim that everything that went wrong in the Jewish community was as a result of the Holocaust? Is there some kind of term limit on this? I would have thought so. And I think most people probably think that's over. I think the details matter there. But it's very difficult. We're in deep waters here. Oh, I enjoy swimming out in the ocean. Although I'm terrified of what's lurking underneath in the darkness. You're right. You're right to be. Okay. It's really complicated calculus with the Holocaust and with slavery. So the argument in America is that there's deep institutional racism against African Americans that's rooted in slavery. And so however that calculus turns out, that calculation, it still persists in the culture, in the institutions, in the allocation of resources, in the way that we communicate in subtle ways, in major ways, all that kind of stuff. How is it possible to win or lose that argument of how much institutional racism there is that's rooted in slavery? Is it a winnable? It's an unquantifiable argument. And I'd like to apply some shortcuts to some of this. For instance, all, let's take the EV1 that's most often cited. If a white person is walking down a street in America and they see a group of young black men coming towards them and it's late at night and they cross the road, is it because of slavery? Is it because of institutional racism? No, it's because they've made a calculus based not entirely on unfounded beliefs that given crime rates, it's possible that this group of people might be a group of people they don't want to meet late at night. That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics in American cities are from American cities bear out, it's not an entirely unreasonable one. It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously. But is it attributable to slavery? It's a stretch. If you're in a city like Chicago where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years, albeit again, as always has to be remembered, mainly black on black gun violence and knife violence. Nevertheless, if you're in a city like Chicago, and you make that calculus, I've just suggested the cliched one, the street late at night, there are other factors other than a memory of slavery that kick in. And I'm afraid it's something which people don't want to particularly acknowledge in America for obvious reasons, because it's the ugliest damn debate in the world. But I was actually just writing in my column in the New York Post today about a very interesting case that's sort of similar, which is the question of obesity in the US. As you know, America is the most overweight country in the world. America has I think, 40% of the population is obese in medical ways and the nearest next country is a long way down. That's New Zealand, 30% of the population. So America is a long way ahead. Why during the coronavirus era when we know that obesity is the one clearest factor that's likely to lead to your hospitalization if you also get the virus? Why did almost no public health information in America focus on obesity? 80% of the people who ended up hospitalized in America with coronavirus were obese. We locked the schools when there was no evidence that the coronavirus was deadly for children. We all wore cloth masks when there was very little evidence that this was much use in stopping the spread of the virus. We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem and we never addressed it. Why? Is it just because we worried about fat people? No, it's actually because about fat shaming as it were. No, it's also because to a great extent it's a racial issue in America as well. And actually I quoted this new publication from the University of Chicago as it happens, which makes that claim explicit. It says, the reasons why people have views that are negative about obesity is because of racism and slavery. This is what everything is drawn back to in America. Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of racism, it's because of slavery. How about it's actually because you mind the hospitals getting clogged up, you mind people dying, you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying and you'd like to say something about it. Once again, as is in everything in America, it's cut off by some poorly educated academic saying it's about slavery. This requires a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society, probably one that's not possible without killing the patient. And it's being done by people who are wearing mittens. So I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this that are rolling their eyes and saying, here we go again, two white guys talking about the lack of institutional racism in America. First of all, what would you like to tell them? So our African American friends who are looking at this, and I've gotten a chance to talk to a bunch of them on Clubhouse recently. Clubhouse is the social app. And I really enjoy it. It's an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see it. I personally love it because you get to talk to, as somebody who's an introvert and doesn't socialize much, I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life. So it gave me a chance to first of all practice Russian and Ukrainian. So I get the chance to do that. Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine with people who are from that part of the world. And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground where they start screaming, they start crying, they start being calm and collected and thoughtful. As if you walked into a bar with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks, just people that have quote unquote lived experiences, real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases, and you get to listen to them go at it with no, because it's an audio app, you're not allowed to start getting into a physical fist fight. So even though it really sounds like people want it. Sounds like it's happening. Yeah. And so you get to really listen to that feeling. And for example, it allows a white guy like me from another part of the world coming from the former Soviet Union to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans screaming about Joe Rogan using the N word. And I get to really listen. There's very different perspectives on that in the African American community. And it's fascinating to listen. So I don't get access to that by sort of excellent books and articles written and so on. You get that real raw emotion. And I'm just saying there's a few of those folks listening to this with that real raw emotion and they, one argument they say is you, Douglas Murray and you Lex Freeman don't have the right to talk about race and racism in America. It is our struggle. You are from a privileged class of people that don't know what it's like to be a black man or woman in America walking down the street. Can you steel man that case? First of all, fuck that. I think we need to define steel manning. I know what steel manning is. I really resent that form of argumentation. Sure. I really resent it. I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want and no one's going to stop me or try to intimidate me or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color. And I think that if I said to somebody else the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible. If I said, shut up, you have no right to criticize anything that Douglas Murray says because you've not got my skin color. Okay. It's not an exact comparison, but seriously, is that a reasonable form of argument? You haven't been through everything I've been through in my life. Or you can't comment. No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything. We might as well pack up, go home and isolate ourselves. Strong words, but can you try to steel man the case? Not in this particular situation, but there's people that have lived through something that can comment in a very specific way. For example, Holocaust survivors. There is a sense in which maybe a basic sense of civility when a Holocaust survivor is speaking about their experience of the Holocaust, then an intellectual from a very different part of the world that's simply writing about nuanced geopolitics of World War II just should not interrupt the Holocaust survivor. We physically interrupt them if they're telling their story. Good logic and reason that the experience of the Holocaust survivor somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding of the humanity and the injustice of the- First of all, again, we're in even deeper waters now, but in terms of wanting to listen to another person who has experienced something, yes. Yes. But not endlessly. Not endlessly. I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust who didn't experience the Holocaust and have written about it better than people who did. This idea that the lived experience, to use this terrible modern jargon as if there's another type, this idea that the lived experience has to triumph over everything else is not always correct. It can be correct in some circumstances. If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor and somebody who'd never heard about the Holocaust and wanted to shoot out their views on it, yeah, one of those people should be heard more than the other, obviously. If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand and there's somebody else who has never experienced it, then obviously you'd want to hear from the person who has experienced it firsthand if that is the discussion underway. I don't think that it's the case that that is endlessly the case. I'm also highly reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who by dint of their skin color or anything else get to dominate the microphone. Now, of course, we're literally both speaking into microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this, but let's skate over the irony. What I mean is people saying, you don't have the right to speak. I have the right to take the microphone from you and speak because I know best. Fine. If you know best, we'll argue it out and someone will win long or short term. But the almost aggressive tone in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of. Nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. Nobody's. And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collectively is to fall for that thing. I think it was Camille Farser who said it first, but I've adopted in recent years, is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally, my lived experience, everything about me. You should dedicate your life to trying to do that. Simultaneously, you'll never understand me. This is not an attractive invitation. This is an unwinnable game. So if somebody has a legitimate and important point to make, they should make it and they will win through whatever their characteristics, whatever their race. And by the way, there are plenty of white people who experience racism as well. There are plenty of white people who do and have done and increasingly so, which is one of the things I write about from the war on the West. I mean, I would argue that today in America, the only group who are actually allowed to be consistently, vilely racist against the white people. If you say disgusting things about black people in America in 2022, you will be over. You will be over. If you decide to talk about people's white tears, their white female tears, their white guilt, their white privilege, their white rage, and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms, you'll be just fine. You can be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You can lecture at Yale University, absolutely fine. And the white people have to suck that up as if that's fine because there was racism in another direction in the past. So white people can have racism as well. Does that mean that I think that I have a right or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse by talking about their feelings of having been the victims of racism? No, not particularly, because what does that get us? It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimhood. Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence have experienced historically anything like the violence that was perpetrated against black people in America historically? Obviously not. But, you know, what kind of competition do we want to enter here? And this is very, very important terrain now in America, because there's one other thing I have to throw in there, which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim? How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made? At one point in this latest book, I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche and the genealogy of morals, where, as you know, Nietzsche always has to be treated carefully. You know, when people say, I love Nietzsche, you have to say, which bits? What exactly do you love about him? But a lot can be learned from the answer. But there are moments in genealogy of morals that were very useful for this book. One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase that I've now stolen for myself, appropriated, you might say, where he refers to people who tear at wounds long since closed and then cry about the pain they feel. Now, how do you know? How do you know whether the pain is real? How do you know? I'm not saying you can never know. But it's hard. So when somebody says, I feel that my life hasn't gone that well, and it's because of something that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago, maybe they do feel that. Maybe they're right to feel that. Maybe they're making it up. Maybe they're using it as a reason for failure in life. Maybe they're using it as a reason to not even try. Maybe they're using it as a reason to smoke weed all day. I don't know. And who does know? How can you work that out? And that's why I come back to this thing of who are we to constantly judge in this society other people who we don't know and attribute motives to them based on racial or other characteristics And as you write in this part, I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche and at the same time canceling Nietzsche in the same set of sentences. But you write in this part about evil. I didn't cancel Nietzsche. I can't cancel Nietzsche. I was saying treat him carefully. Treat him carefully. Fair enough. But you can judge a man's character by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes. Fair enough. I think when you meet people who do man and Superman a bit too much. Now you're pulling in even deeper water referencing Hitler here. Okay. So you write in this part of the book about evil. Quote, what is it that drives evil? Many things without doubt, but one of them is identified by several of the great philosophers is resentment. That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers for people who want to destroy. Colon blaming someone else for having something you believe you deserve more. And you're saying this kind of resentment, we don't know as it surfaces whether it's genuine or if it's used to sort of play games of power to evil ends. Can you speak to this? Because it's such an fascinating idea that one of the biggest drivers of evil in the world is resentment. Because if you look at, boy, if you look at human history, if you look at Hitler, so much of the propaganda, so much of the narrative was about resentment. So that surface level or is that deep? The resentment that drives evil? It can be any of the above. Let's first of all preface it. Everybody has resentment. I use the term resentment, which is thought very similar to resentment. Let's stick with resentment. So we don't sound too pretentious. The let me give you a quick example of somebody in our own day who has a form of resentment, Vladimir Putin. Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace? Yes. You remember the stuff about Putin as a young KGB officer in Germany? And the stuff about Putin, his first wife's resentment of one of his KGB colleagues who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger than the Putin's apartment. Yeah. It's very interesting. And by the way, I'm not saying that, you know, Vladimir Putin became the man he has become and invaded Ukraine because he didn't have an apartment he liked in Berlin or Munich wherever he was. It's a distinct possibility. My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives and we all feel it in our lives and it's something that has to be struggled against. Resentment is in political terms can be a deadly, I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing to draw upon. I mean, you mentioned Hitler. Obviously, one of the things that Hitler played on was resentment, obviously. Almost every revolution does. I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well. Not without cause. It was a good reason to feel that Versailles was not listening to Paris in the 1780s and to feel resentment for Marie Antoinette in her palace within the palace, ignoring the bread shortages in Paris. So resentment is a very understandable thing and sometimes it's justifiable and it's also deadly to the person as it is to the society. It's an incredibly deep sentiment. Somebody else has got something that you should have. And the problem about it is that it has the potential to be endless. You can do it your whole life. And one of the ways I've sort of found myself explaining this to people is to say it's also important to recognize that resentment is something that can cross absolutely every boundary. So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries, obviously, it goes without saying. More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries and socioeconomic boundaries. And if I was to sort of simplify this thought, I would say, I guess that you and I and everybody watching knows or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a happy person, even a cheerful person. And I think we probably have also, or many of us would have met people who seem to have everything and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment. Somebody else has held them back from something, their sister once did something, she got this and I should have got that and on and on and on. It's a human trait. And one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this. This is something which we can do something about, not limitlessly. But for instance, I mean, there are very good reasons that some people in their lives might feel resentment. Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel and that's why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair. That's a pertinent example of this in American politics at the moment. You would be justified in feeling resentment. And at some point you have to make a decision, which is, am I going to be that person or a different person? But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level and the societal level is destructive to the mind. Even when you're quote unquote justified. It rots you. It rots you because the best you can do is to eke out your days unfulfilled. So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude. Yes. Gratitude is the antidote to evil in a sense. Gratitude is the individual level and the societal level. Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment. I quote in The War on the West, when I read it the first time a few years ago, I was absolutely floored by the Brothers Karamazov. Not everything in it, by the way, but I have some very big structural criticisms of the novel. Now you're just sweet talking to me because I'm a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this. Oh, okay. Well, we could get into what I see as big structural flaws in the Brothers Karamazov. Anyway, now I'm offended and triggered. Yeah, no, I mean, this is coming out of Macbeth and saying, I didn't think it was much good. Yeah, there's structural flaws. Yeah, I thought the ending stank. Yeah. The middle wasn't very good. When I read that novel, I was floored by a couple of things. One is, of course, at the moment where we realize the devil appears. The moment that Ivan says to his brother, you know he visits me, and he realized that he's talking about the devil, the whole novel goes into this totally different space. Anyway, it's even more than you've already realized the novel's about. And then when the conversation occurs between Ivan and the devil, I think he describes him as dressed in the French style of the early part of the 19th century. It's strange that the devil would be dressed like that. And if you remember, he's sort of cross-legged and rather a Bane figure. The devil mentions in passing to Ivan that he says, I don't know why gratitude is not an instinct that's been given to me. Yeah, you're not allowed. This is not, given the role of being the devil, this is not one of the things. It's just not one of the things. And of course, only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could, I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel out of that insight. Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away because there's such an abundance of riches that he still has to get through, structural problems aside. The passive aggressive, the microaggression in this conversation is palpable. Little knife fight. But the reason I mention this is because, of course, when I saw this, this is such a brilliant insight by Dostoevsky because why would gratitude not be a sentiment that the devil was capable of? The answer is, of course, that if the devil was capable of gratitude, he wouldn't be the devil. He'd be somebody else. He has to be incapable of gratitude. Do you think for Dostoevsky that was as strong of an insight as it is for you? Because I think that's a really powerful idea that with gratitude, you don't get the resentment that rots you from the core. Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things that he saw in us. And the way I put it is that, I mean, I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction, which is one of the things I'd like us to call the era that's now ending. The era of deconstruction was the era that started, let's say, from the 60s onwards and was originally an academic game that then spilled out into the wider culture, which was, let's take everything apart. Let's pull it all apart. There are lots of problems with it. One is it's quite boring. You don't get an awful lot from it. You also have the problem of what children find when they try to do this with bicycles, which is they can take it apart quite easily, but they can't put it back together. And the era of taking things apart as a game is one we've lived through and it's been highly destructive. But you can do it for quite a long time. I'm going to look at this society and I'm going to take it apart by showing systemic problems. At the end of that, what have you got? What have you done? What have you achieved? We need to interrogate this. Okay, interrogate. By all means, ask questions, but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this. I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart. And again, at the end of it, what have you got? Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music or an idea or a society, fine. Just question, endlessly question. Yes, interrogate. Assumes it's all criminal in a cell and it's guilty and therefore it must be taken apart. And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West. And that's resentment. That's one byproduct of resentment. You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart. Is a little bit of resentment good? So you have, you know that I love Tom Waits and he has a song where a little drop of, I like my time with a little drop of poison. Is it good to do that? Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink? It depends what the poison is and it depends if you know not to have another drink. It might be the case you find out as some alcoholics too that one was too many and 10 is not enough. So there's a natural, in this case, this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope. It becomes an addiction, becomes a drug and you just can't stop. You'd have to wean yourself off it and try to start creating again. You'd have to start trying to put things together again. Something I think might be in the throes of starting as it happens. Well speaking of taking things apart and not putting them together again, the idea of critical race theory. Can you to me explain, so I'm an engineer and have not been actually paying attention much unfortunately to these things. None of the people in your field were until it comes along and smacks you in the face. I've had that line of thinking from MIT. I said well surely whatever you folks are busy about yelling at each other for is a thing at Harvard and Yale. It's not going to be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. People in the STEM subjects thought it's not coming for us. It can't come to us and bang. Well it hasn't quite been a bang. Engineering is more safe than others. So let's draw a line now between engineering and science. I think engineering is I'm sitting in a castle in the tallest tower with my pinky out drinking my martini saying surely the peasants below with their biology and their humanities will figure it all out. No, I'm just kidding. There's no pinky out. I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants. Okay, where is this metaphor has gone too far? Can you explain to this engineer what critical race theory is? Is it a term that's definable? Is there a tradition? Is there a history? What is good about it? What is bad about it? It is a tradition. It is a history. It's a school of thought. It started in the law roughly in the 1970s in some of the American Academy. It spilled out. It always aimed to be an activist philosophy. People deny that now, but as I cite in the war on the west, the foundational texts say as much. This is an activist academic study. We're not just looking at the law. We seek to change the law. And it's built out into all of the other disciplines. I think there's a reason for that, by the way, which is it happened at the time that the humanities and others in America were increasingly weak and didn't know what to do and they needed more games to play or new games to play. The psychologists got bored. Yeah. I mean, well, they needed tenure and they needed something to do. And I mean, it's not an original observation. Plenty of people have made this, but I mean, Neil Ferguson said this some time ago, for instance, that in the last 50 years in American academia, certainly in humanities departments, when somebody dies out who's a great scholar in something, that's just not replaced by somebody of equal stature. They were placed by somebody who does theory or critical race theory. They were placed by somebody who does the modern games. Somebody dies out who's a great historian of say, I don't know, it's the ones on my mind, Russian history or Russian literature, and they're not replaced by a similar scholar. In his observation and in yours, is this a recent development? It's happened in the last few decades for sure, and it's sped up. Is it because we've gotten to the bottom of some of the biggest questions of history? No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions. Because it's more fun to, big questions aren't as fun? No, partly it's, no, I should stress it, partly this is in the weeks, but partly it's a result of the hyper specialization in academia. You know, if you said you'd like to write your dissertation on Hobbes, if you wanted to, if you, something central to Kant's thought or Hegel or something, I mean, that's not popular. What's popular is to take somebody way down the line from that because there's a feeling that that's all been done. So you take something way, way, way down the line from that, that's much less important, and then you sort of play with that. And I think most people, anyone who's watching who's been in a philosophy department or anything else in recent years will know that tendency. By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this. I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life when he would occasionally, he didn't get tenure at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in even by his enemies to teach courses in various universities in basics of philosophy because there was no one in the department able to do it. Like he would, he would, he would go in and teach for a semester, you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others, because there was no one to do it because they were all playing with the things way, way, way down the road from this. So that had already happened and people were searching for new games to play and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in, partly in the way that all of this that's now known as anti-racism does, which is in a sort of bullying tone of saying, if you don't follow this, it's the same way that all the things that are called studies, I think everything called studies in the humanities should be shut down. Because of the activist element. It's an, they're all activists, gay studies and queer studies. Nothing good has ever come from it. Nothing good. To push back, is it, is it obvious that activism is a sign of a flaw in a discipline? So isn't it- It's a sign of the death of the discipline. It's a sign that discipline is over. But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline to enact change, positive change in the world? Or is that to, is that, that's for politicians to do with the findings of science, not- Why create an ideology and then set out to find disciplines that are weakly put together to try to back up your political ideology? So ideology should not be part of, of, of science or of- No, I mean, why would you, I mean, anyone could do it. You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing about something and only do things that prove your right wing ideas, be fantastically anti-academic, fantastically anti-science. It's an absurd way to mix up activism and, and, and, and academia. And it's absolutely right. And Critical Race Theory is one of the ones that completely polluted the academy. Yeah. And there's been dark moments throughout history, both for, during World War II with both communism and Naziism, fascism, that infiltrated science and then corrupted it. Yes. I mean, for instance, also let's face it, in science, as in everything else, there are dark, difficult things. It's much better we know about them, face up to them and try to find a way socially to deal with them than that you leave them in the hands of some activist who wants to do stuff with them. Some of my best friends are activists, I'm just kidding. Okay. None of my best friends are activists. That's how it should be. Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends, but okay. Now I'm trying to gain some pity points. Okay. So to return- You have your clubhouse friends screaming away like deranged maniacs. Now I'm anti-clubhouse by the way, because the only time I heard it was that Brett Weinstein one when he did that. I don't know if you heard that early in clubhouse. I was invited to clubhouse by various people who said, oh, this is a really great, civilized way to hang out and talk with interesting people. I downloaded the app and I got on one night and because Brett Weinstein said, I'm doing this conversation and I listened and it was the maddest damn discussion I've ever heard. Was it something about biology? Something about, was it COVID times? At some point Brett said, I'm an evolutionary biologist and somebody else started saying, you're a eugenicist. And he said, no, I'm an evolutionary biologist. That's the same thing. And it just went on like that. And Brett desperately tried to explain that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist and he lost the clubhouse room. They thought that was the same thing. It horribly reminded me of a time some years ago in a British newspaper, realizing that the only thing you can unite people on in sexual ethics is revulsion against pedophilia. Ran an anti-pedo campaign and shortly after pediatrician's offices were torched in North of England by a mob who hadn't read the whole sign. Yeah. Well, to me, like I said, a little bit of poison is good for the town. So, anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you with flattering you with our people on clubhouse. I have many, I have multiples of friends. Yes. We didn't get to some of the ideas of critical race theory. What exactly is it? I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely. Yeah. It's an attempt to look at everything among other things through the lens of race and to add race into things where it may not be as a way of adding, I'm trying to give the most generous estimation, to add race in as a conversation in a place where it may not have been in the conversation. That means history too? The history of racism? Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All history. And to look at it through these particular lenses. I mean, there's a certain, like all these things, there's a certain logic in it. Like with feminist studies or something, I mean, is there a utility in looking back through undoubtedly male dominated histories and asking where the more silent female voice was? Yes. Very interesting. Not endlessly interesting and can't be put exactly on the same par as, but it has a utility. It's that endlessly sorry to interrupt that endlessly part that seems to get us into trouble a lot. Well, because of this thing of where do you stop? And that's, that's, that's always a, I looked at, talked about this in my last book in the manners of crowds. It's one of the big conundrums in activist movements and particularly in activist academia. Where would you stop? It's not clear because you've got a job in it. You've got a pension in it. You've got your only esteem in society is in keeping this gig going. What I mean is, is there any likelihood? Have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't it? That, you know, the end of every conference, the only thing everyone agrees on is that we must have another conference like this one. So one thing they always agree on. This conference is so great. We must have another one. Well, that's a criticism you could apply to a lot of disciplines. Of course civil engineering bridge building. It's at a certain point. Do we need any more bridges? Can we just fly everywhere? So at the very least you need to keep the bridges up. Sure. And they would, a critical race theory folks would probably make the same argument that the very least we need to keep the racism out. We have to make sure we don't descend into the racism. It assumes all the time that we are living on the cusp of the return of the KKK. Right. Which is totally wrong. I mean, it's a massive. You say that now until the KKK armies march in. We don't always, we can't always predict the future. We can't always predict the future and you can always say you should be careful, but you've also got to be careful of people who've got their timing like totally, totally wrong or their estimation of the society they're in. You mean like most of society before in the 1930s when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong. Sure they did. And so, most people. So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there. Well, beware of the man with the mustache. Yes. If only it was that easy. Um, it's not always about facial hair. I always say that. I mean, what, what? Well, it very often is these two clean shaven chaps say one of the problems with everybody knowing a little bit about Nazism is that they think that they know where evil comes from and that it comes from like a German with a small mustache, getting people to goose step for instance. And that's not correct. A much better understanding of it is it can come from all number of directions and keep your antennae as good as you can. But once you end up in this society, which I would argue certainly parts of America in where you're always in 1938, that's not healthy for a society either. Where, where people are so primed and think they're so well trained because they spent a term in school learning about the second world war and the Holocaust think they're so well trained in Hitler spotting that they can do it all the time. Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies like dog whistle. You know, as I always say, if you hear the whistle, you're the dog. But people say that's a dog whistle as if they're highly trained anti-Nazis. I mean, you know, there should be some humility in it. We should, we should be careful. We should be wary for sure. And we should also be slightly humble in our inability to, to spot everything. If not significantly humble. Right. So if we can, there's something funny, if not dark about the, the activity of Hitler spotting, if I just may take an aside, but so critical race theory, how much racism, what is racism? How much of it is in our world today? If we were thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting, how, and trying to steel man the case of if not critical race theory, but people who, who look for racism in our world, how much would you say? Well it's a good thing to try to define. I would say that racism is the, the belief that other people are inferior to you. You could say you could see a form of it where you thought people were superior to you. That could also happen, but more commonly is you see a group of people as being inferior to you simply by dint of the fact that they have a different racial background. And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism. As I say, I mean, there are types of racism, mainly antisemitism actually, perhaps it's the only one which weirdly relies on, on a hatred of people who a certain type of person thinks thinks are better than them. And that's a particular peculiarity, one of the peculiarities of antisemitism. Well, antisemitism somehow does both, right? Yes. Well, one of the eternal fascinating things about antisemitism is it can do, it does everything at the same time. It's like a quantum racism. Yes. Both superior and inferior. Do you know Vasily Grosvenor's Life and Fate? So in the middle of Life and Fate, which a Persian friend of mine who said was one of only two great novels of the 20th century, she was very harsh, literally critic. What was the other one? Oh, The Leopard, obviously. The Leopard? The Leopard of Giuseppe de Lampedusa. Yeah. Okay. She's definitely right on that one. Life and Fate is- I'm learning so much today. Yes, Life and Fate. Life and Fate is an extraordinary book, mainly about- well, you know Grosvenor was a, obviously Jewish himself, but he saw almost everything that he could have done in the Second World War. He saw Stalingrad, a journalist, and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad. He was also the first journalist into Treblinka. And his account, which you can read in one of the collections of his journalism, his account of walking into Treblinka is just one of the most devastating, haunting pieces of journalism or prose you can read. Anyhow, I mentioned him because Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate, which is about a 900 page novel, in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis around Stalingrad, the way at one point he amazingly sort of goes into the minds of both Hitler and Stalin. He says Stalin in his study feels his counterpart in Berlin, and he says he feels very close to him at this moment. Wow. Around Stalingrad, like leading up to the battle. After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost, he says he feels the closeness of Hitler. But Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate, slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century, suddenly dedicates a chapter to antisemitism. And I've seen antisemitism is something I've always been very interested in, because I've always had an instinctive utter revulsion of it. And also partly because of having seen bits of it in the Middle East and elsewhere. But I mentioned this because Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate, takes time out and does this three page description of antisemitism. And it's extraordinary. The only thing I can think of that's equally good is Gregor von Retsori, who wrote a luridly titled but brilliant set of novellas called Confessions of an Antisemite about pre-First World War antisemitism in Eastern and Central Europe. Grosvenor says, in the middle of Life and Fate, that one of the extraordinary things about antisemitism is that it does everything at the same time. Those Jews get condemned in one place for being rich and in another for being poor, condemned in one place for assimilating in another for not assimilating, for assimilating too much and assimilating too little, for being too successful for not being successful enough. I think it's the only racism that includes within it a detestation for the real antisemite, a detestation of people that the person may perceive to be better than them, correctly or otherwise. By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read this one of two greatest novels of the 20th century, Life and Fate, and just to read off of Wikipedia, I see Grosvenor, the Ukrainian Jew became a correspondent for the Soviet military paper, Krasnaya Zvezda, having volunteered and been rejected for military service. He spent a thousand days in the front lines, roughly three of the four years of the conflict between the Germans and Soviets. And the main themes covered in, how does it go, Life and Fate, I keep thinking, is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust, Grossman's idea of humanity and the human goodness, Stalin's distortion of reality and values, and science, like goes on in reality of war. It's interesting. I need to definitely read it. I think you'll really get a lot from it. One of the other things, sorry, I'm rippling it, but one of the other things he does is that he has this extraordinary ability to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict and then zoom in. It's rather like the camera work they use in things like Lord of the Rings, where he zooms down and then gets one person in the midst of all this and you get on that. Or puts you in the study too. So I personally have read and reread the William Shire's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, who was another journalist who was there, but he does not do it. Interestingly enough, given such a large novel, kind of the definitive work on, the definitive original work that goes to Source Materials on Hitler, he doesn't touch antisemitism really. Big thing to miss out. Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively as he does for most of the work that this was the fact of life. There's a lot of cruelty throughout, but he doesn't get to- Well, one of the things is of course he lost the war because of antisemitism. I mean, that's one kind of important way to view it. Andrew Roberts, another historian, said is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war because they were Nazis. It sounds almost too neat, but it's worth remembering that at the end of the war, when the Germans need to be transporting troops and they need to be transporting very basic supplies, Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains to transport the Jews right up to the end. Well, that's certainly a dark possibility. You know, anyhow, but to go back to racism in general, racism in general, apart from antisemitism, relies on the perception that another group of people, a racial group, other than your own are inferior to you. That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism. And of course, it's one of the stupidest things that our species is capable of. I mean, one of the stupidest that you can look at a person and guess them in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color. I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is, as well as being an evil one. But the, the, I would say that one of the, I think it's a dangerous thing in our era that there are bits of it coming back. That's why I say we do need sort of, we need our antennae working. We just don't need them to be overactive or underactive, you know. Now, the book is war in the West, but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups based on their skin color, you've said that there's a war on white people in the West. Would you say that's the case? Would you say that there is significant racism towards white people in the United States? I'd say that the white people in the United States are the only people who are told that they have hereditary sin. And that's a big one, just to start with. Based strictly on the color of the skin. Based on their skin color. I mean, I would find it so repugnant if, and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this, I would feel it so repugnant if there were any school of thought in America today that had any grasp on the public attention that said that black people were born into evil because of something their ancestors had done. Like they had the mark of Cain upon them. I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way to try to demoralize a group of people and to tell them that the things they would be able to achieve in their lives are much lessened because they should spend significant portions of their lives trying to atone for something they didn't do. Is there a difference? And the point, the obvious point left unsaid, but let's say it, nobody in the public square says that, and they're the maniacs of the far fringes, but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that, or I think even think that about any group of people other than white people. And does this mean that white people are more disadvantaged than black people? No. And again, let's not make this a competition, but let's not get into, I just desperately urge people not to get into the idea of hereditary sin according to racial background. Is there something to be said about the feature aspect to sort of play devil's advocate about the asymmetry of sort of accusations towards the majority? So because white, it's much easier to attack a majority. It is much easier, but is there something to be said about that being a useful function of society that you always attack? That the minority has disproportionate power to attack the majority so that you can always keep the majority in check? Well, it's a dangerous game to play, isn't it? I think that's a good summary of entirety of human civilization. Well, yeah, everything is dangerous. But it's a very dangerous game to play that. I wrote about this a bit in the matters of crowds when I was saying to like gay rights people, the ones that still exist, the ones who don't have homes to go to, who want to beat up on straight people in a way, or want to make straight people feel like they're kind of unremarkable, uncool, you know, boring straights. So boring. So not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays. That's a bad idea to push that one. That's a bad idea. And some gays push that. Highly unwise, given the fact that about two to three percent of the population are actually gay, although now there's like an additional 20 percent who think they're like two spirit or something and all that bullshit, but they're just attention seekers. So let's not spend too much time on that. But equally, as I said, I said, the matters of crowds with the feminist movement, very unwise for half of the species to say that the other half of the species isn't needed. And there were always third and fourth wave feminists willing to make that nuts argument. Not first wave feminists. You didn't hear it in first wave feminists. You didn't hear it. Suffragettes tended not to say, we'd like the vote and men are scum. It would have been hard to have won everyone over to their side, not least the men they needed to win over to their side. But you do get third and fourth wave feminists who say like, you know, do we need men or men are all X? Again, it's a bad idea. It's a bad idea tactically. What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard, describes that men are the originators of violence, physical violence in society. And he argues that actually the world would be better off. No, just a very cold calculus. If you get rid of men, there would be a lot less violence in society is his claim. But who says you need to get rid of violence in society? Well that's, but shouldn't that at least be a discussion? Have a debate on a panel discussion, violence, pros and cons. Well that's the sort of thing, if I can say so, the Sunday WeekHouse academic decides to do because he thinks that his area of Boston would be nicer or whatever. He might decide it's useful if he was living in Kiev today to have violent men. I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now, I'd need some violent men around here. But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men, is the argument. At least there's some level of threat that you ought to exude that puts people off. If I was in, I'm very glad that the men and women of Ukraine are capable of, and more than capable of fighting for their country and for their neighbors and their families and much more. But it's better that there was violence ready to unleash when violence was unleashed upon them than that the whole society had been told that they should identify as non-binary. But at least it's a conversation to have, isn't there aspect to the feminist movement that is correct in challenging the... Some forms of violence, domestic violence for instance, although women are capable of that as well. I'm learning about this. We're all learning about this at the moment. I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down in this beautiful mess that is human relations. But just to finish that thought, it's very unwise for women to war against men, as it would be for men to war against women. It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population. And in America, Britain, and other Western countries, white people are still a majority. And so why would you tell the majority that they're evil by dint of their skin color and think that that would be a good way to keep them in check? I'm not guilty of anything because of my skin color. I'm not guilty of anything. My ancestors didn't do anything wrong. And even if they had, why would I be held responsible for it? So to go back to Nietzsche, is there some aspect to where, if we try to explain the forces of play here, is it the will to power playing itself out from individual human nature and from group behavior nature? Is there some elements to this, which is the game we play as human beings is always when we have less power, we try to find ways to gain more power. That's certainly one. The desire to grab is, let me see if I can find a quote for you on that. The desire to grab that which we think we're owed and to do it often in the guise of justice. I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age and one of the very great bogus terms of our age. People forever talk about their search for justice. It's amazing how violent they can often be in their search for justice and how many rules they're willing to break so long as they can say they're after justice and how many norms they can trample so long as they can say it's in the name of justice. You can burn down buildings in the name of justice. Well, the majority groups throughout history, including those with white skin color, have done the same in the name of justice. We come up with all kinds of sexy terms in our propaganda machines to sell whatever atrocities we'd like to commit. One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked, and I quoted in this- Careful, I'm judging you harshly. Yeah, of course. Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment is they'll achieve their ultimate form of revenge, which is to turn happy people into unhappy people like themselves, to shove their misery in the faces of the happy so that in due course the happy, and this is quoting Nietzsche, start to be ashamed of their happiness and perhaps say to one another, it's a disgrace to be happy. There is too much misery. This is something to be averted for the sick says Nietzsche must not make the healthy sick too or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick. Well, I think there again, there's a lot of that going on. How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world? Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy? I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well. Sure. Notes from Underground. Okay. This has been very Russian, Russian focused. I'm very pleased with the number of times that Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in. This is very- I wasn't doing this as a sort of- Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats and good to know they're still relevant. Do you speak Russian by the way at all? Which I did. I'm told it's a 10 year language basically to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it. Well, there's the language and then there's the personality behind the language and the personality I feel like you already have. So you just need to know the surface details. Okay. In fact, the silence to be silent in the Russian language is something that's already important. Oh, if we had a moment, I'd tell you my story about Stalin's birthplace. Should I tell you that? No. I once went to Gori where Stalin was born. Have you been? No. I was there just after the Georgia war. I went to the no man's land in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And I said, I really got to go to Gori also here because the shell had landed in Gori rather weirdly from the Russian side and Gori is where Stalin was born. And of course Gori is in Georgia. And anyhow, the Museum of Stalin's birthplace, they've been trying to change for some years because it had been unadulteratedly pro-Stalin for years. And the Georgian authorities, this is in the Shakishvili's time, were trying to make it into a Museum of Stalinism. And it was really tough. The only place I've seen which is similar is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed. That also is like, they're not quite sure what to do. They don't want to say he's a bad guy because they think that people won't come. Anyhow, Stalin's house in Gori had changed from the Museum of Stalin to the Museum of Stalinism. There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil who had clearly been doing the tour for like 50 years. And it just pointed all the facts. She did that classic thing I've also saw it once in North Korea where they sort of, that sort of communist thing where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high by 13 feet deep. It gives you lots of facts. I don't care. Why does it matter? It will give you facts. This is Stalin's suitcase. It is 13 inches wide by, you know, there isn't. Anyhow, and this woman did all of this and it was all just wildly pro, well, not pro-Stalin, just explaining the Stalin's life. It was just a great local boy done good. They didn't mention the fact he killed more Georgians per capita than anyone else. Local boy done good. And we get to the end and before being taken to the gift shop where they sell red wine with Stalin's face on it and among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it, they took you to a little room under the stairs and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time. Now gift shop. And she says, no, no, cause I took the woman aside at the end. I just go, what she'd said is to other journalists and I took her aside and I said, what do you think about communist Stalin? And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this during communist times. He said it's not my place to judge, you know, sort of thing. We have an interesting comment in itself. I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone and all that sort of thing. It's not my place to judge or to give my views and those sort of things. And eventually I said, well, what do you feel about it? And she said, it was like a hurricane. It happened. It's interesting because if I may mention clubhouse once again, I got an chance to talk to a few people from Mongolia. There's a woman from Mongolia and they talked about the fact that they deeply admire Stalin love. She sounded, if I may, hopefully that's not crossing line. I think I'm representing her correctly in saying she admired him almost like, um, like loved them like the people, the way people love like, um, like, like Jesus, like a holy figure. Well, isn't that still the case in large parts of Russia? Yeah. I mean, keep some Stalin keeps on winning greatest Russian of all time. And that's perhaps maybe there's a dip, but if we were to think about the long arc of history, perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up as there's something about human memory that it just, you forget the details of the atrocities of the past. I mean, think of the number of people we talk about as historical heroes, Napoleon. I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero, but the French, now you're, you did the thing that the Stasovsky now again, tricky ground, but like the, the, the French are enormous in my Napoleon and they had many animal assets. He was also unbelievable brute and killed many people unnecessarily. And there are lots of figures from history that we sort of cover that over with. Yeah. Yeah. Can we mention Churchill briefly? Because he is one of the, um, you can make a case for him being one of the great representatives or great figures historically of the Western civilization. And then there's a lot of people, uh, from not a lot. I know I have like three friends and one of them happens to be from London and they say that he's a, a, um, not a good person. Why? So listen, this friend would not discuss, I just, this is an opinion poll of the three friends, but I do know that there's quite a bit, you know, there's a back cash going on at the moment at the moment. And in general, there's a spirit like reflecting on, on the darker sides of some of these historical figures like challenging history through it's, it's not just critical race theory. It's, it's, it's challenging history through, well, uh, are the people we think of as heroes, what are their flaws and are they villains that are convenient? Um, sort of, uh, were there at the right time to accidentally do the right thing. Exactly. Well, I hope this isn't the representative fair estimation of your friend in London's views. No, she's going to be quite mad at this, but I didn't say the name, so it could be any friends. It could be Canada. Well, see, I, uh, I, given that away, but that's with, of course I would not, um, I made that up completely. It's, it's all just like my girlfriend in Canada. She's completely a figment of my imagination. Still us Winston Churchill, uh, is somebody, I mean, just looking at reading the rise and fall of the third rike is an incredible figure that, um, that to me, so much of world war two is marked leading up to the war is marked by stunning amounts of cowardice by political leaders and it's fascinating to watch here. This person clearly with the drinking and a smoking problem was, I don't understand why that's a negative. No, I didn't say you see it. You throw it in as if it is. No, well, it's, it's called humor. I'll explain it to you one day what that means, but he stood up, he, he stood up to what we now see as evil when at the time it was not so obvious to see, um, you know, so that's, that's just a fascinating figure of Western civilization. I'd love to get your comments. The real criticisms, I mean, I was making a drinking, the real criticisms of, of, of Churchill are quite easy to sum up. And I do so in the war in the West. I say these are the things that they now use against him. Uh, didn't do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943. And since that's, that's been shot down by numerous historians, including Indian historians, uh, in the middle of the war, in the middle of a world war, Churchill did what he could to get grain supplies diverted, um, from Australia to, to, to, to Bengal. Uh, um, the famine was appalling. It was caused by a typhoon. It was not caused by Winston Churchill. Um, and the idea that some basically Indian nationalist historians have pumped out in recent years and just anti-Churchill figures that he actually wanted Indians to die is, um, it's just total calumny. And when people claim, some people claim that, I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars and nevertheless with some credentials who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population to basically be genocided. And it's complete nonsense, not least by the fact that during the period, which in question Indian population boomed. Um, so that's one of the main ones. Another one is that he had, um, some views that we now had regarded as racist. He definitely regarded races as being of different characters, um, and that there were superior races and the, the, as it were, the white European was a superior culture. Um, uh, he was born in Victorian England. So he had some Victorian attitudes. Um, these are things in the negative side of the ledger. And as with all history, you should have a negative and a positive side of the ledger. Positive side of the ledger includes, he almost certainly did more than any one human being to save the world from Nazism. So that should count as something. And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill in this regard is to stress that if you get, I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all. I don't think the revisionism of recent years about Churchill or the founding fathers of America or anyone else is anything I want to stop. I find it interesting. I find interesting, not least cause it's so sloppy on occasions, but I find it interesting and it's important and we should be able to see people in the round, but that includes recognizing the positive side of the ledger. And if you can't recognize that side, you're doing something else. You're doing something else. It's not history. It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind. And I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers. There are some people, for instance, certainly since the nineties who have pushed the Sally Hemings Thomas Jefferson story to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute. As a result, you know, we see Jefferson's statue being removed from the council chamber in the city we're sitting in last November by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson no longer represents our values. If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson and that he had flaws, I mean, that's not a grownup debate. And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time, but let me sort of throw a curveball at you then. What about recognizing the positive and the negative of a fellow with nice facial hair called Karl Marx? Sure. Sure. I mean, I have a section in the war on the West, as you know, where I go for Karl Marx with some glee. So he seems to have gotten some popularity in the West recently. Not just recently. Yeah. I mean, he's had a resurgence recently. Yes, resurgence. Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong, people reach for other options. And when, for instance, it's very hard for people to accumulate capital, it's not obvious that they're going to become capitalists. And so one thing that happens is people say, let's look at the Marxism thing again, see if that's a viable go. My argument would simply be point me to one place that's worked. Well, the argument from the Marxists or the Marxian economists is that we've only really tried it once the Soviets tried it. And then if there's a few people that kind of tried the Soviet thing. Cuba tried it? So they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet. Sure, they tried it. Yes, they've tried it. They tried it in Venezuela. Yes, yes, yes. So let's just quickly say, how did all these experiments go? They did not, well, they failed in fascinating ways. They did, but they failed. Yes, they failed. And we should stress, so grossly failed, so grossly failed that they threw millions and millions of people into completely thwarted lives that were much shorter than they should have been. Yeah. So the lesson to learn there that you can learn several lessons. One is that anything that smells like Marxism is going to lead to a lot of problems. Now another lesson could be, well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had? He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism. So is it possible to do better than capitalism? And that's, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder, that might actually become relevant in, I don't know, 20, 30, 50 years when the machines start doing more and more of the labor, all those kinds of things. You start to ask questions. We finally might get to Marx's dream of what the average day would look like. Yes. Well, there's going to be an awful lot of literary criticism then. If you remember, that's what Marx said that we would be doing in the evenings, the laborer in the evening. Well, he didn't know Twitter was a thing or Netflix. So he would change. Are there things we could learn from Marx? Plausibly, possibly. I can't think of anything myself offhand. But to have a critique of capitalism isn't by any means a bad thing in the society. I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism that showed how you improve capitalism. A critique of free market that showed how people could get better access to the free market. How you could ensure, for instance, that young people get onto the property ladder, things like that. Those are constructive things. The people who say we must have Marxism, I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking about because that never leads to any of those things. Haven't led in the past. It's never led in the past. And at some point, you've got to try to work out how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy before you realize that every attempt always leads to the same thing. We could pretend that fascism has never been properly tried and that it was unfortunate what happened in Nazi Germany. But that wasn't real fascism. And in Mussolini's fascism, it didn't go all that well, but it was a bit better. And maybe we could try a bit more Franco-fascism. Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they. The people who try that are reviled, and quite rightly. So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing? And it's a great mystery to me the way that people do tolerate it. Always, always in this stupid way of saying, we haven't done it yet. If you keep trying the same recipe, and every time it comes out as shit, it's that the recipe is shit. Well, sort of, I'm trying to practice here by playing devil's advocate, practice the same idea that you mentioned, which is when you say the word Marxism, should you throw out everything, or should you ask a question, is there good ideas here? And the same, it's the good, it's weighing the good and the bad, and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully. Sure. Do you know the famous George Orwell comment in an argument with a Stalinist? Do you know? No. That's one of my favorite quotes. George Orwell in the early 40s gets into an argument with a Stalinist, who's obviously a Marxist. And this is after the Show Trials, 37. This is when it's very clear what Marxism in the Russian form is. And Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist, and it goes on and on. And eventually Orwell says, well, what about the Show Trials, and what about what's happened in Ukraine, and the famines, and much more, and the purges, and the purges, and the purges. And eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell what Orwell knows he's going to say all along, which is he says, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. And Orwell says, where's the omelet? Oh, yeah, that's a good, that's a really good. Look at this by this stage, okay? How many- Where's my damn omelet? How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles have the Marxists created by now in country after country? Always next time they're going to produce the great omelet. But they never have, and they never will, because the whole thing is rotten from the start. But let me just also say one thing about, because of course Marx isn't as nice as he sounds. And that's one of the things that I try to highlight in the book is, if we're going to do this reductive thing of people in history and saying, well, they had views that were of their time, and we must therefore condemn them for them. Say, fine, let's do the same thing with Marx. And there are things I quote in this book from Marx's letters, not least the letters to Engels. And indeed in his published writings, he was writing for the American press in the eight and fifties, the way he has horrible views on slavery and colonialism and much more. But the main thing is, I mean, the horrible things he says about black people and the constant use of the N-word. In fact, when I was doing the audio book for the Wall of the West, I had to decide, will I read out the quotes from Marx or not? If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled because people would have just said, you've been using the N-word so much in this passage. And I slightly thought of doing it so that I could say I was only quoting Marx to try to hit the point home. In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to, but Marx's letters are disgusting on these terms. Since I highlighted this in this book and some of the media picked it up and have popularized this thing I'm trying to put into the system, which is if you're going to accuse Churchill of racism, if you're going to accuse Jefferson of racism, Washington of racism and so on, what about Marx? The two things that Marxists have said since this came out has been, first of all, why are you saying this about Marx? He was a man of his time, like everyone else. And the second thing they say is we don't go to Marx for his horrible, abhorrent views on race. They're talking about mixed race people as gorillas and so on. We don't go to him for that. We go to him for his economic theories. I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson for his views on slaves. We don't go to Churchill for the precise language he used that points in the 1910s about Indians. Or his health advice. Or his health advice. Actually, I do get him for that. But I explained so much. But let's have some standards on this. And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact that the people don't do this with Marx. Because I think what some people are trying to do, and this may sound conspiratorial, but I really don't think it is. I think that some people are deliberately trying to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past in order to say there's nothing good, nothing you can hold on to, no one you should revere. You've got no heroes. The whole thing comes down. Who's left standing? Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism. Or the 19th and 20th centuries. And no, no. I will not have the entire landscape deracinated. And then the worst ideas tried again. So basically destroy all of history and the lessons learned from history and then start from scratch and then it's completely any idea can work and then you could just take whatever. Well, and the thing is there are always some people with pre-prepared ideas. And I mentioned this also with the post-colonialists. The post-colonialists were really interesting because when the European powers were moving from Africa and the Far East, post-colonial movements had one obvious move they could have done, which was to say, since the European powers have left, we will return to a pre-colonial life, which in some of their places would have been returning to slave markets and slave ownership and slave selling and much more. But put that aside for a second. They could have said we have an indigenous culture, which we will return to almost uniformly in the post-colonial era. You had figures like France Fanon, you had European intellectuals like Sartre who said the Western powers are retreating from these countries and therefore we should institute in these countries what but Western Marxism. Well, it's not obvious to me that like the bad ideas will be the ones that emerge, but it's more likely that the bad ideas would emerge in this kind of context when you erase history, when you erase tradition. When you erase history and you leave some ideas deliberately un-interrogated. I mean, as I say, find me one in a hundred American students who've heard of any of the communist despots of the 20th century. I mean, name recognition in, there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK and like name recognition among children, school children for Stalin, let alone Mao. I mean, Mao who kills more people than anyone, 65 million Chinese perhaps. How many students in America know what Mao was, who he was, where he was? Nothing. Where the atrocities committed. Where the atrocities were committed. Or. I worry about that because it means that we might have learned one of the two lessons of the 20th century. We think we've learned one of the two lessons of the 20th century. We actually haven't learned that lesson. We've learned a little bit of it and we've not learned the other one at all because that's why we still have people in American politics and elsewhere actually talking about collectivization and things as if there's no problem with that and as if it's perfectly obvious and they could run it and they'd know exactly where to start. What are the two lessons of the 20th century? Fascism and communism. Oh yeah. I mean, I'm not exactly sure what the exactly the lessons are. No, it's not clear. The lessons were very clear that we'd be better at it. Well one is your book broadly applied of madness of crowds. That's one lesson. Well, how so? Meaning like large crowds can display herd like behavior. Yes. Be very suspicious of crowd. Yeah. In general. I mean, you apply it in different more to modern application in a sense, but it's that that's rooted in history that crowds can when, when humans get together, they can do some quite radically silly things. Elias Canetti is very good on that. Crowds and power. And Eric Hoffer, who is a sort of self-taught, amazing, not the autodidactic writer, the true believer and so on. He was extremely good on that. But the reason I mentioned the two things, no, I mean, we should have realized the two nightmares of the 20th century, fascism and communism, that we should know how they came about and we're interested in learning how one of them came about fascism. And we know some of the lessons like don't treat other people as less than you because of their race. That's one lesson. But when we've, we've done some good at learning that. But the second one, not to do communism again, not to do socialism. I think we're way away from knowing because we don't know how it happened. And the, and the little temptations are still there always. Look at the people saying, I'm going to expropriate your property. People do things they don't like. They will get to, we can't wait to take your property. Well there's a sense, there's an appealing sense. Okay. Every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it that sells the ideology. So for socialism, for communism is that there's a, it seems unfair that the working class does all of this work and gets only a fraction of the output. It just seems unfair. So you want to make it, they do get a fraction of the output. Yes. And so it seems to be more fair if we increase that, if the workers own all of the value of their output and well, the things that are more fair seems to be a good thing. I'd say, well, yeah. I mean, fairness is, I like fairness as a, no, I much prefer fairness because it's a much easier thing to try to work out. It's quite amorphous itself as a concept, but everyone can recognize it. So for instance, should the boss of the company earn a million times that of the lowest paid employee doesn't seem fair. Should they earn maybe five or 10 times the salary of the lowest paid employee? Yeah, possibly. That could be fair. There are certain sort of multiples which are within the bounds of, you know, reasonableness. I think actually that's the much bigger problem in capitalism at the moment as I see it is the not untrue perception that a tiny number of people get a lot of the, accrue a lot of the benefits and that the bit in the middle has become increasingly squeezed and is danger always of falling all the way down to the bottom. I mean, I think in the snakes and ladders of American capitalism, for instance, it's a correct perception to say that the snakes go down awfully far. If you tread on the snake, you can plummet an awfully long way in America. And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high and there's a perception and again it's not entirely wrong that the ladders system on the board is kind of broken. So what you're saying is you're a Marxist. I'm not saying I'm a Marxist. You heard that here first in the out of context blog post you're going to write about this. I get back to this point. The way to critique capitalism, if it's gone bad, is to get better capitalists. Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair. Never decide that the answer is the thing that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism. So as you describe in the madness of crowds, the herd-like behavior of humans that gets us into trouble, you as an individual thinker and others listening to this, how can you \\u2013 because all of us are amidst crowds. We're influenced by the society that's around us, by the people that's around us. How can we think independently? How can we \\u2013 if you're in the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 20th century, if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany at the end of the 30s and 40s, how can you think independently? Given first of all that it's hard to think independently, just intellectually speaking, but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous. So the incentive to think independently under the uncertainty that's usually involved with thinking is \\u2013 I mean, it's a silly thing to say. But on Twitter there's a cost to be paid for going against the crowd on any silly thing. We can even talk about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock. There's a crowd that believes that that was unjustified. I forget what the crowd decided. Crowd split on that one. It's safe to have one opinion either way. Okay, it is. Right. But there is \\u2013 you put it very nicely \\u2013 that there's clearly a calculus here and that you can measure on Twitter, in particular you can measure the crowd, a sense of where the crowd lays. Michael Jackson. Well, oh boy. I don't want to \\u2013 this is not a legal discussion. I don't have my lawyer present. I don't even have a lawyer. The man in question is dead. But I think most people who are not just diehard fans would concede that Michael Jackson had a strange relationship with children and was almost certainly a pedophile. Is that \\u2013 did the crowd agree on that? No, the crowd hasn't agreed because he's too famous and we all love thriller. Yeah, we do. So you said people who are not fans, I just don't \\u2013 No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson, but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile. But nobody wants to give up dancing to Bad at weddings. So they just kind of added in. It's fine. Seriously, it's a genius. Your law does not apply to Bill Cosby. Oh, that's \\u2013 well, he wasn't \\u2013 he was, of course, one of the most famous people in America, but maybe he wasn't regarded as talented. Oh, wow. There's depth to this calculation. Oh, yeah. There's a genius opt-out in all cultures. There's a genius opt-out in all cultures. Look at Lord Byron. Lord Byron shagged his sister. Doesn't affect his reputation. In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it. But then again, this kind of war against the West, geniuses actually makes you more likely or no to get canceled. So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson or \\u2013 Well, yes, because if you haven't done anything, remarkable, nobody will come looking for you possibly. Okay. Yeah. Genius can get you in trouble eventually. Okay. Sidle through life with nobody noticing. Be totally harmless and then die and hope you haven't used any carbon. But you were asking about how to survive the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds. And there's a very simple answer to that. Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world. Oh, come on. But this is still human psychology because you want to fit in. There's a \\u2013 Why? Because you like people and you're just as a \\u2013 Why not just like a small number of people and ignore the rest? Yeah, that's \\u2013 That's what I do. Well, I mean, I actually like most people. This isn't a general thing. I don't have detestation for most people at all. Most people I kind of enjoy speaking with and being with. But in terms of storing your sense of self-worth in absolute strangers, big mistake. Yeah. And for me, that's \\u2013 let's turn it into a therapy session. For me, and I think I represent some number of populations, I'm pretty self-critical. I'm looking for myself in the world. And there is a depth of connection with people on the internet. I mean, I have some \\u2013 I think there's a shallowness of it. It's shallow connection. Interesting. I \\u2013 Put it this way. If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help? On the internet? No. No. Good. But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right. Your very close friends would help. Family would help. Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps that's the only thing \\u2013 You can't store significant amounts of trust or faith or belief or self-worth in places which will not return it to you. Okay. So let's talk about the more extreme case, the harsher case. When you talk about the things you talk about in the war on the West and madness of crowds, I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure. As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly with a zen-like look on your face. So you don't \\u2013 all you need is Sam Harris to say that you're brilliant and you're happy. No, I love Sam. I'm deeply pleased when he flatters me and he's nice about me, but no, I don't just rely on Sam. No, I mean, why would I mind? Maybe it's self-selecting. If I didn't have the view I had about that or whatever armory it is that I have on that, I wouldn't do what I did maybe. Have you been to some dark places psychologically because of the challenging ideas you explore? Like significant self-doubt, just kind of \\u2013 I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life. By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind. There's definitely times I've got things wrong and regretted that. There's times I've \\u2013 there was a period around the time I wrote my book, The Strange Death of Europe, which was a very, very dark time. It wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life, but because of the book I was writing. Oh, because of the place you had to go in order to write the book. Well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization. Occasionally now, I have maybe slightly too pat at this stage, but sometimes readers come up to me in the street or whatever and say, you know, I love The Strange Death of Europe and will say, you know, it's a very depressing book to read, however. I would say, well, you should have tried writing it. It was because it has chunks of it, which I'm very proud of in particular, about the death of religion, the death of God, the loss of meaning and the void. That's difficult stuff to write about and to grapple with. There is a sort of \\u2013 I haven't reread that book since it came out, but I think there are passages in it which reveal what I was thinking very clearly in the poetry of it as it were, as well as the detail. But yeah, I can't say \\u2013 I'm used to saying what I think and what I see. And if there's any pushback I've got from that, I'm completely consoled that I'm saying what I see with my own eyes. That's your source of strength, is that you're always seeking the truth as best you see it. Well, I can't agree to go along with a lie if I've seen something with my own eyes. Do you ever \\u2013 so speaking of Sam Harris, and I mentioned to you offline, a lot of people \\u2013 I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you as their example of a very smart person. So given that compliment, do you ever worry that your ego grows to a level where you're not \\u2013 what you think is the truth is no longer the truth. Is this kind of \\u2013 it blinds you. And also, on top of that, the fact that you stand against the crowd often, that there's part of it that appeals to you, that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes. I get a certain thrill from the friction. Yeah, that sometimes both your ego and the thrill of friction will get you to deviate from the truth and instead just look for the friction. Could do. Could do for sure. I try to keep alive to that. Early in my career, I realized that, for instance, I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily any more than strictly necessary because there was a very large number of already necessary enemies. And I remember once \\u2013 I won't go into the details, but I already had one sort of thing I'd done that week, and then another thing came out. I just thought, I can't do that. And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person who's forever creating storms. And I tried to make sure I wasn't. And I think I pretty much stuck to that. But to answer your question, well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be that I wouldn't fall into the trap you described for two reasons. I mean, one is that I don't think of myself as a wildly intelligent person, partly because I'm very, very aware of the things I know nothing about. I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge of the details of finance or economic theory. I mean, the real details. I don't mean the big picture of the kind that we were just discussing earlier. If you put the periodic table in front of me, I would struggle to do more than a handful. I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge. And where I have gaps or chasms, I tend to find I have a disproportionate admiration for the people who know that stuff. Like I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money, really understand it. I think, how the hell do you do that? And the same thing with biologists, medics, stuff I just know very little about. And that's a source of humility for you, just knowing that. Yes. I mean, I think, well, I'm going to get on that stuff. But Jesus, if you got me on the general knowledge, I would say that thing some years ago, there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge. I was asked some years ago on to, there's a sort of psych celebrity, one of former students of the universities or colleges asked to go back for the Christmas special. And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one. And the only reason I actually wanted to do it was because I discovered that Louis Theroux had been to my college before my time and he'd agreed to be on the team. And I thought I'd love to meet Louis Theroux, that'd be great fun. And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don't want to do it. And they said, come on, you'd be great. I said, I wouldn't, I'd show myself up to be a total asshole and ignoramus. And as it was, I sat down my flat and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge. I just sat mute for the whole half hour. I just couldn't, the first question was about physics and the second one was about, as it was, I watched the one and I could answer the first two or three questions of the one that actually went out because they made it a bit simpler. But I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the, and I said to the producers, I said, I can't go on because I just couldn't answer the questions. These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer a whole range of things. So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations and you can't apply your limitations. Yeah, and they're forever before me, you know, not hard to find in every day. And then on top of that, I suppose it's, in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling's alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem, If. There's a line- You just enjoy a good poem, can you? Well, no, it's not, I can enjoy a great poem, but I mean, a good poem. This is slightly off. This goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky. Take Douglas's criticism with a grain of salt. Maybe I've heard it read at too many memorial services and things, but that line is a good piece of advice. If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster and meet these, greet these two imposters just the same. That's a good line. It's a good line, as Kipling often did, an amazing turn of the line. But I do think that it's a very sensible thing to try to greet triumph and disaster and regard them as imposters and greet them just the same. And actually anyone who knows me knows that I never, partly it's because I have a sort of belief in the old gods and at the moment that I thought that I was at the moment of triumph, the fates would hitch up their skirts and run at me at a million miles an hour. But it's also because I, anyone who knows me knows I never have a moment when I say that's just great. I feel totally fulfilled and victorious. I mean, it happened to me recently when the war on the west went straight in at number one in the bestseller list. How long did that last in terms of your self-satisfaction? Didn't happen. Not even for a brief moment. No. When I first saw that it was selling, I had that moment of elation. I thought, good, I've done it, it's out. And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely, but it doesn't last partly because I tell myself it mustn't last. Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt. Is that skirts? You brits with your poetry, even when it's nauseating. As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis of the political leadership and the human mind and the human being of Donald Trump? I sort of avoided this for years. Just talking about Trump. I tried to avoid talking about Trump for years. It's the same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit. Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent, do you think the Trump story is over or are we just done with volume one? I have no idea the people I know who know him say that he's running. And I think that in general, Republicans do have a choice in front of them. One friend put it to me recently said, you've got to go in with your toughest fighter. And I understand that instinct. And I also think it's very dangerous instinct, because what if your toughest fighter is also your biggest liability? What's the best way to get it out of the Democrat vote in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running? And the people that are doing the war in the West are pretty tough fighters. They are. And I'm cautious about this because I know every way I tread is dangerous. But let me just be frank. Tread gracefully. I'll tread as gracefully as I can. My Wellington boots. My galoshes. Here's the thing. I think everybody knows what Trump is. I think we all knew for years. And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend that he was something he wasn't. I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend that, for instance, he was some devout Christian or a man of faith or a man of great integrity or all of these sorts of things. Because in the public eye for years, it had been obvious that wasn't the case. But he has something extraordinary. One thing is a method of communication that you've just got to say is, was unbelievable. In one fundamental way that you can't look away for some reason. Can't look away. I mean, watching him clear everyone out of the way in 2016 was thrilling because those people needed clearing away. You know, it's just horrifying. What America is going to give us another Bush? What's so great about this family? America is going to give us another Clinton. We're going to choose to bring Clinton on the Bush. Mark Stein said, whatever, we'll just wait for the day that Clinton is in the Bushes into Marion and then we can really have a monarchy again. So I was very pleased to see him clear them away. I was very pleased to see him sort of raise some of the issues that needed raising. I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air and I wished it wasn't him doing it. And then there was the question of him governing and it was just perfectly clear he didn't know how to govern. What he did have, however, what he does have is an incredible ability to fight. And some of the forces he was arraigned against were arraigned against him. My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else. I mean, they'd have probably done some similar BS against Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. They'd have said, some people admitted, they'd have accused all these people of racism and misogyny and everything else as well, just like they did Mitt Romney, just like they did John McCain. But Trump was the one ugly enough and bruisey enough to fight. And also a willingness or a lack of willingness to play sort of the civil game of politics or at a party when like politeness gets you in trouble. You show up and everybody's polite and you just out of momentum want to be polite. And all of a sudden you're on an island with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you into a huge amount of trouble. But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities, but I just, you know, look, he screwed up during his time in office because he didn't achieve as much as he should have done. Now you could say that about every president, but I refuse to acknowledge that two years when he had both houses in the first, the beginning, he just didn't know what levers to pull. You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news. I'm sorry, that's not a president. And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions because people knew, I mean, people who were very loyal to him, he would just, you know, he'd get them to do something loyal and then destroy them. And I think, and then we get onto the thing about, and here we get onto the, you know, that of course is very, very fractures to rain, but you know, I covered the 2020 election and I was traveling all around the States and I went to Trump rally and, and all sorts of stuff. And I, I was in DC on election night and, um, went and it got very ugly at one point, um, in so-called black lives matter Plaza. When it looked like Trump might win, when Florida came in and got really, I could feel the air were very, very heated and like some Antifa people started getting into black block and this sort of stuff. And I thought this town is going to burn, you know, if Trump wins. And in the aftermath of the vote, I was willing to hang around in Washington for a bit. And then I saw it was going to drag on. And I saw some of his people and others and people told me they had great evidence of vote rigging and all this sort of thing. And I'm afraid I'm one of those people who doesn't believe that the evidence that they presented is good enough to justify the claim that he won the election. And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules and have you seen it? Look, the evidence isn't there that the, that the election was won by Donald Trump. And I think that what he did on January the 6th was unbelievably dangerous. And you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas in our head at the same time. January the 6th was not nothing, nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup. And there's a vanishing number of people in the U S or as Eric Weinstein said, it's like, this is the roof that you have to walk along. And like the sides are very steep. If you fall off either side. Is there some sense given the forces that are waging war in the West? He said this feeling perhaps because of Antifa or something else that this town is going to burn and maybe a continued feeling that this town is going to burn with the January 6th events. Are you worried about the future of the United States in the coming years because of the, there's a feeling of escalation. Is that just a war of Twitter or is there, is there a real brewing of something? Oh, it's real. And how, well, let me then respond to that. How, what is the hopeful, if you, if you 10 years from now, look back at the United States and say, we turned it around, what would be the reason? What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so? I'll tell you, since I, since I wrote this book, there are two things in particular that I've been really pleased that a specific type of specialist has approached me on to say that things I've written about actually have more application than I realized. One is the gratitude issue. A number of people have approached me who have gone through AA, alcoholics anonymous. They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA? And I said, that's a bit personal question. But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say, well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation or alcohol anonymous, uh, uh, no McDonald's doesn't sound very anonymous. You stand up in a room, you say your name and you tell everyone the worst things you've ever done. That's the opposite of anonymous. Anyhow, but they say, uh, look, because if you go to these things, apparently you're asked to as part of your recovery, say what you're grateful for, like list what you're grateful for. I didn't know that by the way, until, until, until the book was out. And so it turned out to have more applications than I knew. The other thing though, is that I say that it's absolutely crucial in America that we try to find things that we agree on. And a couple of times since the book came out, I've been approached by people who have marriage counselors. Um, but we've also said, I mean, if you've ever been through marriage counseling, again, that's a very personal question. Stop asking me personal questions. No, but they, and I said, well, why? And he, well, because this is, this is one of the things that we do in couples therapy is try to find things you agree on. And I think this is very important in America and it's made much harder by the fact. And I've said this many times, but forgive me if I'm repeating myself, but it's made much harder by the fact that having different opinions is very last century. Now we all have different facts or at least the two sides have different facts. One half of the country roughly, or let's say 40%, 30% whatever you want to put it with a tired minority in the middle. One segment of the country believes that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election and that the Russians interfered and got Donald Trump into power. Another half of the country believes that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. If you can't agree on who wins elections, it's very hard to see who you, what you agree on as a country. That's one of the reasons I mind the war on American history and Western history is one of the things you have to agree on is at least some attitude towards your past. You don't have to go on everything, but like the public square has to have public heroes who are agreed to be heroes to some extent, warts and all. If you don't have that, if actually you think for instance like half the country thinks founding fathers were pretty good, the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten racists and so on. If half the country basically thinks it would have been better if Columbus had taken a different turn, never found America, gone back home and said nothing out there, that would have been better. And the other half is pretty glad in the end that we've got America. We've got to agree on something. And I just see in America, so I do think we've got to try to find things to agree on, like a reasonable attitude towards the past. That's why that matters. And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say that everything in the American past was good. God knows that wouldn't stand up to a second scrutiny or self scrutiny. But nor was it all bad. This wasn't a country formed in sin and in an eradicable sin. It wasn't founded in 1619 in order to make the country wicked and incapable of escaping that wickedness. These are things that will matter enormously in the years ahead. Because if you can't agree on anything, including who your heroes are, the whole thing is just one massive division. And we'll see what I think we're already seeing, which is people basically going to states where it's more like the life they want to live. And some people say to me, well, that's okay. And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that. That's possible, but it's also it eradicates part of what has been American public life, which is the ability to look at each other and discuss face to face. And I see things like this bomb placed under America the other week with the Supreme Court League, the draft league, as being just a further example of that. I'm very, very worried about it in America. And because if America screws up everything, everything else in the world goes. Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded and has been able to live out in better and better forms, sort of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles versus- With the desire to improve. Yeah, constantly. An imperfect union. Yeah. Well, as I generally have hope that people want to sort of, in terms of gratitude, people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful. It's a better life psychologically. The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within. So I just feel that people will long for that and will find that. That's the American way. Same with the division that we reveal now has to do with new technologies like social media that kind of is a small kind of deviation from the path we're on because it's a new, we've got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons. Which is relatively new. But we need to find reasonable attitudes towards these things. That's why I say it matters how you and my feedback on social media because we're all going through it to some extent. We're learning. And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad. I say this, that was my minimalist call to friends in this era was the main job is not to go insane. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, like walk towards sanity. Because I'm sure there's a Hunter S. Thompson quote in there. Insanity on the weekends can be at least fun. Okay. Do you have advice for young people that just put down their tech talk and are listening to this podcast in high school and college about how to have a career or how to have a life they can be proud of? So a broad question, but of course, I mean, I can give specific advice for people who want to be writers and so on, but that's a bit niche maybe. Well, writers will be very interesting, sorry to interrupt. Also how to put your ideas down on paper and think that the ideas develop them and have the guts to go to a large audience. Especially when the ideas are sort of controversial or dangerous or difficult. Well, the main thing to do is to read. When I was a schoolboy, I would ever have a book in my pocket, side pocket of my jacket on his side pocket and would read. And that wasn't just so swattish in some way, but because I discovered probably at some point in my early teens, I discovered something I wrote about this once. I discovered that books were dangerous, which was a thrilling discovery. I discovered they could contain anything. And also people didn't know what you were reading. I remember I got far too young an age. I read the Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley and I didn't make head or tail of it probably, but I knew that it was about something really interesting and dangerous. And I thought constantly when I read poetry or read history, I was just constantly thrilled and wanted to know more. And if you want to become a writer, you have to be a reader. You have to read the best stuff. And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is and you'll find the people that really impress you. But I know I just came across certain writers who just knocked me off my feet. And when you find those people, read everything and cling on to them and find other people like that, find other writers like that, people who are connected by history or scholarship or circles or whatever. For you, was it fiction or nonfiction? Is there a particular book that you just remember where it just gave you pause? Well, I remember that the first book that absolutely threw me was The Lord of the Flies by William Golding, which used to be a signed text and everyone's a bit snotty about because it's so popular. But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book I read in that I had been used to the world of children's literature, of everything ends up fine in the end, the lost all get found. This was the first book I read where that's not the case, where the world turns out differently. And I remember for days afterwards, I was just in a state of shock. I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered. And partly because I sort of intuited it must be true. And of course, that is not to say that The Lord of the Flies, there's lots of scholarship on what children do in the situation of being on the island or when they do congregate and anyhow. But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world. And it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it. It was dangerous. And it was dangerous. And then of course, when I became interested in sex, let alone when I realized I was gay, I realized books were a very, very good way to learn about what I was. And that was even more dangerous in a way. And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know. You discovered sex? That was an invention in books? What do you mean? No, what I mean is that one of the things that gay people have when they're growing up is that you have this terribly big secret and you don't think the world will ever know, you hope the world will never know. And it's been called by one psychologist, the little boy with a big secret. And so if you discover that other people have the same secret, there's a sort of, thank God for that. But I mean, that's just a version of what everybody gets in reading in a way, which is the thrill of discovery that somebody else thought something you thought only you'd thought. I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature is when a voice comes from across the centuries and seems to leave a handprint. It makes you feel a little bit less alone because somebody else feels, sees the world the same way, is the same way. That's what C.S. Lewis said to have said, we read to know we're not alone. But we don't only read to know we're not alone, we read to become other people. I mean, I think I saw in books a version of the life I wanted to live and then I decided to live it. And I'm fortunate enough to have done so. I wanted to live in the world of ideas and books and debate. I wanted to live in the debates of my time. And I remember when, like a lot of people, I read Auden when I was young. And certain lines obviously stuck with me. But that poem of his, which everybody knows and which he hated, September 1st, 1939, I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me. I was sitting on a dive for a second as we degraded and alone at the end of a low, dishonest decade. But of course, there's a problem with that line, which is you kind of want to be living at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well. It sounds sort of cool in a way. You're the only person who sees it. But so yeah, anyhow, that's the diversion. But the point is, if you want to be a writer, you've got to be a reader. And from anything else, you discover the the lilt of language and the things you can do. And I've read people who, and I still do, who I think, my God, I didn't know, how did you do that? In fact, books for me now and articles and other things fall into two categories. One is I know how you did that. And the other is I don't know how you did that. And the best feeling as a writer is when you do the second one. And it happens occasionally in my writing life. Will you almost like return to something you've written or like right after you know, the moment you write it, you wonder how did I do that? Yes. That's that's the most I've never said that before. That's the happiest thing in writing. Yeah, very occasionally it sounds but I mean, I've occasionally finished something. Funny enough, it happened some years ago in a long piece I wrote about the artist Basquiat. I finished the piece and I gasped. I didn't know because because that's also a thing with writing is you you it's not sometimes people say you need to write in order to know what you think. That's not quite true. Sometimes you that's a very bad piece of advice for some writers who don't know what they think and it's not going to become clear if they just start typing. But yeah, sometimes it is true that you there's a thought that's just waiting there and a clarity that comes across and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain and by the time you typed it you you just go. Yes. That's the greatest feelings. Almost like it came from somewhere else. That's what Bakunin says about you know, what's the moment is Tom Stoppard's favorite quote about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment where the writer's pen when he pauses, where does he go in that moment? Yeah, that's so interesting. Because I think the answer to that question will help us explain consciousness and all those other weird things about the human mind. So that was advice for writers. I didn't really give any advice for people in general. Is that oh you want to give health advice? No. To channel Churchill and... No, I don't want to give health advice. Clearly because you implied that Churchill was one of your early guides in that aspect. So when you discovered your sexuality, let me ask about love. Too personal, far too personal of a question to ask a Brit. But what was that like and broadly speaking, what's the role of love in the human condition? Sex and love and for you personally, discovering that you were and maybe telling the world that you were gay. I'm very perilously personal. I do actually have a sort of rule that I don't talk about in my personal life. Rules are meant to be broken. Okay, well I'll break it a little bit. One of the ways in which growing up and realizing you're gay differs from growing up and being straight is that it's almost inevitable that your first passions will be unrequited. Oh wow, I never thought about that. Now that's not to say, I mean, there's plenty of unrequited love among young men for young women, young women for young men, plenty of that. But it's almost inevitable if you're gay that your first passions will be totally unrequited because the odds are that the person in question will not be gay. So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak. Is heartbreak and disappointment. Heartbreak can be beautiful too. It's formative. Well, again, it comes back to the thing if you're a writer or something, because you can always do something with it. That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted. I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here. No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers because you always think, well, I could use that. It's dangerous. It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware of it. It's almost like a drug, right? No, it's not like a drug. It's the fear that all things, even the greatest suffering, it could be material. What's the danger in that exactly? That seeing the material in the human experience, you don't experience it fully? You don't experience it fully and you might be using it. I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s. And he said he knew at the moment he was told about his friend's death, a tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem. And he did and the poem was wonderful, but there's always that slight guilt for writers of am I going to use that? Anyhow, that's a divergence. Life is full of guilty pleasures. And I think that's one of them because if you feel that guilt, really what you're doing is you're capturing that moment and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people by writing about that moment because it's going to stimulate something that resonates with those people because it's similar kinds of memories about a loss and a passion towards somebody that they had to lose. So don't, you know, yes, but there is a good sign. More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones or bad places and wanting to find bad stories because it's useful. And there is a definite guilt you get from that sort of thing. Like the worse the situation, the more useful. Anyhow, no, so that's, that's sort of the only difference that happens from growing up being gay. And it means that most, certainly in my generation, most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later. And there's lots of explanations of that maybe being one of the reasons for perceived or otherwise promiscuity among gay men, which is I think more easily persuaded by the fact that gay men behave like men would if women were men. That's one explanation, but it's both a feature and a bug that you come to sexual flourishing later in life that could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life, that could be a positive or a negative. But what's broadly speaking is the role of love in the human condition, Douglas. Well it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point. What is the point? What's, what's the meaning of life? Let's go there. So what's the meaning is a hard one, of course. Where is the meaning is slightly easier. And I'd say that everyone can find that. You gravitate towards the places you find meaning. Now there's a conservative answer to this, which is quite useful and it's certainly more useful than any others because the conservative answer is find meaning where people have found it before. Which is a very, very good answer. If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship or a particular canon of work, go there because it's been proven by time to be able to give you the goods. It's much more sensible than saying, hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning. But love is, love is probably the nearest thing we can have to the divine on earth. And of course, the problem of what exactly, what type of love we mean is an issue. Well, that goes to the fact that you don't like definitions anyway. I do like definitions. I just think they need to be pinned down, but let's not go there at the moment because it's... Let's not pin down love at the moment? Well, no, because as you know, I mean, because of the different varieties of love and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture and that it means an awful lot of things and we don't delineate it well. But let's say human love with the greatest fulfillment in sexual love with another person is probably the greatest intimation you can have of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love. And it's the sense that all young lovers have, which is that they've just walked through the low door in the garden and found themselves in bliss. And that this is... There's a beautiful, beautiful poem of... Can I read it to you? Yes, please. I'll try to find it. There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkin's, which slightly says what I'm... And try not to duck your question by referring to other people, but... Maybe that's the best way to answer the question. Could be. Is to read a poem. So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows, which is remarkable because he came to sexual... He had a rather unhappy sex life, but he came to sexual fruition in the 40s and 50s and all the hell that that involved. And he took what I regard as being a really remarkable and important view on the sexual revolution in the 60s, which is that most people who he's generated, most older people resented the young. They resented the freedom they had and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible and it was always getting lurkily. And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly, he was a very conservative person, took a different view and he says it in his poem. And the opening of the poem is he says, when I see a couple of kids and guess he's fucking her and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm, I know this is paradise. One old is dreamed of all their lives, bonds and gestures pushed to one side like an outdated combine harvester and everyone young going down the long slide to happiness endlessly. I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought that will be the life no God anymore or sweating in the dark about hell and that or having to hide what you think of the priest. He and his lot will all go down the long slide like free bloody birds. And immediately rather than words comes the thought of high windows, the sun comprehending glass and beyond it, the deep blue air that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless. The divine, he found it. He found it in seeing a couple of young kids and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm. Do you see it? I mean, it's first of all, it's very counterintuitive. But secondly, this is the point that sex had been so tied up with misery. I mean, people don't remember this now when they talk about the past. I mean, there's one of my favorite books, Stefan's likes the world of yesterday, including the descriptions of what it was like trying to have sex in pre first world war Vienna, you know, all the men ended up going to female prostitutes. They, you know, so many of them got syphilis and this was their first experience with sex. It was so goddamn awful and they were stuck with it all their lives. And so there's lots of stuff that's gone better in our last century. That's one of them. But you ask about love. Yes, I do think that love is basically the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine. And by the way, sex, liberating sex doesn't buy you love. No, I mean, it throws in an entirely, it threw in another set of problems. If there's any meaning on top of all of that is we like to find problems and solve that as a human species. And sometimes we even create problems. Douglas, thank you for highlighting all the problems of human civilization and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future. This is an incredible conversation. Thank you for talking today. It's a huge honor. Thank you. It's very kind of you to say that. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Douglas Murray to support this podcast. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from Douglas Murray himself. This agreement is not oppression. Argument is not assault. Words, even provocative and repugnant ones are not violence. The answer to speech we do not like is more speech. Thank you for listening.

I really believe that. I think worrying about a \\u201ctarget audience\\u201d can make you too preoccupied with things that don\\u2019t matter. You need to be thinking about emotion.\\n\\nEmotion plays no matter what audience you\\u2019re writing for.\\n\\nSecond, the term \\u201ctarget audience\\u201d puts you in a box.

You got to write to freelancers in their 20\\u2019s. It gives you no freedom to dabble, and that can get really draining as a writer.\\n\\nThird, most folks only have three or four topics they really want to write about anyway. For me that\\u2019s travel, writing, life lessons, and relationships. These are my four topics. You\\u2019ll never read a cooking article from me. I don\\u2019t care about that.\\n\\nIf you free yourself from boundaries as a writer, you\\u2019ll arrive at your target audience organically. Who is my target audience? People like me, I suppose!\\n\\nFourth, too much emphasis on \\u201ctarget audience\\u201d can dehumanize you to your audience. What makes Shannon Ashley so endearing for me is the fact that she writes such personal sh*t.\\n\\nThat humanizes her. That makes me want to read her more, no matter what she decides to focus on, because I love her and want to support her.\\n\\nIf I just gave you more freelancing tips every blog post, that\\u2019s fine, but I\\u2019m not anything more than a teacher to my audience. By writing more personal stuff, I become something much more. I become not only helpful, but relatable. I become less of a teacher and more of a friend.\\n\\nAnd who do you want to hang out with more?

You've got no heroes. The whole thing comes down. Who's left standing? Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism. And no, no, you will not have the entire landscape deracinated. And then the worst ideas tried again. The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray, author of The Madness of Crowds, Gender, Race and Identity, and his most recent book, The War in the West, How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason. He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker who points out and pushes back against what he sees as the madness of our modern world. I should note that the use of the word Marxism and the West in this conversation refers primarily to cultural Marxism and the cultural values of Western civilization, respectively. This is in contrast to my previous conversation with Richard Wolff where we focused on Marxism as primarily a critique of capitalism and thus looking at it through the lens of economics and not culture. Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite of each other with very different perspectives on how we build a flourishing civilization together. I leave it to you, the listener, to think and to decide which is the better way. This is the Lex Friedman Podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray. You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West, which in part says that the values, ideas, and history of Western civilization are under attack. So let's start with the basics. Historically and today, what are the ideas that represent Western civilization? The good, the bad, the ugly. I actually don't get stuck on definitions precisely because as you know, once you get stuck on definitions, there's a possibility you'll never get off them. Yes. I'd say a few things. Firstly, obviously the Western tradition is a specific tradition, a specific tradition of ideas, culture, well known to be perhaps easily defined by the combination of Athens and Jerusalem, the world of the Bible, and the world of ancient Greece and indeed Rome. Effectively creates European civilization, which itself spawns the rest of the Western civilizations, America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand. And others. But these are the main countries that we still refer to as the West. So there's a specific tradition and all the things that come from it. My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say, you know when you're not in it. So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai, you know you're not in the West, somewhere else. You know you're not in the West. When you're in Tokyo, somewhere extraordinary, but you know you're not in the West. Obviously there are, let's say borderline questions like is Russia in the West? Which I sort of leave open as a question. Possibly if you were placed into Moscow blindfolded and you woke up and you couldn't hear the language or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like, would you, would you guess you were in the West or not? I think I was somewhere near it. Getting closer. I mean, you know, it's also asked the question, doesn't it, whether it's European. And I think the answer to that is not really, although massively influenced by Europe, but and times wanting to reach towards it at times wanting to stay away, but a part of the West, possibly, yes. But anyway, it's a very specific tradition. It's one of a number of major traditions in the world and because it's hard to define doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Are there certain characteristics and qualities about the values and the ideas that define it is, is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure? Yes. I mean the rule of law, property owning democracies and much more. I mean, these are of course things that were ended up being developed in America and then given back to much of the rest of the West. I say there are other perhaps more controversial attributes I would give to the West. One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which is not shared of course by every other culture. The late philosopher George Steiner said he could never get out of his head the haunting fact that the boats only seemed to go out from Europe. They didn't, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists, the people who wanted to discover other civilizations and indeed even resurrect ancient civilizations and lost civilizations. These were scholars that were always coming from the West to discover this elsewhere. By contrast, there were never boats coming from Egypt to help the Anglo-Saxons discover the origins of their language and so on. So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest in the rest of the world, which can be said to be a Western attribute, although it of course also has, one should immediately preface it, some downsides and many criticisms that can be made of some of the consequences of that interest because of course it's not entirely lacking in self-interest. So it's not just the scholars, it's also the armies. The armies, and they're looking to gain access and control over resources elsewhere. The markets. And hence the imperial imperative. Exactly. To conquer, to expand. Although that itself of course is a universal thing. I mean, no civilization I think that we know of doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors where it can. The Western ability to go further, faster certainly gave an advantage in that regard. Do some civilizations get a bit more excited by that kind of idea than others? Possible. It's possible. But you could say it's the Western civilization because the technological innovation was more efficient, doing that kind of thing. Absolutely. But maybe it wanted it more too. Well the Ottomans wanted it an awful lot and did terribly well for many centuries. One shouldn't forget that. As did others. I'd also say by the way, and again it's a very broad one, but it's worth throwing out there, I think self-criticism is an important attribute of the Western mind. One that as you know is not common everywhere. Not all societies allow even their most vociferous critics to become rich. So you know, criticism is a negative sounding word. It could be self-introspection, self-analysis, self-reflection. And it can be what you need. You know, and in the Western system I'd argue that one of the advantages of the system of representative governance is that where there are problems in the system, you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means. We listen to arguments, most famously in America in the late 20th century. The civil rights movement achieved its aims by force of moral argument and persuaded the rest of the country that it had been wrong. It's not common in every society by any means. So I think there are certain attributes to the Western mind that you could say are, they're not entirely unique, but they are not as commonplace elsewhere. What about the emergence in hierarchies of asymmetry of power, most visible, most drastic in the form of slavery, for example? Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery. I don't regard it as being a unique Western sin. It's rather hard to think of a civilization in history that didn't have slavery of some kind. One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day is that people seem to imagine that our societies in the West were the only ones who ever engaged in any vices. Alas, this isn't true. It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake, or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau, that everybody else in the world was born into sort of Edenic innocence and only we in the West had this sort of evil in us that caused us to do bad things to other people. Slavery was engaging by everyone in the ancient world, of course, and through most of the modern world as well. Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today, so it's clearly not something that the species as a whole has a problem with. That's more slaves, of course, than there were in the 19th century. And I'd say on top of that, the interesting thing about the Western mind as regards to slavery is that we were the civilization that did away with it. And by the way, the founding fathers of America who today are lambasted routinely for being acquiescent in the slave trade, engaging in it, owning slaves. People almost don't even bother now to recognize the facts that Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, all wanted to see this trade done away with. Couldn't hold the country together at the origins if they'd have made such an effort and believed and hoped that it would be something that would be dealt with after their time. So the founding ideas had within them the notion that we should, as a people, get rid of this. The founding lines of the Declaration of Independence set up the conditions under which slavery will be impossible. All men are created equal. Once you've put that, that's a time bomb under the whole concept of slavery. That's ticking away. Okay. And sure enough, it detonated in the next century. If we just step back and look at the human species, what does slavery teach you about human nature? The fact that slavery has appeared as a function of society throughout human history. There are two possibilities. One is it's what people think they can do when God's not watching. Another is it's what they can do if they think that God allows it. Really, really well put. And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation, what does that mean? Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way. There are people who get to work for free. Because economic in nature in some sense. Yes. But in order to do it, I mean, almost always, there are some examples in the ancient world where this wasn't the case, but almost always it had to be a subjugated people or people regarded as different. One of the things actually I've tried to sort of inject into the discussion through this book among other things is a recognition that there were very major questions still going on in the 18th and early 19th century that were unresolved, which were one of the reasons why slavery was not as morally repugnant to people then as it is to us now. And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis. At the time of Thomas Jefferson, the founding fathers were thinking and working. They didn't know, because nobody knew whether the human races were related or not. There were arguments, the monogenesis argument that we were all indeed from the same racial stock. Polygenesis argument was that we weren't. Black Africans, Ethiopians, they're often referred to at the time because they provided some of the first slaves, were different from white Europeans, simply not related in any way. And that makes it easier, of course, that makes it easier to enslave people if you think they're not your brother. Am I my brother's keeper? No, he's not your brother. And it was a very troubling argument in the 18th and 19th century also because there was a biblical question. It threw up a theological question, which was, I mean, people were literally debating this at the time. Was there also a black Adam and Eve? Was there as it were an Indian Adam and Eve, the Native American Adam and Eve? This was a serious theological debate because they didn't know the answer. People say that Darwin solved this. It wasn't just Darwin, of course, but by the late 19th century, the argument that we were not all related, that human beings had suffered so many blows that you had to really be very, very ignorant, deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then. So it no longer was after Darwin, a theological question, it became a moral question. It was already a moral question, but it clarified, Darwin clarifies it definitely. And then you're in this, as I say, you're in a situation of you're not subjugating some other people, you're subjugating your own kin. And that becomes morally unsustainable. So given that slavery in America is part of its history, how do we incorporate into the calculus of policy today, social discourse, what we learn in school? We can look at slavery in America. We can look at maybe more recent things like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust. How do we incorporate that in terms of how we create policy, how we treat each other, all those kinds of things? What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities, the injustices of the past into the way we are today? That's a very complex question because it's a moral question at this point and a moral question long after the fact. I say at one point in the war in the West that the argument, for instance, on reparations now that goes on and is not a fringe argument anymore. Some people say, oh, you're pulling up this fringe argument. It really isn't. I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 2020 was willing to talk about the possibility of reparations. I'm very eager that this country, America, goes through that entirely self-destructive exercise. I say that there's a lot of problems with this, but if I could refine it out of one thing, I'd say this. It's no longer about a wealth transfer from one group of people who did something wrong to another group of people who were wronged. It would have been that, could have been that 200 years ago. Today it's not even the descendants of people who did something wrong giving money to people who were the descendants of people who were wronged. It's a wealth transfer from people who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past to another group of people who resemble people who were wronged. That's impossible to do. I'm completely clear about this. There is no way in which you could organize such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons. It's filled with people who have the same skin color as us, for instance, who have no connection to the slave trade and should not be made to pay money to people who have some connection. Then the country is also filled with ethnic minorities who have come after slavery, who would not be due for any reimbursement, as it were. The problem with this is, though, is that I'm perfectly open to the possibility that there are residual inequities that exist in American life and that the consequences of slavery could be one of the factors that resulted from this. The thing is, I don't think it's a single issue answer. I think it's a multidimensional issue, something like Black Underachievement in America. It's obviously a multidimensional issue. Much of the left and others wish to say it's not. It's only about racism. They can't answer why Asians who've arrived more recently don't, for instance, get held down by white supremacy. But actually, I say white supremacy in quotes, obviously. But don't get held back by it, but actually flourish to the extent that Asian Americans have higher household earnings and higher household mean equity than white Americans. So I don't think that on the merits, the evidence is there that racism is the explanation for Black ongoing Black underachievement in some segments of the Black community in America. It's obviously a part of it. Would you say that even those things like fatherlessness and similar family breakdown issues are a long-term consequence of it? Possibly, but it's being awfully generous to people's ability to make bad decisions. For instance, how many generations after the Holocaust would you allow people to claim that everything that went wrong in the Jewish community was as a result of the Holocaust? Is there some kind of term limit on this? I would have thought so. And I think most people probably think that's over. I think the details matter there. But it's very difficult. We're in deep waters here. Oh, I enjoy swimming out in the ocean. Although I'm terrified of what's lurking underneath in the darkness. You're right. You're right to be. Okay. It's really complicated calculus with the Holocaust and with slavery. So the argument in America is that there's deep institutional racism against African Americans that's rooted in slavery. And so however that calculus turns out, that calculation, it still persists in the culture, in the institutions, in the allocation of resources, in the way that we communicate in subtle ways, in major ways, all that kind of stuff. How is it possible to win or lose that argument of how much institutional racism there is that's rooted in slavery? Is it a winnable? It's an unquantifiable argument. And I'd like to apply some shortcuts to some of this. For instance, all, let's take the EV1 that's most often cited. If a white person is walking down a street in America and they see a group of young black men coming towards them and it's late at night and they cross the road, is it because of slavery? Is it because of institutional racism? No, it's because they've made a calculus based not entirely on unfounded beliefs that given crime rates, it's possible that this group of people might be a group of people they don't want to meet late at night. That's an ugly fact, but as crime statistics in American cities are from American cities bear out, it's not an entirely unreasonable one. It's not reasonable every time, obviously, obviously. But is it attributable to slavery? It's a stretch. If you're in a city like Chicago where the homicide rates shot up in the last two years, albeit again, as always has to be remembered, mainly black on black gun violence and knife violence. Nevertheless, if you're in a city like Chicago, and you make that calculus, I've just suggested the cliched one, the street late at night, there are other factors other than a memory of slavery that kick in. And I'm afraid it's something which people don't want to particularly acknowledge in America for obvious reasons, because it's the ugliest damn debate in the world. But I was actually just writing in my column in the New York Post today about a very interesting case that's sort of similar, which is the question of obesity in the US. As you know, America is the most overweight country in the world. America has I think, 40% of the population is obese in medical ways and the nearest next country is a long way down. That's New Zealand, 30% of the population. So America is a long way ahead. Why during the coronavirus era when we know that obesity is the one clearest factor that's likely to lead to your hospitalization if you also get the virus? Why did almost no public health information in America focus on obesity? 80% of the people who ended up hospitalized in America with coronavirus were obese. We locked the schools when there was no evidence that the coronavirus was deadly for children. We all wore cloth masks when there was very little evidence that this was much use in stopping the spread of the virus. We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem and we never addressed it. Why? Is it just because we worried about fat people? No, it's actually because about fat shaming as it were. No, it's also because to a great extent it's a racial issue in America as well. And actually I quoted this new publication from the University of Chicago as it happens, which makes that claim explicit. It says, the reasons why people have views that are negative about obesity is because of racism and slavery. This is what everything is drawn back to in America. Anything you want to stop, you say it's because of racism, it's because of slavery. How about it's actually because you mind the hospitals getting clogged up, you mind people dying, you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying and you'd like to say something about it. Once again, as is in everything in America, it's cut off by some poorly educated academic saying it's about slavery. This requires a kind of form of brain surgery to perform it on a society, probably one that's not possible without killing the patient. And it's being done by people who are wearing mittens. So I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this that are rolling their eyes and saying, here we go again, two white guys talking about the lack of institutional racism in America. First of all, what would you like to tell them? So our African American friends who are looking at this, and I've gotten a chance to talk to a bunch of them on Clubhouse recently. Clubhouse is the social app. And I really enjoy it. It's an absolute zoo of an app as far as I can see it. I personally love it because you get to talk to, as somebody who's an introvert and doesn't socialize much, I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life. So it gave me a chance to first of all practice Russian and Ukrainian. So I get the chance to do that. Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine with people who are from that part of the world. And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground where they start screaming, they start crying, they start being calm and collected and thoughtful. As if you walked into a bar with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks, just people that have quote unquote lived experiences, real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases, and you get to listen to them go at it with no, because it's an audio app, you're not allowed to start getting into a physical fist fight. So even though it really sounds like people want it. Sounds like it's happening. Yeah. And so you get to really listen to that feeling. And for example, it allows a white guy like me from another part of the world coming from the former Soviet Union to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans screaming about Joe Rogan using the N word. And I get to really listen. There's very different perspectives on that in the African American community. And it's fascinating to listen. So I don't get access to that by sort of excellent books and articles written and so on. You get that real raw emotion. And I'm just saying there's a few of those folks listening to this with that real raw emotion and they, one argument they say is you, Douglas Murray and you Lex Freeman don't have the right to talk about race and racism in America. It is our struggle. You are from a privileged class of people that don't know what it's like to be a black man or woman in America walking down the street. Can you steel man that case? First of all, fuck that. I think we need to define steel manning. I know what steel manning is. I really resent that form of argumentation. Sure. I really resent it. I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want and no one's going to stop me or try to intimidate me or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color. And I think that if I said to somebody else the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible. If I said, shut up, you have no right to criticize anything that Douglas Murray says because you've not got my skin color. Okay. It's not an exact comparison, but seriously, is that a reasonable form of argument? You haven't been through everything I've been through in my life. Or you can't comment. No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything. We might as well pack up, go home and isolate ourselves. Strong words, but can you try to steel man the case? Not in this particular situation, but there's people that have lived through something that can comment in a very specific way. For example, Holocaust survivors. There is a sense in which maybe a basic sense of civility when a Holocaust survivor is speaking about their experience of the Holocaust, then an intellectual from a very different part of the world that's simply writing about nuanced geopolitics of World War II just should not interrupt the Holocaust survivor. We physically interrupt them if they're telling their story. Good logic and reason that the experience of the Holocaust survivor somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding of the humanity and the injustice of the- First of all, again, we're in even deeper waters now, but in terms of wanting to listen to another person who has experienced something, yes. Yes. But not endlessly. Not endlessly. I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust who didn't experience the Holocaust and have written about it better than people who did. This idea that the lived experience, to use this terrible modern jargon as if there's another type, this idea that the lived experience has to triumph over everything else is not always correct. It can be correct in some circumstances. If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor and somebody who'd never heard about the Holocaust and wanted to shoot out their views on it, yeah, one of those people should be heard more than the other, obviously. If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand and there's somebody else who has never experienced it, then obviously you'd want to hear from the person who has experienced it firsthand if that is the discussion underway. I don't think that it's the case that that is endlessly the case. I'm also highly reluctant to concede that there are groups of people who by dint of their skin color or anything else get to dominate the microphone. Now, of course, we're literally both speaking into microphones at the moment, so there's an irony to this, but let's skate over the irony. What I mean is people saying, you don't have the right to speak. I have the right to take the microphone from you and speak because I know best. Fine. If you know best, we'll argue it out and someone will win long or short term. But the almost aggressive tone in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of. Nobody's experience is completely understandable by another human being. Nobody's. And what many people are asking us to do at the moment, us collectively is to fall for that thing. I think it was Camille Farser who said it first, but I've adopted in recent years, is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life trying to understand me personally, my lived experience, everything about me. You should dedicate your life to trying to do that. Simultaneously, you'll never understand me. This is not an attractive invitation. This is an unwinnable game. So if somebody has a legitimate and important point to make, they should make it and they will win through whatever their characteristics, whatever their race. And by the way, there are plenty of white people who experience racism as well. There are plenty of white people who do and have done and increasingly so, which is one of the things I write about from the war on the West. I mean, I would argue that today in America, the only group who are actually allowed to be consistently, vilely racist against the white people. If you say disgusting things about black people in America in 2022, you will be over. You will be over. If you decide to talk about people's white tears, their white female tears, their white guilt, their white privilege, their white rage, and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms, you'll be just fine. You can be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. You can lecture at Yale University, absolutely fine. And the white people have to suck that up as if that's fine because there was racism in another direction in the past. So white people can have racism as well. Does that mean that I think that I have a right or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse by talking about their feelings of having been the victims of racism? No, not particularly, because what does that get us? It gets us into an endless cycle of competitive victimhood. Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence have experienced historically anything like the violence that was perpetrated against black people in America historically? Obviously not. But, you know, what kind of competition do we want to enter here? And this is very, very important terrain now in America, because there's one other thing I have to throw in there, which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim? How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made? At one point in this latest book, I referred to a very useful bit in Nietzsche and the genealogy of morals, where, as you know, Nietzsche always has to be treated carefully. You know, when people say, I love Nietzsche, you have to say, which bits? What exactly do you love about him? But a lot can be learned from the answer. But there are moments in genealogy of morals that were very useful for this book. One of them was the moment when Nietzsche uses a phrase that I've now stolen for myself, appropriated, you might say, where he refers to people who tear at wounds long since closed and then cry about the pain they feel. Now, how do you know? How do you know whether the pain is real? How do you know? I'm not saying you can never know. But it's hard. So when somebody says, I feel that my life hasn't gone that well, and it's because of something that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago, maybe they do feel that. Maybe they're right to feel that. Maybe they're making it up. Maybe they're using it as a reason for failure in life. Maybe they're using it as a reason to not even try. Maybe they're using it as a reason to smoke weed all day. I don't know. And who does know? How can you work that out? And that's why I come back to this thing of who are we to constantly judge in this society other people who we don't know and attribute motives to them based on racial or other characteristics And as you write in this part, I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche and at the same time canceling Nietzsche in the same set of sentences. But you write in this part about evil. I didn't cancel Nietzsche. I can't cancel Nietzsche. I was saying treat him carefully. Treat him carefully. Fair enough. But you can judge a man's character by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes. Fair enough. I think when you meet people who do man and Superman a bit too much. Now you're pulling in even deeper water referencing Hitler here. Okay. So you write in this part of the book about evil. Quote, what is it that drives evil? Many things without doubt, but one of them is identified by several of the great philosophers is resentment. That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers for people who want to destroy. Colon blaming someone else for having something you believe you deserve more. And you're saying this kind of resentment, we don't know as it surfaces whether it's genuine or if it's used to sort of play games of power to evil ends. Can you speak to this? Because it's such an fascinating idea that one of the biggest drivers of evil in the world is resentment. Because if you look at, boy, if you look at human history, if you look at Hitler, so much of the propaganda, so much of the narrative was about resentment. So that surface level or is that deep? The resentment that drives evil? It can be any of the above. Let's first of all preface it. Everybody has resentment. I use the term resentment, which is thought very similar to resentment. Let's stick with resentment. So we don't sound too pretentious. The let me give you a quick example of somebody in our own day who has a form of resentment, Vladimir Putin. Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace? Yes. You remember the stuff about Putin as a young KGB officer in Germany? And the stuff about Putin, his first wife's resentment of one of his KGB colleagues who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger than the Putin's apartment. Yeah. It's very interesting. And by the way, I'm not saying that, you know, Vladimir Putin became the man he has become and invaded Ukraine because he didn't have an apartment he liked in Berlin or Munich wherever he was. It's a distinct possibility. My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives and we all feel it in our lives and it's something that has to be struggled against. Resentment is in political terms can be a deadly, I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing to draw upon. I mean, you mentioned Hitler. Obviously, one of the things that Hitler played on was resentment, obviously. Almost every revolution does. I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well. Not without cause. It was a good reason to feel that Versailles was not listening to Paris in the 1780s and to feel resentment for Marie Antoinette in her palace within the palace, ignoring the bread shortages in Paris. So resentment is a very understandable thing and sometimes it's justifiable and it's also deadly to the person as it is to the society. It's an incredibly deep sentiment. Somebody else has got something that you should have. And the problem about it is that it has the potential to be endless. You can do it your whole life. And one of the ways I've sort of found myself explaining this to people is to say it's also important to recognize that resentment is something that can cross absolutely every boundary. So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries, obviously, it goes without saying. More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries and socioeconomic boundaries. And if I was to sort of simplify this thought, I would say, I guess that you and I and everybody watching knows or has known somebody in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms and is a generous person, a kindly person, a giving person, a happy person, even a cheerful person. And I think we probably have also, or many of us would have met people who seem to have everything and who are filled with resentment, filled with resentment. Somebody else has held them back from something, their sister once did something, she got this and I should have got that and on and on and on. It's a human trait. And one of the things that suggests to me is that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this. This is something which we can do something about, not limitlessly. But for instance, I mean, there are very good reasons that some people in their lives might feel resentment. Let's say you're involved in a car crash and a friend fell asleep at the wheel and that's why you are spending the rest of your life in a wheelchair. That's a pertinent example of this in American politics at the moment. You would be justified in feeling resentment. And at some point you have to make a decision, which is, am I going to be that person or a different person? But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level and the societal level is destructive to the mind. Even when you're quote unquote justified. It rots you. It rots you because the best you can do is to eke out your days unfulfilled. So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude. Yes. Gratitude is the antidote to evil in a sense. Gratitude is the individual level and the societal level. Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment. I quote in The War on the West, when I read it the first time a few years ago, I was absolutely floored by the Brothers Karamazov. Not everything in it, by the way, but I have some very big structural criticisms of the novel. Now you're just sweet talking to me because I'm a Dostoevsky fan, but I appreciate this. Oh, okay. Well, we could get into what I see as big structural flaws in the Brothers Karamazov. Anyway, now I'm offended and triggered. Yeah, no, I mean, this is coming out of Macbeth and saying, I didn't think it was much good. Yeah, there's structural flaws. Yeah, I thought the ending stank. Yeah. The middle wasn't very good. When I read that novel, I was floored by a couple of things. One is, of course, at the moment where we realize the devil appears. The moment that Ivan says to his brother, you know he visits me, and he realized that he's talking about the devil, the whole novel goes into this totally different space. Anyway, it's even more than you've already realized the novel's about. And then when the conversation occurs between Ivan and the devil, I think he describes him as dressed in the French style of the early part of the 19th century. It's strange that the devil would be dressed like that. And if you remember, he's sort of cross-legged and rather a Bane figure. The devil mentions in passing to Ivan that he says, I don't know why gratitude is not an instinct that's been given to me. Yeah, you're not allowed. This is not, given the role of being the devil, this is not one of the things. It's just not one of the things. And of course, only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could, I mean, a lesser genius would have made a whole novel out of that insight. Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away because there's such an abundance of riches that he still has to get through, structural problems aside. The passive aggressive, the microaggression in this conversation is palpable. Little knife fight. But the reason I mention this is because, of course, when I saw this, this is such a brilliant insight by Dostoevsky because why would gratitude not be a sentiment that the devil was capable of? The answer is, of course, that if the devil was capable of gratitude, he wouldn't be the devil. He'd be somebody else. He has to be incapable of gratitude. Do you think for Dostoevsky that was as strong of an insight as it is for you? Because I think that's a really powerful idea that with gratitude, you don't get the resentment that rots you from the core. Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things that he saw in us. And the way I put it is that, I mean, I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction, which is one of the things I'd like us to call the era that's now ending. The era of deconstruction was the era that started, let's say, from the 60s onwards and was originally an academic game that then spilled out into the wider culture, which was, let's take everything apart. Let's pull it all apart. There are lots of problems with it. One is it's quite boring. You don't get an awful lot from it. You also have the problem of what children find when they try to do this with bicycles, which is they can take it apart quite easily, but they can't put it back together. And the era of taking things apart as a game is one we've lived through and it's been highly destructive. But you can do it for quite a long time. I'm going to look at this society and I'm going to take it apart by showing systemic problems. At the end of that, what have you got? What have you done? What have you achieved? We need to interrogate this. Okay, interrogate. By all means, ask questions, but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this. I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart. And again, at the end of it, what have you got? Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music or an idea or a society, fine. Just question, endlessly question. Yes, interrogate. Assumes it's all criminal in a cell and it's guilty and therefore it must be taken apart. And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West. And that's resentment. That's one byproduct of resentment. You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart. Is a little bit of resentment good? So you have, you know that I love Tom Waits and he has a song where a little drop of, I like my time with a little drop of poison. Is it good to do that? Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink? It depends what the poison is and it depends if you know not to have another drink. It might be the case you find out as some alcoholics too that one was too many and 10 is not enough. So there's a natural, in this case, this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope. It becomes an addiction, becomes a drug and you just can't stop. You'd have to wean yourself off it and try to start creating again. You'd have to start trying to put things together again. Something I think might be in the throes of starting as it happens. Well speaking of taking things apart and not putting them together again, the idea of critical race theory. Can you to me explain, so I'm an engineer and have not been actually paying attention much unfortunately to these things. None of the people in your field were until it comes along and smacks you in the face. I've had that line of thinking from MIT. I said well surely whatever you folks are busy about yelling at each other for is a thing at Harvard and Yale. It's not going to be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. People in the STEM subjects thought it's not coming for us. It can't come to us and bang. Well it hasn't quite been a bang. Engineering is more safe than others. So let's draw a line now between engineering and science. I think engineering is I'm sitting in a castle in the tallest tower with my pinky out drinking my martini saying surely the peasants below with their biology and their humanities will figure it all out. No, I'm just kidding. There's no pinky out. I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants. Okay, where is this metaphor has gone too far? Can you explain to this engineer what critical race theory is? Is it a term that's definable? Is there a tradition? Is there a history? What is good about it? What is bad about it? It is a tradition. It is a history. It's a school of thought. It started in the law roughly in the 1970s in some of the American Academy. It spilled out. It always aimed to be an activist philosophy. People deny that now, but as I cite in the war on the west, the foundational texts say as much. This is an activist academic study. We're not just looking at the law. We seek to change the law. And it's built out into all of the other disciplines. I think there's a reason for that, by the way, which is it happened at the time that the humanities and others in America were increasingly weak and didn't know what to do and they needed more games to play or new games to play. The psychologists got bored. Yeah. I mean, well, they needed tenure and they needed something to do. And I mean, it's not an original observation. Plenty of people have made this, but I mean, Neil Ferguson said this some time ago, for instance, that in the last 50 years in American academia, certainly in humanities departments, when somebody dies out who's a great scholar in something, that's just not replaced by somebody of equal stature. They were placed by somebody who does theory or critical race theory. They were placed by somebody who does the modern games. Somebody dies out who's a great historian of say, I don't know, it's the ones on my mind, Russian history or Russian literature, and they're not replaced by a similar scholar. In his observation and in yours, is this a recent development? It's happened in the last few decades for sure, and it's sped up. Is it because we've gotten to the bottom of some of the biggest questions of history? No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions. Because it's more fun to, big questions aren't as fun? No, partly it's, no, I should stress it, partly this is in the weeks, but partly it's a result of the hyper specialization in academia. You know, if you said you'd like to write your dissertation on Hobbes, if you wanted to, if you, something central to Kant's thought or Hegel or something, I mean, that's not popular. What's popular is to take somebody way down the line from that because there's a feeling that that's all been done. So you take something way, way, way down the line from that, that's much less important, and then you sort of play with that. And I think most people, anyone who's watching who's been in a philosophy department or anything else in recent years will know that tendency. By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this. I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life when he would occasionally, he didn't get tenure at universities, but he would occasionally be flown in even by his enemies to teach courses in various universities in basics of philosophy because there was no one in the department able to do it. Like he would, he would, he would go in and teach for a semester, you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others, because there was no one to do it because they were all playing with the things way, way, way down the road from this. So that had already happened and people were searching for new games to play and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in, partly in the way that all of this that's now known as anti-racism does, which is in a sort of bullying tone of saying, if you don't follow this, it's the same way that all the things that are called studies, I think everything called studies in the humanities should be shut down. Because of the activist element. It's an, they're all activists, gay studies and queer studies. Nothing good has ever come from it. Nothing good. To push back, is it, is it obvious that activism is a sign of a flaw in a discipline? So isn't it- It's a sign of the death of the discipline. It's a sign that discipline is over. But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline to enact change, positive change in the world? Or is that to, is that, that's for politicians to do with the findings of science, not- Why create an ideology and then set out to find disciplines that are weakly put together to try to back up your political ideology? So ideology should not be part of, of, of science or of- No, I mean, why would you, I mean, anyone could do it. You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing about something and only do things that prove your right wing ideas, be fantastically anti-academic, fantastically anti-science. It's an absurd way to mix up activism and, and, and, and academia. And it's absolutely right. And Critical Race Theory is one of the ones that completely polluted the academy. Yeah. And there's been dark moments throughout history, both for, during World War II with both communism and Naziism, fascism, that infiltrated science and then corrupted it. Yes. I mean, for instance, also let's face it, in science, as in everything else, there are dark, difficult things. It's much better we know about them, face up to them and try to find a way socially to deal with them than that you leave them in the hands of some activist who wants to do stuff with them. Some of my best friends are activists, I'm just kidding. Okay. None of my best friends are activists. That's how it should be. Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends, but okay. Now I'm trying to gain some pity points. Okay. So to return- You have your clubhouse friends screaming away like deranged maniacs. Now I'm anti-clubhouse by the way, because the only time I heard it was that Brett Weinstein one when he did that. I don't know if you heard that early in clubhouse. I was invited to clubhouse by various people who said, oh, this is a really great, civilized way to hang out and talk with interesting people. I downloaded the app and I got on one night and because Brett Weinstein said, I'm doing this conversation and I listened and it was the maddest damn discussion I've ever heard. Was it something about biology? Something about, was it COVID times? At some point Brett said, I'm an evolutionary biologist and somebody else started saying, you're a eugenicist. And he said, no, I'm an evolutionary biologist. That's the same thing. And it just went on like that. And Brett desperately tried to explain that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist and he lost the clubhouse room. They thought that was the same thing. It horribly reminded me of a time some years ago in a British newspaper, realizing that the only thing you can unite people on in sexual ethics is revulsion against pedophilia. Ran an anti-pedo campaign and shortly after pediatrician's offices were torched in North of England by a mob who hadn't read the whole sign. Yeah. Well, to me, like I said, a little bit of poison is good for the town. So, anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you with flattering you with our people on clubhouse. I have many, I have multiples of friends. Yes. We didn't get to some of the ideas of critical race theory. What exactly is it? I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely. Yeah. It's an attempt to look at everything among other things through the lens of race and to add race into things where it may not be as a way of adding, I'm trying to give the most generous estimation, to add race in as a conversation in a place where it may not have been in the conversation. That means history too? The history of racism? Oh, sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All history. And to look at it through these particular lenses. I mean, there's a certain, like all these things, there's a certain logic in it. Like with feminist studies or something, I mean, is there a utility in looking back through undoubtedly male dominated histories and asking where the more silent female voice was? Yes. Very interesting. Not endlessly interesting and can't be put exactly on the same par as, but it has a utility. It's that endlessly sorry to interrupt that endlessly part that seems to get us into trouble a lot. Well, because of this thing of where do you stop? And that's, that's, that's always a, I looked at, talked about this in my last book in the manners of crowds. It's one of the big conundrums in activist movements and particularly in activist academia. Where would you stop? It's not clear because you've got a job in it. You've got a pension in it. You've got your only esteem in society is in keeping this gig going. What I mean is, is there any likelihood? Have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't it? That, you know, the end of every conference, the only thing everyone agrees on is that we must have another conference like this one. So one thing they always agree on. This conference is so great. We must have another one. Well, that's a criticism you could apply to a lot of disciplines. Of course civil engineering bridge building. It's at a certain point. Do we need any more bridges? Can we just fly everywhere? So at the very least you need to keep the bridges up. Sure. And they would, a critical race theory folks would probably make the same argument that the very least we need to keep the racism out. We have to make sure we don't descend into the racism. It assumes all the time that we are living on the cusp of the return of the KKK. Right. Which is totally wrong. I mean, it's a massive. You say that now until the KKK armies march in. We don't always, we can't always predict the future. We can't always predict the future and you can always say you should be careful, but you've also got to be careful of people who've got their timing like totally, totally wrong or their estimation of the society they're in. You mean like most of society before in the 1930s when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong. Sure they did. And so, most people. So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there. Well, beware of the man with the mustache. Yes. If only it was that easy. Um, it's not always about facial hair. I always say that. I mean, what, what? Well, it very often is these two clean shaven chaps say one of the problems with everybody knowing a little bit about Nazism is that they think that they know where evil comes from and that it comes from like a German with a small mustache, getting people to goose step for instance. And that's not correct. A much better understanding of it is it can come from all number of directions and keep your antennae as good as you can. But once you end up in this society, which I would argue certainly parts of America in where you're always in 1938, that's not healthy for a society either. Where, where people are so primed and think they're so well trained because they spent a term in school learning about the second world war and the Holocaust think they're so well trained in Hitler spotting that they can do it all the time. Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies like dog whistle. You know, as I always say, if you hear the whistle, you're the dog. But people say that's a dog whistle as if they're highly trained anti-Nazis. I mean, you know, there should be some humility in it. We should, we should be careful. We should be wary for sure. And we should also be slightly humble in our inability to, to spot everything. If not significantly humble. Right. So if we can, there's something funny, if not dark about the, the activity of Hitler spotting, if I just may take an aside, but so critical race theory, how much racism, what is racism? How much of it is in our world today? If we were thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting, how, and trying to steel man the case of if not critical race theory, but people who, who look for racism in our world, how much would you say? Well it's a good thing to try to define. I would say that racism is the, the belief that other people are inferior to you. You could say you could see a form of it where you thought people were superior to you. That could also happen, but more commonly is you see a group of people as being inferior to you simply by dint of the fact that they have a different racial background. And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism. As I say, I mean, there are types of racism, mainly antisemitism actually, perhaps it's the only one which weirdly relies on, on a hatred of people who a certain type of person thinks thinks are better than them. And that's a particular peculiarity, one of the peculiarities of antisemitism. Well, antisemitism somehow does both, right? Yes. Well, one of the eternal fascinating things about antisemitism is it can do, it does everything at the same time. It's like a quantum racism. Yes. Both superior and inferior. Do you know Vasily Grosvenor's Life and Fate? So in the middle of Life and Fate, which a Persian friend of mine who said was one of only two great novels of the 20th century, she was very harsh, literally critic. What was the other one? Oh, The Leopard, obviously. The Leopard? The Leopard of Giuseppe de Lampedusa. Yeah. Okay. She's definitely right on that one. Life and Fate is- I'm learning so much today. Yes, Life and Fate. Life and Fate is an extraordinary book, mainly about- well, you know Grosvenor was a, obviously Jewish himself, but he saw almost everything that he could have done in the Second World War. He saw Stalingrad, a journalist, and he wrote firsthand accounts of Stalingrad. He was also the first journalist into Treblinka. And his account, which you can read in one of the collections of his journalism, his account of walking into Treblinka is just one of the most devastating, haunting pieces of journalism or prose you can read. Anyhow, I mentioned him because Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate, which is about a 900 page novel, in the middle of it, which is about the dark axis around Stalingrad, the way at one point he amazingly sort of goes into the minds of both Hitler and Stalin. He says Stalin in his study feels his counterpart in Berlin, and he says he feels very close to him at this moment. Wow. Around Stalingrad, like leading up to the battle. After Stalingrad, when the Germans are lost, he says he feels the closeness of Hitler. But Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate, slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century, suddenly dedicates a chapter to antisemitism. And I've seen antisemitism is something I've always been very interested in, because I've always had an instinctive utter revulsion of it. And also partly because of having seen bits of it in the Middle East and elsewhere. But I mentioned this because Grosvenor, in the middle of Life and Fate, takes time out and does this three page description of antisemitism. And it's extraordinary. The only thing I can think of that's equally good is Gregor von Retsori, who wrote a luridly titled but brilliant set of novellas called Confessions of an Antisemite about pre-First World War antisemitism in Eastern and Central Europe. Grosvenor says, in the middle of Life and Fate, that one of the extraordinary things about antisemitism is that it does everything at the same time. Those Jews get condemned in one place for being rich and in another for being poor, condemned in one place for assimilating in another for not assimilating, for assimilating too much and assimilating too little, for being too successful for not being successful enough. I think it's the only racism that includes within it a detestation for the real antisemite, a detestation of people that the person may perceive to be better than them, correctly or otherwise. By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read this one of two greatest novels of the 20th century, Life and Fate, and just to read off of Wikipedia, I see Grosvenor, the Ukrainian Jew became a correspondent for the Soviet military paper, Krasnaya Zvezda, having volunteered and been rejected for military service. He spent a thousand days in the front lines, roughly three of the four years of the conflict between the Germans and Soviets. And the main themes covered in, how does it go, Life and Fate, I keep thinking, is a theme on Jewish identity and the Holocaust, Grossman's idea of humanity and the human goodness, Stalin's distortion of reality and values, and science, like goes on in reality of war. It's interesting. I need to definitely read it. I think you'll really get a lot from it. One of the other things, sorry, I'm rippling it, but one of the other things he does is that he has this extraordinary ability to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict and then zoom in. It's rather like the camera work they use in things like Lord of the Rings, where he zooms down and then gets one person in the midst of all this and you get on that. Or puts you in the study too. So I personally have read and reread the William Shire's The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, who was another journalist who was there, but he does not do it. Interestingly enough, given such a large novel, kind of the definitive work on, the definitive original work that goes to Source Materials on Hitler, he doesn't touch antisemitism really. Big thing to miss out. Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively as he does for most of the work that this was the fact of life. There's a lot of cruelty throughout, but he doesn't get to- Well, one of the things is of course he lost the war because of antisemitism. I mean, that's one kind of important way to view it. Andrew Roberts, another historian, said is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war because they were Nazis. It sounds almost too neat, but it's worth remembering that at the end of the war, when the Germans need to be transporting troops and they need to be transporting very basic supplies, Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains to transport the Jews right up to the end. Well, that's certainly a dark possibility. You know, anyhow, but to go back to racism in general, racism in general, apart from antisemitism, relies on the perception that another group of people, a racial group, other than your own are inferior to you. That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism. And of course, it's one of the stupidest things that our species is capable of. I mean, one of the stupidest that you can look at a person and guess them in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color. I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is, as well as being an evil one. But the, the, I would say that one of the, I think it's a dangerous thing in our era that there are bits of it coming back. That's why I say we do need sort of, we need our antennae working. We just don't need them to be overactive or underactive, you know. Now, the book is war in the West, but speaking of racism, racism towards different groups based on their skin color, you've said that there's a war on white people in the West. Would you say that's the case? Would you say that there is significant racism towards white people in the United States? I'd say that the white people in the United States are the only people who are told that they have hereditary sin. And that's a big one, just to start with. Based strictly on the color of the skin. Based on their skin color. I mean, I would find it so repugnant if, and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this, I would feel it so repugnant if there were any school of thought in America today that had any grasp on the public attention that said that black people were born into evil because of something their ancestors had done. Like they had the mark of Cain upon them. I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way to try to demoralize a group of people and to tell them that the things they would be able to achieve in their lives are much lessened because they should spend significant portions of their lives trying to atone for something they didn't do. Is there a difference? And the point, the obvious point left unsaid, but let's say it, nobody in the public square says that, and they're the maniacs of the far fringes, but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that, or I think even think that about any group of people other than white people. And does this mean that white people are more disadvantaged than black people? No. And again, let's not make this a competition, but let's not get into, I just desperately urge people not to get into the idea of hereditary sin according to racial background. Is there something to be said about the feature aspect to sort of play devil's advocate about the asymmetry of sort of accusations towards the majority? So because white, it's much easier to attack a majority. It is much easier, but is there something to be said about that being a useful function of society that you always attack? That the minority has disproportionate power to attack the majority so that you can always keep the majority in check? Well, it's a dangerous game to play, isn't it? I think that's a good summary of entirety of human civilization. Well, yeah, everything is dangerous. But it's a very dangerous game to play that. I wrote about this a bit in the matters of crowds when I was saying to like gay rights people, the ones that still exist, the ones who don't have homes to go to, who want to beat up on straight people in a way, or want to make straight people feel like they're kind of unremarkable, uncool, you know, boring straights. So boring. So not like the magical pixie fairy dust gays. That's a bad idea to push that one. That's a bad idea. And some gays push that. Highly unwise, given the fact that about two to three percent of the population are actually gay, although now there's like an additional 20 percent who think they're like two spirit or something and all that bullshit, but they're just attention seekers. So let's not spend too much time on that. But equally, as I said, I said, the matters of crowds with the feminist movement, very unwise for half of the species to say that the other half of the species isn't needed. And there were always third and fourth wave feminists willing to make that nuts argument. Not first wave feminists. You didn't hear it in first wave feminists. You didn't hear it. Suffragettes tended not to say, we'd like the vote and men are scum. It would have been hard to have won everyone over to their side, not least the men they needed to win over to their side. But you do get third and fourth wave feminists who say like, you know, do we need men or men are all X? Again, it's a bad idea. It's a bad idea tactically. What if men, Richard Wrangham, somebody from Harvard, describes that men are the originators of violence, physical violence in society. And he argues that actually the world would be better off. No, just a very cold calculus. If you get rid of men, there would be a lot less violence in society is his claim. But who says you need to get rid of violence in society? Well that's, but shouldn't that at least be a discussion? Have a debate on a panel discussion, violence, pros and cons. Well that's the sort of thing, if I can say so, the Sunday WeekHouse academic decides to do because he thinks that his area of Boston would be nicer or whatever. He might decide it's useful if he was living in Kiev today to have violent men. I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now, I'd need some violent men around here. But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men, is the argument. At least there's some level of threat that you ought to exude that puts people off. If I was in, I'm very glad that the men and women of Ukraine are capable of, and more than capable of fighting for their country and for their neighbors and their families and much more. But it's better that there was violence ready to unleash when violence was unleashed upon them than that the whole society had been told that they should identify as non-binary. But at least it's a conversation to have, isn't there aspect to the feminist movement that is correct in challenging the... Some forms of violence, domestic violence for instance, although women are capable of that as well. I'm learning about this. We're all learning about this at the moment. I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down in this beautiful mess that is human relations. But just to finish that thought, it's very unwise for women to war against men, as it would be for men to war against women. It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population. And in America, Britain, and other Western countries, white people are still a majority. And so why would you tell the majority that they're evil by dint of their skin color and think that that would be a good way to keep them in check? I'm not guilty of anything because of my skin color. I'm not guilty of anything. My ancestors didn't do anything wrong. And even if they had, why would I be held responsible for it? So to go back to Nietzsche, is there some aspect to where, if we try to explain the forces of play here, is it the will to power playing itself out from individual human nature and from group behavior nature? Is there some elements to this, which is the game we play as human beings is always when we have less power, we try to find ways to gain more power. That's certainly one. The desire to grab is, let me see if I can find a quote for you on that. The desire to grab that which we think we're owed and to do it often in the guise of justice. I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age and one of the very great bogus terms of our age. People forever talk about their search for justice. It's amazing how violent they can often be in their search for justice and how many rules they're willing to break so long as they can say they're after justice and how many norms they can trample so long as they can say it's in the name of justice. You can burn down buildings in the name of justice. Well, the majority groups throughout history, including those with white skin color, have done the same in the name of justice. We come up with all kinds of sexy terms in our propaganda machines to sell whatever atrocities we'd like to commit. One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked, and I quoted in this- Careful, I'm judging you harshly. Yeah, of course. Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment is they'll achieve their ultimate form of revenge, which is to turn happy people into unhappy people like themselves, to shove their misery in the faces of the happy so that in due course the happy, and this is quoting Nietzsche, start to be ashamed of their happiness and perhaps say to one another, it's a disgrace to be happy. There is too much misery. This is something to be averted for the sick says Nietzsche must not make the healthy sick too or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick. Well, I think there again, there's a lot of that going on. How could I be happy when there is unhappiness in the world? Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy? I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well. Sure. Notes from Underground. Okay. This has been very Russian, Russian focused. I'm very pleased with the number of times that Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in. This is very- I wasn't doing this as a sort of- Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats and good to know they're still relevant. Do you speak Russian by the way at all? Which I did. I'm told it's a 10 year language basically to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it. Well, there's the language and then there's the personality behind the language and the personality I feel like you already have. So you just need to know the surface details. Okay. In fact, the silence to be silent in the Russian language is something that's already important. Oh, if we had a moment, I'd tell you my story about Stalin's birthplace. Should I tell you that? No. I once went to Gori where Stalin was born. Have you been? No. I was there just after the Georgia war. I went to the no man's land in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. And I said, I really got to go to Gori also here because the shell had landed in Gori rather weirdly from the Russian side and Gori is where Stalin was born. And of course Gori is in Georgia. And anyhow, the Museum of Stalin's birthplace, they've been trying to change for some years because it had been unadulteratedly pro-Stalin for years. And the Georgian authorities, this is in the Shakishvili's time, were trying to make it into a Museum of Stalinism. And it was really tough. The only place I've seen which is similar is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed. That also is like, they're not quite sure what to do. They don't want to say he's a bad guy because they think that people won't come. Anyhow, Stalin's house in Gori had changed from the Museum of Stalin to the Museum of Stalinism. There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil who had clearly been doing the tour for like 50 years. And it just pointed all the facts. She did that classic thing I've also saw it once in North Korea where they sort of, that sort of communist thing where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high by 13 feet deep. It gives you lots of facts. I don't care. Why does it matter? It will give you facts. This is Stalin's suitcase. It is 13 inches wide by, you know, there isn't. Anyhow, and this woman did all of this and it was all just wildly pro, well, not pro-Stalin, just explaining the Stalin's life. It was just a great local boy done good. They didn't mention the fact he killed more Georgians per capita than anyone else. Local boy done good. And we get to the end and before being taken to the gift shop where they sell red wine with Stalin's face on it and among other things, and a lighter with Stalin on it, they took you to a little room under the stairs and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time. Now gift shop. And she says, no, no, cause I took the woman aside at the end. I just go, what she'd said is to other journalists and I took her aside and I said, what do you think about communist Stalin? And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this during communist times. He said it's not my place to judge, you know, sort of thing. We have an interesting comment in itself. I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone and all that sort of thing. It's not my place to judge or to give my views and those sort of things. And eventually I said, well, what do you feel about it? And she said, it was like a hurricane. It happened. It's interesting because if I may mention clubhouse once again, I got an chance to talk to a few people from Mongolia. There's a woman from Mongolia and they talked about the fact that they deeply admire Stalin love. She sounded, if I may, hopefully that's not crossing line. I think I'm representing her correctly in saying she admired him almost like, um, like loved them like the people, the way people love like, um, like, like Jesus, like a holy figure. Well, isn't that still the case in large parts of Russia? Yeah. I mean, keep some Stalin keeps on winning greatest Russian of all time. And that's perhaps maybe there's a dip, but if we were to think about the long arc of history, perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up as there's something about human memory that it just, you forget the details of the atrocities of the past. I mean, think of the number of people we talk about as historical heroes, Napoleon. I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero, but the French, now you're, you did the thing that the Stasovsky now again, tricky ground, but like the, the, the French are enormous in my Napoleon and they had many animal assets. He was also unbelievable brute and killed many people unnecessarily. And there are lots of figures from history that we sort of cover that over with. Yeah. Yeah. Can we mention Churchill briefly? Because he is one of the, um, you can make a case for him being one of the great representatives or great figures historically of the Western civilization. And then there's a lot of people, uh, from not a lot. I know I have like three friends and one of them happens to be from London and they say that he's a, a, um, not a good person. Why? So listen, this friend would not discuss, I just, this is an opinion poll of the three friends, but I do know that there's quite a bit, you know, there's a back cash going on at the moment at the moment. And in general, there's a spirit like reflecting on, on the darker sides of some of these historical figures like challenging history through it's, it's not just critical race theory. It's, it's, it's challenging history through, well, uh, are the people we think of as heroes, what are their flaws and are they villains that are convenient? Um, sort of, uh, were there at the right time to accidentally do the right thing. Exactly. Well, I hope this isn't the representative fair estimation of your friend in London's views. No, she's going to be quite mad at this, but I didn't say the name, so it could be any friends. It could be Canada. Well, see, I, uh, I, given that away, but that's with, of course I would not, um, I made that up completely. It's, it's all just like my girlfriend in Canada. She's completely a figment of my imagination. Still us Winston Churchill, uh, is somebody, I mean, just looking at reading the rise and fall of the third rike is an incredible figure that, um, that to me, so much of world war two is marked leading up to the war is marked by stunning amounts of cowardice by political leaders and it's fascinating to watch here. This person clearly with the drinking and a smoking problem was, I don't understand why that's a negative. No, I didn't say you see it. You throw it in as if it is. No, well, it's, it's called humor. I'll explain it to you one day what that means, but he stood up, he, he stood up to what we now see as evil when at the time it was not so obvious to see, um, you know, so that's, that's just a fascinating figure of Western civilization. I'd love to get your comments. The real criticisms, I mean, I was making a drinking, the real criticisms of, of, of Churchill are quite easy to sum up. And I do so in the war in the West. I say these are the things that they now use against him. Uh, didn't do enough to avert the Bengal famine in 1943. And since that's, that's been shot down by numerous historians, including Indian historians, uh, in the middle of the war, in the middle of a world war, Churchill did what he could to get grain supplies diverted, um, from Australia to, to, to, to Bengal. Uh, um, the famine was appalling. It was caused by a typhoon. It was not caused by Winston Churchill. Um, and the idea that some basically Indian nationalist historians have pumped out in recent years and just anti-Churchill figures that he actually wanted Indians to die is, um, it's just total calumny. And when people claim, some people claim that, I mean, there was a few very ignorant scholars and nevertheless with some credentials who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population to basically be genocided. And it's complete nonsense, not least by the fact that during the period, which in question Indian population boomed. Um, so that's one of the main ones. Another one is that he had, um, some views that we now had regarded as racist. He definitely regarded races as being of different characters, um, and that there were superior races and the, the, as it were, the white European was a superior culture. Um, uh, he was born in Victorian England. So he had some Victorian attitudes. Um, these are things in the negative side of the ledger. And as with all history, you should have a negative and a positive side of the ledger. Positive side of the ledger includes, he almost certainly did more than any one human being to save the world from Nazism. So that should count as something. And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill in this regard is to stress that if you get, I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all. I don't think the revisionism of recent years about Churchill or the founding fathers of America or anyone else is anything I want to stop. I find it interesting. I find interesting, not least cause it's so sloppy on occasions, but I find it interesting and it's important and we should be able to see people in the round, but that includes recognizing the positive side of the ledger. And if you can't recognize that side, you're doing something else. You're doing something else. It's not history. It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind. And I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers. There are some people, for instance, certainly since the nineties who have pushed the Sally Hemings Thomas Jefferson story to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute. As a result, you know, we see Jefferson's statue being removed from the council chamber in the city we're sitting in last November by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson no longer represents our values. If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson and that he had flaws, I mean, that's not a grownup debate. And weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time, but let me sort of throw a curveball at you then. What about recognizing the positive and the negative of a fellow with nice facial hair called Karl Marx? Sure. Sure. I mean, I have a section in the war on the West, as you know, where I go for Karl Marx with some glee. So he seems to have gotten some popularity in the West recently. Not just recently. Yeah. I mean, he's had a resurgence recently. Yes, resurgence. Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong, people reach for other options. And when, for instance, it's very hard for people to accumulate capital, it's not obvious that they're going to become capitalists. And so one thing that happens is people say, let's look at the Marxism thing again, see if that's a viable go. My argument would simply be point me to one place that's worked. Well, the argument from the Marxists or the Marxian economists is that we've only really tried it once the Soviets tried it. And then if there's a few people that kind of tried the Soviet thing. Cuba tried it? So they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet. Sure, they tried it. Yes, they've tried it. They tried it in Venezuela. Yes, yes, yes. So let's just quickly say, how did all these experiments go? They did not, well, they failed in fascinating ways. They did, but they failed. Yes, they failed. And we should stress, so grossly failed, so grossly failed that they threw millions and millions of people into completely thwarted lives that were much shorter than they should have been. Yeah. So the lesson to learn there that you can learn several lessons. One is that anything that smells like Marxism is going to lead to a lot of problems. Now another lesson could be, well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had? He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism. So is it possible to do better than capitalism? And that's, if you take that spirit, you start to wonder, that might actually become relevant in, I don't know, 20, 30, 50 years when the machines start doing more and more of the labor, all those kinds of things. You start to ask questions. We finally might get to Marx's dream of what the average day would look like. Yes. Well, there's going to be an awful lot of literary criticism then. If you remember, that's what Marx said that we would be doing in the evenings, the laborer in the evening. Well, he didn't know Twitter was a thing or Netflix. So he would change. Are there things we could learn from Marx? Plausibly, possibly. I can't think of anything myself offhand. But to have a critique of capitalism isn't by any means a bad thing in the society. I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism that showed how you improve capitalism. A critique of free market that showed how people could get better access to the free market. How you could ensure, for instance, that young people get onto the property ladder, things like that. Those are constructive things. The people who say we must have Marxism, I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking about because that never leads to any of those things. Haven't led in the past. It's never led in the past. And at some point, you've got to try to work out how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy before you realize that every attempt always leads to the same thing. We could pretend that fascism has never been properly tried and that it was unfortunate what happened in Nazi Germany. But that wasn't real fascism. And in Mussolini's fascism, it didn't go all that well, but it was a bit better. And maybe we could try a bit more Franco-fascism. Nobody would have any time for this crap, nor should they. The people who try that are reviled, and quite rightly. So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing? And it's a great mystery to me the way that people do tolerate it. Always, always in this stupid way of saying, we haven't done it yet. If you keep trying the same recipe, and every time it comes out as shit, it's that the recipe is shit. Well, sort of, I'm trying to practice here by playing devil's advocate, practice the same idea that you mentioned, which is when you say the word Marxism, should you throw out everything, or should you ask a question, is there good ideas here? And the same, it's the good, it's weighing the good and the bad, and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully. Sure. Do you know the famous George Orwell comment in an argument with a Stalinist? Do you know? No. That's one of my favorite quotes. George Orwell in the early 40s gets into an argument with a Stalinist, who's obviously a Marxist. And this is after the Show Trials, 37. This is when it's very clear what Marxism in the Russian form is. And Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist, and it goes on and on. And eventually Orwell says, well, what about the Show Trials, and what about what's happened in Ukraine, and the famines, and much more, and the purges, and the purges, and the purges. And eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell what Orwell knows he's going to say all along, which is he says, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs. And Orwell says, where's the omelet? Oh, yeah, that's a good, that's a really good. Look at this by this stage, okay? How many- Where's my damn omelet? How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles have the Marxists created by now in country after country? Always next time they're going to produce the great omelet. But they never have, and they never will, because the whole thing is rotten from the start. But let me just also say one thing about, because of course Marx isn't as nice as he sounds. And that's one of the things that I try to highlight in the book is, if we're going to do this reductive thing of people in history and saying, well, they had views that were of their time, and we must therefore condemn them for them. Say, fine, let's do the same thing with Marx. And there are things I quote in this book from Marx's letters, not least the letters to Engels. And indeed in his published writings, he was writing for the American press in the eight and fifties, the way he has horrible views on slavery and colonialism and much more. But the main thing is, I mean, the horrible things he says about black people and the constant use of the N-word. In fact, when I was doing the audio book for the Wall of the West, I had to decide, will I read out the quotes from Marx or not? If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled because people would have just said, you've been using the N-word so much in this passage. And I slightly thought of doing it so that I could say I was only quoting Marx to try to hit the point home. In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to, but Marx's letters are disgusting on these terms. Since I highlighted this in this book and some of the media picked it up and have popularized this thing I'm trying to put into the system, which is if you're going to accuse Churchill of racism, if you're going to accuse Jefferson of racism, Washington of racism and so on, what about Marx? The two things that Marxists have said since this came out has been, first of all, why are you saying this about Marx? He was a man of his time, like everyone else. And the second thing they say is we don't go to Marx for his horrible, abhorrent views on race. They're talking about mixed race people as gorillas and so on. We don't go to him for that. We go to him for his economic theories. I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson for his views on slaves. We don't go to Churchill for the precise language he used that points in the 1910s about Indians. Or his health advice. Or his health advice. Actually, I do get him for that. But I explained so much. But let's have some standards on this. And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact that the people don't do this with Marx. Because I think what some people are trying to do, and this may sound conspiratorial, but I really don't think it is. I think that some people are deliberately trying to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past in order to say there's nothing good, nothing you can hold on to, no one you should revere. You've got no heroes. The whole thing comes down. Who's left standing? Oh, we've also got this idea from the 20th century still about Marxism. Or the 19th and 20th centuries. And no, no. I will not have the entire landscape deracinated. And then the worst ideas tried again. So basically destroy all of history and the lessons learned from history and then start from scratch and then it's completely any idea can work and then you could just take whatever. Well, and the thing is there are always some people with pre-prepared ideas. And I mentioned this also with the post-colonialists. The post-colonialists were really interesting because when the European powers were moving from Africa and the Far East, post-colonial movements had one obvious move they could have done, which was to say, since the European powers have left, we will return to a pre-colonial life, which in some of their places would have been returning to slave markets and slave ownership and slave selling and much more. But put that aside for a second. They could have said we have an indigenous culture, which we will return to almost uniformly in the post-colonial era. You had figures like France Fanon, you had European intellectuals like Sartre who said the Western powers are retreating from these countries and therefore we should institute in these countries what but Western Marxism. Well, it's not obvious to me that like the bad ideas will be the ones that emerge, but it's more likely that the bad ideas would emerge in this kind of context when you erase history, when you erase tradition. When you erase history and you leave some ideas deliberately un-interrogated. I mean, as I say, find me one in a hundred American students who've heard of any of the communist despots of the 20th century. I mean, name recognition in, there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK and like name recognition among children, school children for Stalin, let alone Mao. I mean, Mao who kills more people than anyone, 65 million Chinese perhaps. How many students in America know what Mao was, who he was, where he was? Nothing. Where the atrocities committed. Where the atrocities were committed. Or. I worry about that because it means that we might have learned one of the two lessons of the 20th century. We think we've learned one of the two lessons of the 20th century. We actually haven't learned that lesson. We've learned a little bit of it and we've not learned the other one at all because that's why we still have people in American politics and elsewhere actually talking about collectivization and things as if there's no problem with that and as if it's perfectly obvious and they could run it and they'd know exactly where to start. What are the two lessons of the 20th century? Fascism and communism. Oh yeah. I mean, I'm not exactly sure what the exactly the lessons are. No, it's not clear. The lessons were very clear that we'd be better at it. Well one is your book broadly applied of madness of crowds. That's one lesson. Well, how so? Meaning like large crowds can display herd like behavior. Yes. Be very suspicious of crowd. Yeah. In general. I mean, you apply it in different more to modern application in a sense, but it's that that's rooted in history that crowds can when, when humans get together, they can do some quite radically silly things. Elias Canetti is very good on that. Crowds and power. And Eric Hoffer, who is a sort of self-taught, amazing, not the autodidactic writer, the true believer and so on. He was extremely good on that. But the reason I mentioned the two things, no, I mean, we should have realized the two nightmares of the 20th century, fascism and communism, that we should know how they came about and we're interested in learning how one of them came about fascism. And we know some of the lessons like don't treat other people as less than you because of their race. That's one lesson. But when we've, we've done some good at learning that. But the second one, not to do communism again, not to do socialism. I think we're way away from knowing because we don't know how it happened. And the, and the little temptations are still there always. Look at the people saying, I'm going to expropriate your property. People do things they don't like. They will get to, we can't wait to take your property. Well there's a sense, there's an appealing sense. Okay. Every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it that sells the ideology. So for socialism, for communism is that there's a, it seems unfair that the working class does all of this work and gets only a fraction of the output. It just seems unfair. So you want to make it, they do get a fraction of the output. Yes. And so it seems to be more fair if we increase that, if the workers own all of the value of their output and well, the things that are more fair seems to be a good thing. I'd say, well, yeah. I mean, fairness is, I like fairness as a, no, I much prefer fairness because it's a much easier thing to try to work out. It's quite amorphous itself as a concept, but everyone can recognize it. So for instance, should the boss of the company earn a million times that of the lowest paid employee doesn't seem fair. Should they earn maybe five or 10 times the salary of the lowest paid employee? Yeah, possibly. That could be fair. There are certain sort of multiples which are within the bounds of, you know, reasonableness. I think actually that's the much bigger problem in capitalism at the moment as I see it is the not untrue perception that a tiny number of people get a lot of the, accrue a lot of the benefits and that the bit in the middle has become increasingly squeezed and is danger always of falling all the way down to the bottom. I mean, I think in the snakes and ladders of American capitalism, for instance, it's a correct perception to say that the snakes go down awfully far. If you tread on the snake, you can plummet an awfully long way in America. And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high and there's a perception and again it's not entirely wrong that the ladders system on the board is kind of broken. So what you're saying is you're a Marxist. I'm not saying I'm a Marxist. You heard that here first in the out of context blog post you're going to write about this. I get back to this point. The way to critique capitalism, if it's gone bad, is to get better capitalists. Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair. Never decide that the answer is the thing that has never produced any human flourishing, i.e. Marxism. So as you describe in the madness of crowds, the herd-like behavior of humans that gets us into trouble, you as an individual thinker and others listening to this, how can you \\u2013 because all of us are amidst crowds. We're influenced by the society that's around us, by the people that's around us. How can we think independently? How can we \\u2013 if you're in the Soviet Union at the beginning of the 20th century, if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany at the end of the 30s and 40s, how can you think independently? Given first of all that it's hard to think independently, just intellectually speaking, but also that it just becomes more and more dangerous. So the incentive to think independently under the uncertainty that's usually involved with thinking is \\u2013 I mean, it's a silly thing to say. But on Twitter there's a cost to be paid for going against the crowd on any silly thing. We can even talk about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock. There's a crowd that believes that that was unjustified. I forget what the crowd decided. Crowd split on that one. It's safe to have one opinion either way. Okay, it is. Right. But there is \\u2013 you put it very nicely \\u2013 that there's clearly a calculus here and that you can measure on Twitter, in particular you can measure the crowd, a sense of where the crowd lays. Michael Jackson. Well, oh boy. I don't want to \\u2013 this is not a legal discussion. I don't have my lawyer present. I don't even have a lawyer. The man in question is dead. But I think most people who are not just diehard fans would concede that Michael Jackson had a strange relationship with children and was almost certainly a pedophile. Is that \\u2013 did the crowd agree on that? No, the crowd hasn't agreed because he's too famous and we all love thriller. Yeah, we do. So you said people who are not fans, I just don't \\u2013 No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson, but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile. But nobody wants to give up dancing to Bad at weddings. So they just kind of added in. It's fine. Seriously, it's a genius. Your law does not apply to Bill Cosby. Oh, that's \\u2013 well, he wasn't \\u2013 he was, of course, one of the most famous people in America, but maybe he wasn't regarded as talented. Oh, wow. There's depth to this calculation. Oh, yeah. There's a genius opt-out in all cultures. There's a genius opt-out in all cultures. Look at Lord Byron. Lord Byron shagged his sister. Doesn't affect his reputation. In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it. But then again, this kind of war against the West, geniuses actually makes you more likely or no to get canceled. So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson or \\u2013 Well, yes, because if you haven't done anything, remarkable, nobody will come looking for you possibly. Okay. Yeah. Genius can get you in trouble eventually. Okay. Sidle through life with nobody noticing. Be totally harmless and then die and hope you haven't used any carbon. But you were asking about how to survive the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds. And there's a very simple answer to that. Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world. Oh, come on. But this is still human psychology because you want to fit in. There's a \\u2013 Why? Because you like people and you're just as a \\u2013 Why not just like a small number of people and ignore the rest? Yeah, that's \\u2013 That's what I do. Well, I mean, I actually like most people. This isn't a general thing. I don't have detestation for most people at all. Most people I kind of enjoy speaking with and being with. But in terms of storing your sense of self-worth in absolute strangers, big mistake. Yeah. And for me, that's \\u2013 let's turn it into a therapy session. For me, and I think I represent some number of populations, I'm pretty self-critical. I'm looking for myself in the world. And there is a depth of connection with people on the internet. I mean, I have some \\u2013 I think there's a shallowness of it. It's shallow connection. Interesting. I \\u2013 Put it this way. If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help? On the internet? No. No. Good. But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right. Your very close friends would help. Family would help. Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps that's the only thing \\u2013 You can't store significant amounts of trust or faith or belief or self-worth in places which will not return it to you. Okay. So let's talk about the more extreme case, the harsher case. When you talk about the things you talk about in the war on the West and madness of crowds, I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure. As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly with a zen-like look on your face. So you don't \\u2013 all you need is Sam Harris to say that you're brilliant and you're happy. No, I love Sam. I'm deeply pleased when he flatters me and he's nice about me, but no, I don't just rely on Sam. No, I mean, why would I mind? Maybe it's self-selecting. If I didn't have the view I had about that or whatever armory it is that I have on that, I wouldn't do what I did maybe. Have you been to some dark places psychologically because of the challenging ideas you explore? Like significant self-doubt, just kind of \\u2013 I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life. By any means, that would make me an automaton of some kind. There's definitely times I've got things wrong and regretted that. There's times I've \\u2013 there was a period around the time I wrote my book, The Strange Death of Europe, which was a very, very dark time. It wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life, but because of the book I was writing. Oh, because of the place you had to go in order to write the book. Well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization. Occasionally now, I have maybe slightly too pat at this stage, but sometimes readers come up to me in the street or whatever and say, you know, I love The Strange Death of Europe and will say, you know, it's a very depressing book to read, however. I would say, well, you should have tried writing it. It was because it has chunks of it, which I'm very proud of in particular, about the death of religion, the death of God, the loss of meaning and the void. That's difficult stuff to write about and to grapple with. There is a sort of \\u2013 I haven't reread that book since it came out, but I think there are passages in it which reveal what I was thinking very clearly in the poetry of it as it were, as well as the detail. But yeah, I can't say \\u2013 I'm used to saying what I think and what I see. And if there's any pushback I've got from that, I'm completely consoled that I'm saying what I see with my own eyes. That's your source of strength, is that you're always seeking the truth as best you see it. Well, I can't agree to go along with a lie if I've seen something with my own eyes. Do you ever \\u2013 so speaking of Sam Harris, and I mentioned to you offline, a lot of people \\u2013 I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life on this podcast, and a lot of them will reference you as their example of a very smart person. So given that compliment, do you ever worry that your ego grows to a level where you're not \\u2013 what you think is the truth is no longer the truth. Is this kind of \\u2013 it blinds you. And also, on top of that, the fact that you stand against the crowd often, that there's part of it that appeals to you, that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes. I get a certain thrill from the friction. Yeah, that sometimes both your ego and the thrill of friction will get you to deviate from the truth and instead just look for the friction. Could do. Could do for sure. I try to keep alive to that. Early in my career, I realized that, for instance, I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily any more than strictly necessary because there was a very large number of already necessary enemies. And I remember once \\u2013 I won't go into the details, but I already had one sort of thing I'd done that week, and then another thing came out. I just thought, I can't do that. And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person who's forever creating storms. And I tried to make sure I wasn't. And I think I pretty much stuck to that. But to answer your question, well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be that I wouldn't fall into the trap you described for two reasons. I mean, one is that I don't think of myself as a wildly intelligent person, partly because I'm very, very aware of the things I know nothing about. I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge of the details of finance or economic theory. I mean, the real details. I don't mean the big picture of the kind that we were just discussing earlier. If you put the periodic table in front of me, I would struggle to do more than a handful. I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge. And where I have gaps or chasms, I tend to find I have a disproportionate admiration for the people who know that stuff. Like I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money, really understand it. I think, how the hell do you do that? And the same thing with biologists, medics, stuff I just know very little about. And that's a source of humility for you, just knowing that. Yes. I mean, I think, well, I'm going to get on that stuff. But Jesus, if you got me on the general knowledge, I would say that thing some years ago, there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge. I was asked some years ago on to, there's a sort of psych celebrity, one of former students of the universities or colleges asked to go back for the Christmas special. And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one. And the only reason I actually wanted to do it was because I discovered that Louis Theroux had been to my college before my time and he'd agreed to be on the team. And I thought I'd love to meet Louis Theroux, that'd be great fun. And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don't want to do it. And they said, come on, you'd be great. I said, I wouldn't, I'd show myself up to be a total asshole and ignoramus. And as it was, I sat down my flat and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge. I just sat mute for the whole half hour. I just couldn't, the first question was about physics and the second one was about, as it was, I watched the one and I could answer the first two or three questions of the one that actually went out because they made it a bit simpler. But I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the, and I said to the producers, I said, I can't go on because I just couldn't answer the questions. These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer a whole range of things. So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations and you can't apply your limitations. Yeah, and they're forever before me, you know, not hard to find in every day. And then on top of that, I suppose it's, in a way, you know that line from Rudyard Kipling's alternately brilliant and slightly nauseating poem, If. There's a line- You just enjoy a good poem, can you? Well, no, it's not, I can enjoy a great poem, but I mean, a good poem. This is slightly off. This goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky. Take Douglas's criticism with a grain of salt. Maybe I've heard it read at too many memorial services and things, but that line is a good piece of advice. If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster and meet these, greet these two imposters just the same. That's a good line. It's a good line, as Kipling often did, an amazing turn of the line. But I do think that it's a very sensible thing to try to greet triumph and disaster and regard them as imposters and greet them just the same. And actually anyone who knows me knows that I never, partly it's because I have a sort of belief in the old gods and at the moment that I thought that I was at the moment of triumph, the fates would hitch up their skirts and run at me at a million miles an hour. But it's also because I, anyone who knows me knows I never have a moment when I say that's just great. I feel totally fulfilled and victorious. I mean, it happened to me recently when the war on the west went straight in at number one in the bestseller list. How long did that last in terms of your self-satisfaction? Didn't happen. Not even for a brief moment. No. When I first saw that it was selling, I had that moment of elation. I thought, good, I've done it, it's out. And I did have a moment of elation then, definitely, but it doesn't last partly because I tell myself it mustn't last. Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt. Is that skirts? You brits with your poetry, even when it's nauseating. As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis of the political leadership and the human mind and the human being of Donald Trump? I sort of avoided this for years. Just talking about Trump. I tried to avoid talking about Trump for years. It's the same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit. Do you think that Trump, just sorry on a small tangent, do you think the Trump story is over or are we just done with volume one? I have no idea the people I know who know him say that he's running. And I think that in general, Republicans do have a choice in front of them. One friend put it to me recently said, you've got to go in with your toughest fighter. And I understand that instinct. And I also think it's very dangerous instinct, because what if your toughest fighter is also your biggest liability? What's the best way to get it out of the Democrat vote in 2024 than to have Donald Trump running? And the people that are doing the war in the West are pretty tough fighters. They are. And I'm cautious about this because I know every way I tread is dangerous. But let me just be frank. Tread gracefully. I'll tread as gracefully as I can. My Wellington boots. My galoshes. Here's the thing. I think everybody knows what Trump is. I think we all knew for years. And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend that he was something he wasn't. I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend that, for instance, he was some devout Christian or a man of faith or a man of great integrity or all of these sorts of things. Because in the public eye for years, it had been obvious that wasn't the case. But he has something extraordinary. One thing is a method of communication that you've just got to say is, was unbelievable. In one fundamental way that you can't look away for some reason. Can't look away. I mean, watching him clear everyone out of the way in 2016 was thrilling because those people needed clearing away. You know, it's just horrifying. What America is going to give us another Bush? What's so great about this family? America is going to give us another Clinton. We're going to choose to bring Clinton on the Bush. Mark Stein said, whatever, we'll just wait for the day that Clinton is in the Bushes into Marion and then we can really have a monarchy again. So I was very pleased to see him clear them away. I was very pleased to see him sort of raise some of the issues that needed raising. I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air and I wished it wasn't him doing it. And then there was the question of him governing and it was just perfectly clear he didn't know how to govern. What he did have, however, what he does have is an incredible ability to fight. And some of the forces he was arraigned against were arraigned against him. My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else. I mean, they'd have probably done some similar BS against Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio. They'd have said, some people admitted, they'd have accused all these people of racism and misogyny and everything else as well, just like they did Mitt Romney, just like they did John McCain. But Trump was the one ugly enough and bruisey enough to fight. And also a willingness or a lack of willingness to play sort of the civil game of politics or at a party when like politeness gets you in trouble. You show up and everybody's polite and you just out of momentum want to be polite. And all of a sudden you're on an island with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you into a huge amount of trouble. But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities, but I just, you know, look, he screwed up during his time in office because he didn't achieve as much as he should have done. Now you could say that about every president, but I refuse to acknowledge that two years when he had both houses in the first, the beginning, he just didn't know what levers to pull. You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news. I'm sorry, that's not a president. And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions because people knew, I mean, people who were very loyal to him, he would just, you know, he'd get them to do something loyal and then destroy them. And I think, and then we get onto the thing about, and here we get onto the, you know, that of course is very, very fractures to rain, but you know, I covered the 2020 election and I was traveling all around the States and I went to Trump rally and, and all sorts of stuff. And I, I was in DC on election night and, um, went and it got very ugly at one point, um, in so-called black lives matter Plaza. When it looked like Trump might win, when Florida came in and got really, I could feel the air were very, very heated and like some Antifa people started getting into black block and this sort of stuff. And I thought this town is going to burn, you know, if Trump wins. And in the aftermath of the vote, I was willing to hang around in Washington for a bit. And then I saw it was going to drag on. And I saw some of his people and others and people told me they had great evidence of vote rigging and all this sort of thing. And I'm afraid I'm one of those people who doesn't believe that the evidence that they presented is good enough to justify the claim that he won the election. And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 mules and have you seen it? Look, the evidence isn't there that the, that the election was won by Donald Trump. And I think that what he did on January the 6th was unbelievably dangerous. And you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas in our head at the same time. January the 6th was not nothing, nor was it an insurrection and attempt to stage a coup. And there's a vanishing number of people in the U S or as Eric Weinstein said, it's like, this is the roof that you have to walk along. And like the sides are very steep. If you fall off either side. Is there some sense given the forces that are waging war in the West? He said this feeling perhaps because of Antifa or something else that this town is going to burn and maybe a continued feeling that this town is going to burn with the January 6th events. Are you worried about the future of the United States in the coming years because of the, there's a feeling of escalation. Is that just a war of Twitter or is there, is there a real brewing of something? Oh, it's real. And how, well, let me then respond to that. How, what is the hopeful, if you, if you 10 years from now, look back at the United States and say, we turned it around, what would be the reason? What would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so? I'll tell you, since I, since I wrote this book, there are two things in particular that I've been really pleased that a specific type of specialist has approached me on to say that things I've written about actually have more application than I realized. One is the gratitude issue. A number of people have approached me who have gone through AA, alcoholics anonymous. They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA? And I said, that's a bit personal question. But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say, well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation or alcohol anonymous, uh, uh, no McDonald's doesn't sound very anonymous. You stand up in a room, you say your name and you tell everyone the worst things you've ever done. That's the opposite of anonymous. Anyhow, but they say, uh, look, because if you go to these things, apparently you're asked to as part of your recovery, say what you're grateful for, like list what you're grateful for. I didn't know that by the way, until, until, until the book was out. And so it turned out to have more applications than I knew. The other thing though, is that I say that it's absolutely crucial in America that we try to find things that we agree on. And a couple of times since the book came out, I've been approached by people who have marriage counselors. Um, but we've also said, I mean, if you've ever been through marriage counseling, again, that's a very personal question. Stop asking me personal questions. No, but they, and I said, well, why? And he, well, because this is, this is one of the things that we do in couples therapy is try to find things you agree on. And I think this is very important in America and it's made much harder by the fact. And I've said this many times, but forgive me if I'm repeating myself, but it's made much harder by the fact that having different opinions is very last century. Now we all have different facts or at least the two sides have different facts. One half of the country roughly, or let's say 40%, 30% whatever you want to put it with a tired minority in the middle. One segment of the country believes that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election and that the Russians interfered and got Donald Trump into power. Another half of the country believes that Donald Trump won the 2020 election. If you can't agree on who wins elections, it's very hard to see who you, what you agree on as a country. That's one of the reasons I mind the war on American history and Western history is one of the things you have to agree on is at least some attitude towards your past. You don't have to go on everything, but like the public square has to have public heroes who are agreed to be heroes to some extent, warts and all. If you don't have that, if actually you think for instance like half the country thinks founding fathers were pretty good, the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten racists and so on. If half the country basically thinks it would have been better if Columbus had taken a different turn, never found America, gone back home and said nothing out there, that would have been better. And the other half is pretty glad in the end that we've got America. We've got to agree on something. And I just see in America, so I do think we've got to try to find things to agree on, like a reasonable attitude towards the past. That's why that matters. And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say that everything in the American past was good. God knows that wouldn't stand up to a second scrutiny or self scrutiny. But nor was it all bad. This wasn't a country formed in sin and in an eradicable sin. It wasn't founded in 1619 in order to make the country wicked and incapable of escaping that wickedness. These are things that will matter enormously in the years ahead. Because if you can't agree on anything, including who your heroes are, the whole thing is just one massive division. And we'll see what I think we're already seeing, which is people basically going to states where it's more like the life they want to live. And some people say to me, well, that's okay. And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that. That's possible, but it's also it eradicates part of what has been American public life, which is the ability to look at each other and discuss face to face. And I see things like this bomb placed under America the other week with the Supreme Court League, the draft league, as being just a further example of that. I'm very, very worried about it in America. And because if America screws up everything, everything else in the world goes. Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded and has been able to live out in better and better forms, sort of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles versus- With the desire to improve. Yeah, constantly. An imperfect union. Yeah. Well, as I generally have hope that people want to sort of, in terms of gratitude, people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful. It's a better life psychologically. The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within. So I just feel that people will long for that and will find that. That's the American way. Same with the division that we reveal now has to do with new technologies like social media that kind of is a small kind of deviation from the path we're on because it's a new, we've got a new toy, just like nuclear weapons. Which is relatively new. But we need to find reasonable attitudes towards these things. That's why I say it matters how you and my feedback on social media because we're all going through it to some extent. We're learning. And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad. I say this, that was my minimalist call to friends in this era was the main job is not to go insane. Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, like walk towards sanity. Because I'm sure there's a Hunter S. Thompson quote in there. Insanity on the weekends can be at least fun. Okay. Do you have advice for young people that just put down their tech talk and are listening to this podcast in high school and college about how to have a career or how to have a life they can be proud of? So a broad question, but of course, I mean, I can give specific advice for people who want to be writers and so on, but that's a bit niche maybe. Well, writers will be very interesting, sorry to interrupt. Also how to put your ideas down on paper and think that the ideas develop them and have the guts to go to a large audience. Especially when the ideas are sort of controversial or dangerous or difficult. Well, the main thing to do is to read. When I was a schoolboy, I would ever have a book in my pocket, side pocket of my jacket on his side pocket and would read. And that wasn't just so swattish in some way, but because I discovered probably at some point in my early teens, I discovered something I wrote about this once. I discovered that books were dangerous, which was a thrilling discovery. I discovered they could contain anything. And also people didn't know what you were reading. I remember I got far too young an age. I read the Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley and I didn't make head or tail of it probably, but I knew that it was about something really interesting and dangerous. And I thought constantly when I read poetry or read history, I was just constantly thrilled and wanted to know more. And if you want to become a writer, you have to be a reader. You have to read the best stuff. And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is and you'll find the people that really impress you. But I know I just came across certain writers who just knocked me off my feet. And when you find those people, read everything and cling on to them and find other people like that, find other writers like that, people who are connected by history or scholarship or circles or whatever. For you, was it fiction or nonfiction? Is there a particular book that you just remember where it just gave you pause? Well, I remember that the first book that absolutely threw me was The Lord of the Flies by William Golding, which used to be a signed text and everyone's a bit snotty about because it's so popular. But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book I read in that I had been used to the world of children's literature, of everything ends up fine in the end, the lost all get found. This was the first book I read where that's not the case, where the world turns out differently. And I remember for days afterwards, I was just in a state of shock. I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered. And partly because I sort of intuited it must be true. And of course, that is not to say that The Lord of the Flies, there's lots of scholarship on what children do in the situation of being on the island or when they do congregate and anyhow. But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world. And it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it. It was dangerous. And it was dangerous. And then of course, when I became interested in sex, let alone when I realized I was gay, I realized books were a very, very good way to learn about what I was. And that was even more dangerous in a way. And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know. You discovered sex? That was an invention in books? What do you mean? No, what I mean is that one of the things that gay people have when they're growing up is that you have this terribly big secret and you don't think the world will ever know, you hope the world will never know. And it's been called by one psychologist, the little boy with a big secret. And so if you discover that other people have the same secret, there's a sort of, thank God for that. But I mean, that's just a version of what everybody gets in reading in a way, which is the thrill of discovery that somebody else thought something you thought only you'd thought. I mean, one of the greatest thrills in all of literature is when a voice comes from across the centuries and seems to leave a handprint. It makes you feel a little bit less alone because somebody else feels, sees the world the same way, is the same way. That's what C.S. Lewis said to have said, we read to know we're not alone. But we don't only read to know we're not alone, we read to become other people. I mean, I think I saw in books a version of the life I wanted to live and then I decided to live it. And I'm fortunate enough to have done so. I wanted to live in the world of ideas and books and debate. I wanted to live in the debates of my time. And I remember when, like a lot of people, I read Auden when I was young. And certain lines obviously stuck with me. But that poem of his, which everybody knows and which he hated, September 1st, 1939, I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me. I was sitting on a dive for a second as we degraded and alone at the end of a low, dishonest decade. But of course, there's a problem with that line, which is you kind of want to be living at the end of a low, dishonest decade as well. It sounds sort of cool in a way. You're the only person who sees it. But so yeah, anyhow, that's the diversion. But the point is, if you want to be a writer, you've got to be a reader. And from anything else, you discover the the lilt of language and the things you can do. And I've read people who, and I still do, who I think, my God, I didn't know, how did you do that? In fact, books for me now and articles and other things fall into two categories. One is I know how you did that. And the other is I don't know how you did that. And the best feeling as a writer is when you do the second one. And it happens occasionally in my writing life. Will you almost like return to something you've written or like right after you know, the moment you write it, you wonder how did I do that? Yes. That's that's the most I've never said that before. That's the happiest thing in writing. Yeah, very occasionally it sounds but I mean, I've occasionally finished something. Funny enough, it happened some years ago in a long piece I wrote about the artist Basquiat. I finished the piece and I gasped. I didn't know because because that's also a thing with writing is you you it's not sometimes people say you need to write in order to know what you think. That's not quite true. Sometimes you that's a very bad piece of advice for some writers who don't know what they think and it's not going to become clear if they just start typing. But yeah, sometimes it is true that you there's a thought that's just waiting there and a clarity that comes across and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain and by the time you typed it you you just go. Yes. That's the greatest feelings. Almost like it came from somewhere else. That's what Bakunin says about you know, what's the moment is Tom Stoppard's favorite quote about Bakunin saying what happens in the moment where the writer's pen when he pauses, where does he go in that moment? Yeah, that's so interesting. Because I think the answer to that question will help us explain consciousness and all those other weird things about the human mind. So that was advice for writers. I didn't really give any advice for people in general. Is that oh you want to give health advice? No. To channel Churchill and... No, I don't want to give health advice. Clearly because you implied that Churchill was one of your early guides in that aspect. So when you discovered your sexuality, let me ask about love. Too personal, far too personal of a question to ask a Brit. But what was that like and broadly speaking, what's the role of love in the human condition? Sex and love and for you personally, discovering that you were and maybe telling the world that you were gay. I'm very perilously personal. I do actually have a sort of rule that I don't talk about in my personal life. Rules are meant to be broken. Okay, well I'll break it a little bit. One of the ways in which growing up and realizing you're gay differs from growing up and being straight is that it's almost inevitable that your first passions will be unrequited. Oh wow, I never thought about that. Now that's not to say, I mean, there's plenty of unrequited love among young men for young women, young women for young men, plenty of that. But it's almost inevitable if you're gay that your first passions will be totally unrequited because the odds are that the person in question will not be gay. So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak. Is heartbreak and disappointment. Heartbreak can be beautiful too. It's formative. Well, again, it comes back to the thing if you're a writer or something, because you can always do something with it. That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted. I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here. No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers because you always think, well, I could use that. It's dangerous. It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware of it. It's almost like a drug, right? No, it's not like a drug. It's the fear that all things, even the greatest suffering, it could be material. What's the danger in that exactly? That seeing the material in the human experience, you don't experience it fully? You don't experience it fully and you might be using it. I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s. And he said he knew at the moment he was told about his friend's death, a tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem. And he did and the poem was wonderful, but there's always that slight guilt for writers of am I going to use that? Anyhow, that's a divergence. Life is full of guilty pleasures. And I think that's one of them because if you feel that guilt, really what you're doing is you're capturing that moment and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people by writing about that moment because it's going to stimulate something that resonates with those people because it's similar kinds of memories about a loss and a passion towards somebody that they had to lose. So don't, you know, yes, but there is a good sign. More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones or bad places and wanting to find bad stories because it's useful. And there is a definite guilt you get from that sort of thing. Like the worse the situation, the more useful. Anyhow, no, so that's, that's sort of the only difference that happens from growing up being gay. And it means that most, certainly in my generation, most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later. And there's lots of explanations of that maybe being one of the reasons for perceived or otherwise promiscuity among gay men, which is I think more easily persuaded by the fact that gay men behave like men would if women were men. That's one explanation, but it's both a feature and a bug that you come to sexual flourishing later in life that could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life, that could be a positive or a negative. But what's broadly speaking is the role of love in the human condition, Douglas. Well it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point. What is the point? What's, what's the meaning of life? Let's go there. So what's the meaning is a hard one, of course. Where is the meaning is slightly easier. And I'd say that everyone can find that. You gravitate towards the places you find meaning. Now there's a conservative answer to this, which is quite useful and it's certainly more useful than any others because the conservative answer is find meaning where people have found it before. Which is a very, very good answer. If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship or a particular canon of work, go there because it's been proven by time to be able to give you the goods. It's much more sensible than saying, hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning. But love is, love is probably the nearest thing we can have to the divine on earth. And of course, the problem of what exactly, what type of love we mean is an issue. Well, that goes to the fact that you don't like definitions anyway. I do like definitions. I just think they need to be pinned down, but let's not go there at the moment because it's... Let's not pin down love at the moment? Well, no, because as you know, I mean, because of the different varieties of love and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture and that it means an awful lot of things and we don't delineate it well. But let's say human love with the greatest fulfillment in sexual love with another person is probably the greatest intimation you can have of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love. And it's the sense that all young lovers have, which is that they've just walked through the low door in the garden and found themselves in bliss. And that this is... There's a beautiful, beautiful poem of... Can I read it to you? Yes, please. I'll try to find it. There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkin's, which slightly says what I'm... And try not to duck your question by referring to other people, but... Maybe that's the best way to answer the question. Could be. Is to read a poem. So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows, which is remarkable because he came to sexual... He had a rather unhappy sex life, but he came to sexual fruition in the 40s and 50s and all the hell that that involved. And he took what I regard as being a really remarkable and important view on the sexual revolution in the 60s, which is that most people who he's generated, most older people resented the young. They resented the freedom they had and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible and it was always getting lurkily. And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly, he was a very conservative person, took a different view and he says it in his poem. And the opening of the poem is he says, when I see a couple of kids and guess he's fucking her and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm, I know this is paradise. One old is dreamed of all their lives, bonds and gestures pushed to one side like an outdated combine harvester and everyone young going down the long slide to happiness endlessly. I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought that will be the life no God anymore or sweating in the dark about hell and that or having to hide what you think of the priest. He and his lot will all go down the long slide like free bloody birds. And immediately rather than words comes the thought of high windows, the sun comprehending glass and beyond it, the deep blue air that shows nothing and is nowhere and is endless. The divine, he found it. He found it in seeing a couple of young kids and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm. Do you see it? I mean, it's first of all, it's very counterintuitive. But secondly, this is the point that sex had been so tied up with misery. I mean, people don't remember this now when they talk about the past. I mean, there's one of my favorite books, Stefan's likes the world of yesterday, including the descriptions of what it was like trying to have sex in pre first world war Vienna, you know, all the men ended up going to female prostitutes. They, you know, so many of them got syphilis and this was their first experience with sex. It was so goddamn awful and they were stuck with it all their lives. And so there's lots of stuff that's gone better in our last century. That's one of them. But you ask about love. Yes, I do think that love is basically the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine. And by the way, sex, liberating sex doesn't buy you love. No, I mean, it throws in an entirely, it threw in another set of problems. If there's any meaning on top of all of that is we like to find problems and solve that as a human species. And sometimes we even create problems. Douglas, thank you for highlighting all the problems of human civilization and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future. This is an incredible conversation. Thank you for talking today. It's a huge honor. Thank you. It's very kind of you to say that. Thank you. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Douglas Murray to support this podcast.
